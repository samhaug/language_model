{"55QL7na9kvQ": "man look I'm as excited today about what we're gonna do is anything I've done in a while it's winter time late winter here in south Louisiana and the fishes just not the best right now it's going to get a lot better soon but right now it's just tough well a great thing to do in the off season is to figure out what your lures look like underwater we all kind of wonder that as we're fishing right you wonder what are the fish seeing what's making fish hit what's making them perhaps not hit well getting some lures on a swimming pool will teach you a lot about how your lord looks when you do certain things with the rod not only that but how different weights of jig heads and and different lures look differently underwater well today we're going to show you some of that I'm gonna put some GoPros in the pool I'm as excited to learn what you're gonna learn today is anybody because this is going to teach me as much as it's going to teach you and I can't wait to do it so what we got here is a long punching rod got braided line on it nice and strong and what I did is I tied it to a stick inside of a traffic cone on top of the traffic cone I have a clamp with a GoPro I'm gonna lower this into the water and that will provide us a great perspective on how these lures look underwater now look this pool hasn't been used in months it is loaded with leaves it looks like a swamp but at least the water still clean so that's going to tell us all we need to know I'm excited to do this I really can't wait alright so I got the camera on I'm just gonna lower it into the water [Music] [Music] I guess the hardest part is going to be getting it angled correctly yes it is there we go perfect all right that's gonna work it's gonna work well [Music] here in south Louisiana everybody fishes soft plastic paddle tails with various jig head weights very popular weight is 3/8 ounce because it really kind of works well in depth of 10 feet or more maybe even eight feet or more but I've definitely found over my career that lighter jig heads work better in certain situations so I really want to see how a bait looks differently underwater jig depending on the heaviness of the jig head so I'm starting with the 3/8 ounce jig head this is a limbo sliced colored matrix shad one with a real bright color bait so you could see it underwater so let's see how it looks [Music] all right so obviously we're we're recasting right now is about four feet that's not exactly real-world if I was fishing for feet I would never go with the 3000 you can see how that beach is barely hops off the bottom this is how my rod motion would be if I was fishing this bait I would not be moving at much at all I'd just be kind of crawling it [Music] all right so what everybody knows is that fish tend to bite a lure on the fall so you want that lure falling as long as possible and slowly as possible so it's really tantalizing on the way down so I'm gonna do I'm a cash right in front of the camera lens so you can see this bait as it's falling and see how good it looks and that's the look that you really want so now we're gonna see how differently the lure looks we put this exact same bait on a 1/8 ounce jig head all right so here we go with the 1/8 ounce a lot lighter jighead let's see how it looks in front of the camera okay one thing that immediately jumps out at me and I wasn't expecting this this bait is falling so slowly with this 1/8 ounce weight that the tails not even flapping on the way down I almost kind of think that's gonna hurt you [Music] look at that it looks almost like a dead stick just falling down on the water with a lot less tail action now a positive is that when I do retrieve the bait it stays up and falls much more slowly so there is a longer duration of the fall than with the 3/8 ounce but the tail action again is just not as good even on those Falls the initial fall as well as the hops all right so my research is definitely paying off and I got to tell you my hypothesis is proven to be a little bit inaccurate because I thought what was going to happen is that this law is gonna look a lot better on a 1/8 ounce than a 3/8 ounce and it really kind of doesn't it doesn't look as good now the fall rate is a lot slower and there will be times obviously that's going to help you but I like that tail action on the 3/8 ounce and you know this dissipate in general has a great deal amount of tail action so it's not like it's just a stiff bait that needs a lot of weight to make it move so still it's going to be some trial and error with fishing locations obviously you never want to throw a twenty thousand in swift current areas or in very very deep areas and I have had fishing trips where we did much better on on lighter jig heads than on heavy jig heads but I don't know I think I kind of sold the 3/8 ounce short a little bit I'm uh I'm more client to use it in the future even a little bit shallower water alright so it wasn't planning on doing this I was only going to do an eighth and a 3/8 but my mind is so blown I want to see what happens on a quarter ounce so we're gonna go right in the middle with a quarter ounce weight and see how that changes the motion of the bait all right first cast with the quarter ounce I'm truly excited to see what happens here Wow okay not a lot of tail accident on that either definitely better than the three than the one eighth but not like we had not like we have with the three eighth not at all really really slow fall and look let's be honest it's not only the tail action of a bait that attracts bites it's also how you work it but that tail action definitely can be a difference maker on tough days [Music] okay so let's see if the next axiom is also this Peru everybody knows breed has no stretch Manos got a lot of stretch so when you're fishing with parade a slight movement of the rod tip it has a big impact on the bait fishing with mono you can be much more whippy with the end of that rod it's gonna have less of an impact on the bait so I'm going to make casts with braided line of course I got a fluorocarbon leader tied on gonna make some other cast with monofilament and see how the motions of the right tip impact the bait underwater you [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so I think I know what that footage is gonna show but I'm gonna discover it when you do I can tell what I'm feeling here when I'm fishing definitely that mono is way spongy err but how much does it really affect that bait underwater all right the last pool check is gonna be weight of a jig head under a cork I am a big believer then use an extremely light jig heads when fishing under a cork because that bait falls so much more slowly looks much more like a shrimp and I think almost all the time speckled trout and redfish even bass and our coastal marshes I think they think they're feeding on shrimp even though what we're throwing them our paddle tail soft plastics you want it falling as slowly as possible but I really want to see I'm excited to see how quickly these baits fall with the various jig heads so what I'm gonna start with here is a quarter ounce really nobody fishes a 3/8 ounce under cork if you do that's really overkill but I got a quarter ounce here what I generally fish myself is a 1/16 ounce so I want to see the difference and how that looks underwater let's go check it out [Music] [Music] [Music] man that was so much fun I learned a lot just even watching the Lord's in the pool but I really can't wait to get home and check out the footage now obviously I had one of my tenants of my fishing philosophies kind of blown or at least I think I did I'm gonna get home and see if I did but another one was absolutely confirmed no doubt in my mind fishing those lighter jig heads under corks is a lot better now guessing the underwater footage is going to show that this bait was producing no tail action on this one sixteenth ounce jig head look at that jig that's tiny ooh tiny but I don't think it matters because I think again that the game fish in our marshes or thinking that that is a shrimp not a minnow or Kruk or anything trying to get away from they think it's a shrimp have you seen a shrimp falling in the water column it doesn't have a whole lot of action at all just Falls and then every now and then it'll pop and that's what happens when you pop the cork it that bait jumps up and it just barely falls you got that heavy jig head on there it's going down much more quickly yeah you might have a little bit of tail action but I think that slow fall in the water column is that what really inspires them to feed my philosophy anyway I'm gonna get home and see what all this shows well that's it hopefully you enjoyed

didn't actually think to put milliliters and ounces together I think of everything in ounces I'm an American bartender I think an ounces so I put ounces and I got a lot of people requesting the milliliters so then I started putting milliliters but when I put in the milliliters now and when I started doing it I actually based it off this [ __ ] now this [ __ ] it estimates and kind of rounds up and down what the milliliters are but I'm assuming that the actual liquid measurement is correct the thing is is that I use this in almost every single one of my videos and so I thought that it would be the smartest thing to do would be to call out the milliliters on the side of this [ __ ] so for instance we know that half an ounce is 14.8 something something something something milliliters right obviously the makers of this trigger are not going to put that long number on this so what they're going to do is around it so they rounded it up to 15 milliliters and then we also know that 3/4 of an ounce is 22.5 so this one rounded it to 20 and so on and so forth so on this [ __ ] even though the liquid volume is correct honest it is a rounded measurement of 15 20 30 for 1 ounce 45 for an ounce and 1/2 60 for 2 ounces and 75 for 2 and a half ounces my question to you is this would you guys rather I keep it with the rounded measurements as seen on this sugar or would you rather I put the full milliliter measurement on there so 22 point 5 and so on and so forth because as a result you know I've been doing 0.25 ounces so a quarter of an ounce I've been doing that as 5 milliliters which is what it is here but honestly it's closer to 7.5 mililiters anyway I just got a comment by my number one fan in England Lee Clark today saying that he would rather that I had so I'm just gonna take a consensus he would rather that I do the actual milliliter measurement despite what it says on the sugar I am going to ask you guys and put it to a vote you guys comment below and tell me which you would want and we will do what you ask because we really like to cater that to the people who really want to see the milliliters on here all right see you next time and on the next tutorial", "KusQ9H9gETM": "hey everybody Carolina gun guy here so just a disclaimer before I get going if you've been shooting shotguns your whole life this video may not be for you what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take a look at different types of shotgun shells show you what's inside of them I got a slug I got double-aught buck all the way up to eight shot right here so I'm gonna take a look at different ones and show you what's inside but I'm also gonna tell you how many pellets are inside because I sat down and counted them and I kind of have a good idea so stick around if you have an interest in shotgun shells and you want to know a little bit more about them and we'll go through and have a good time South Carolina gun school is more than just a gun school with over a dozen classes including pistol rifle shotgun concealed carry and vehicle tactics you're guaranteed to find something for you if you're anywhere near Greenville South Carolina check them out at SC gun school calm this chart shows standard sizes of shotgun shells all the way from triple op buck to number 12 which is birdshot you can see there's not much difference between the sizes the diameter is the size of the pellet inside the shotgun shell so double-aught buck is 0.33 inches number eight is 0.09 inches that's how big the pellets are the difference is incrementally smaller like you can see between bbbbb and B no I didn't just have a stroke but between the triple B it's 0.19 inches then BB is point 1 8 and B is point 1 7 so it doesn't change that much I'm gonna focus for this video on the double-aught buck size 2 4 6 and 8 birdshot so now that you saw the chart I'm not going to show you what I have here first I have a slug a slug is just a 1 ounce piece of lead you can see it's hollow toward the back but it's mostly solid towards the front like from here on out the 1 ounce piece of land that will just be shoot out and it's pretty straightforward just like a large bullet that comes all your shotgun shell shotgun next I have double-aught buck right here and the bullet itself the shotgun shell itself tells you there's nine pellets in there you can see it right there so you get nine pellets and this is one of the reasons that a shotgun is such a good idea for a home defense gun because you do get nine projectiles with each shot if you don't believe me ask your Biden put that double-barrel shotgun and fire to blasts so the next one I have are all birdshot and I'll leave the shell in there so you can get an idea of the the pellets so that is a number two shot number four six and eight you see the pellets get incrementally smaller as you go up with the eight next to the two so you can see how small those pellets are don't need thirty rounds to protect yourself by shotgun so this is just me shooting my targets I've playing card stock targets I forgot to mention earlier than the anatomy of a shotgun shell if you're standing one up you got the case with the primer then you have the Gunpowder and then a wad which is like a plastic piece which separates the the powder from the actual pellets and then you have the pellets of soph at the top so I just shot this to the two four six and eight shot walked closer and you can see the size of the pellets that the spread that they make so that's the 2 4 and this pellets gets smaller and smaller the holes get smaller after you get closer as I go along because the pellets are so much smaller but it's time to get to that eighth spot and I'll do a quick close-up to show you the size of that wad hole and it sounds dirty now I sat and counted the number of holes in each target so that would give me a good idea of gonna move pellets in each one so this is the two shot right here and obviously you got the parts where the wad goes through so there could have been some pellets in there but on the two-shot there were 129 individual holes so about 130 to 140 pellets I think on the fourth shot I got 154 now remember the 2 shot was the larger shell to 3-inch shell so on a two and three-quarter inch shell there's probably gonna be a little bit less but on the four shot there were 150 four and little holes in here by the time you got the six shot there's 264 little tiny holes and on the eighth shot 363 that I counted all together and you can see right there where I did my double-aught buck it was grouped pretty well you got the 9 hole from that buck right there so overall these targets or these pieces of paper about I don't know 24 inches by 36 inches so they had a pretty good spread they're each about a foot and a half out and I was surprised to find 363 pellets in the a shot and since I had to open up all the shells is no point in let the powder go to waste thanks for watching guys I really appreciate it I hope you found something interesting here if you did give the video a like hit that subscribe button I really appreciate you guys watching my videos so take care and God bless", "iN63V5NDLMs": "I was going to do another question and answer video but I really didn't have any there's any really specific questions about create X so to speak some people are confused about mixing ratios and things like that you know your typical 2 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 2 all that stuff what's what and how much and how to do that and so I'm going to try to explain that real quick this is my test piece I was doing and I use just a regular opaque blue and I poured some into some little bottles and then I mixed one with future and I mixed one with them create a center but I mix them at different ratios with the with the create X thinner I mixed it two to one two parts of paint to one part of the reducer the first number is always the paint always always always always the paint that's the industry standard just think of it this way the first thing you pour in your bottle is your paint that's the first thing you you always go to is your paint okay then you add your thinner or reducer so just remember it in that way the first number is always the paint and I've seen people get that backwards and wrong that would cause a major catastrophe because you would have double the error so it's real simple just the first number is always the paint the second number is always the thinner or reduce you now on the future I mixed it one to one or half and half one part future or one part paint and an equal amount of future one to one but don't worry about percentages and all that just think of parts is the easiest way to do it one part is to two parts out or two parts is to one part that makes it a lot easier you're not having to worry about amounts announces and this and that really that's not important you kind of mix by how much paint you think you need to make now you didn't get cups of all different sizes that have these graduations on it and I've seen her people get really messed up on this but this is actually very very simple you know this happens to be a big cup this is a 32 ounce cup and up to here is 24 ounces of paint that's not important these are these are your one your two-part mixing ratio bars here and it makes it really simple if you're mixing one to one you know if you're mixing like I did with the future you know one part paint to one part future or thinner then you would fill the cup up to us just pick a number you know however much paint you think you need say you need about this much paint or somewhere in here and I'll just go to the two so you would fill your paint up to the two on this bar that's your paint bar this is your thinner bar you would leave that paint in there and then fill your reducer up to the two you always match the number you know if you're feeling if you're going to put all the way up to four and paint then you would go all the way up to four leaving that paint in there and add that much reducer you always just match the numbers you don't pour in pain pour it out and then think that's I'm mixing a two to one so I need to fill this two to pour it out and then fill it to one or you don't remove the paint from the bucket you actually fill to a specific number these are just general guide numbers these aren't ounces or nothing these are just numbers that you can match the apparently took depending on how much paint you're willing to mix if you're doing two to one two parts paint to one part thinner or reducer then you again you would just simply fill up to how much you roughly you think you need and I'll say I fill my paint up to three then you would fill continue and fill up to three with reducer and that would give you a two to one or two to one mixture same but four to one you want four parts Hank to one part thinner you would fill to a random number say five then you would put your thinner in leaving that paint in there until you hit the five on the thinner bar and that would give you a four to one ratio mix and it's real simple you get to three parts and it's not much different it's just that you have three components you have a resin or a paint or a clear your second number generally is your hardener because that doesn't change if you're say you're using the matrix clear it's four to one no matter what it's always four parts clear to one part hardener so it would be confusing if you did clear then reduce it and then try to guess what your hardener supposed to be to match to get back to where you're supposed to you know your four to one so I would always I always do it in the way that you mix it this the same is with the two-to-one you I always mix if I'm doing a three-part clear I always makes the clear and the hardener and then reduce it to the consistency that I want so if I want to do a matrix is for two one four two one you know so it'd be four parts clear or four parts paint one part hardener and then if you want to add one part thinner you would go to that line so you would go if you're doing a four one one or let's say you're doing a four one two four parts I'd go to pick a number of just generally how much I'm wanting to end up with you know I want to have maybe this much material when I'm done that's three so I would go to three with the clear leave that in and then fill up this high with hardener and then fill up to here with a reducer and that would give you a 4:1 one or two excuse me ratio and hopefully that's clear I hope I'm making that clear you don't pour in paint and pour it out and then pour in reducer poured out you know nothing like that and you don't get goat-like for one one you know it's not like that you match the numbers across and that gives you that ratio you know it's you would always fill whatever you fill this to you're going to fill your other components to that same number four four four two two two six six six always the same number just remember that same with the two part four four four four four four that's going to give you your different ratios so I hope that that's clear the main thing to remember is when you write down ratios are you telling somebody your ratio or you're reading a ratio it's always paint thinner or paint hardener which is a set you know that's unchangeable or clear hardener thinner you know and just think of it how you an easy way to remembers think of how you mix it you don't typically pour thinner in a bottle and then add paint you always pour your paint and then you add your thinner to the desired consistencies I'm going to put up a video later on hopefully the day of what some pain and stuff and just what I'm doing and I'm kind of think I have an idea of what I'm going to paint the color I've been working so many hours and I'm working two jobs essentially so I haven't been able to do much of anything but anyway hopefully this clears some stuff up talk to y'all later bye", "S4XThrpZeio": "everyone to this video we're gonna make a tiny matchbox suitcase and I thought this would be a cute little suitcase to put some little tiny embellishments in so I shared these embellishments like this cute llama from that mama punch and then we've got that little bunny that Sizzix die i'm here's a little tassel that i made so it can fit all your little embellishments in here some butterflies this is a Sizzix bow and then some sentiments that I put some pop dots in the back and this little house I feisty cut from one of the design papers and then I put a pop dot on the back of that so you could you know give some little tiny embellishments to someone that's a little tiny suitcase and then it just slides in like so and then I added a little tassel to hang on there there's another one so it's really cute I wanted to use up some of my 6x6 paper pads and so that's what inspired me to make this little tiny size okay so let's go ahead and make it I went ahead and precut all the papers so I used the good vibes crepe paper paper pad okay so for the box it's going to be four and a half inches wide by four inches in height and I'll put all the measurements down below so that's the box for the cover it's going to be three and 1/16 wide by five and three-quarter inches in height okay so wide and then height sorry it's five and three-quarters and then the liner for the box is going to be one and three-quarter inches in height and then two and seven-eighths wide and then the handle is going to be half an inch in height and three and a half inches wide okay so let's start with the cover first so for the cover on the three in 1/16 inch side you don't need to do anything but on the five and three-quarter inch side we're going to do some scoring you just turn it over you're going to score it half an inch two and five-eighths 3 and 1/8 and five and a quarter and then we'll just finish those four lines okay and then we'll set that one aside now let's make the box so the Box on the four and a half inches wide side we're going to score at a quarter inch quarter inch three quarters one in a quarter three and a quarter three and three quarters and four and a quarter and then gonna turn to the for each side you're gonna score it half an inch at three and a half okay and then I'm gonna mark it with my pen which ones you're gonna cut out and it's the same on all four sides so you're going to cut the two tabs on all four corners okay so just cut those out this is a you know fun project especially we have collected a ton of 6x6 paper cards and it's a great way to use it okay so on the 4-inch side you're going to cut a slit right here and I cut in an angle it just makes it easier to build the box when you cut the slit just cut a little piece at an angle do the same to all sides okay so you're going to fold in those score lines the quarter inch one you're going to fold back okay so let's just fold those down and then the end piece of quarter-inch one you're going to fold back so we're just going to burnish these real quick okay so what you're going to do is you're going to fold through these little tabs add your glue so here girl pinch hold it down for a few seconds and then you're going to add adhesive to the quarter inch piece so just this end right here just add some glue and Thank You Erica scrappy of a twenty nine for sharing this glue she had sure that she found it at the Dollar Tree store and I was surprised because beacon that's pretty expensive glue if you buy it was at the eight ounce so for what is this ohm 1.75 else it's only a dollar so I thought that was such an amazing deal so Thank You Erica for sharing that okay so there's your box okay and then we got the little box liner piece when I glue that down screw that in there and you can cut this a little bit larger if you want it to fit in the box a little bit more I'm okay with it just being this size okay so you can always change the dimensions to that okay so next we're going to get recover and I start with this piece Wade hall and see how did I do this yeah okay so when you fold this down just keep in mind this is gonna be this is gonna be the front okay the bottom piece right here it's gonna be the front of your suitcase and the reason being is because when we fold this in like this I want the folded end facing front okay so we take that and then I add the glue to this and hold it down like so okay and then there you got your little matchbox a little suitcase now we're gonna make the handle so on the handle on the three-and-a-half inch side we're going to score a half an inch and then at three okay and then I fold it back and then I just do this with my hand do that curl okay you can use your belt folder or if you had that Sizzix curl tool it gives you that because it's such a small piece I just use my hands okay and then you're just going to okay you're going to place it to the edge like so same with this okay and there you have it got your cute little suitcase then you fill it up with some really cute tiny embellishments it you can make and send it out to a crafty friend thanks for watching bye", "5BLR-G98-8Q": "Hey everyone! This is Greg from Chemical Guys, and today I'm gonna show you exactly how to\ndilute your detailing products so you can get the best result on any job. There's two types of products: ready to use and concentrated. A lot of our products at Chemical Guys are\nconcentrated, and that means that they can be diluted. Now, what is dilution? Dilution is taking a product and mixing it\nwith water to water-down the product to get the right\nratio so that it works properly. It's a lot better for you as detailer and\nconsumer because we don't ship you water. We can ship you more product in a smaller bottle, and you can dilute it on the job. Dilution ratio is really complicated for some people, and a lot of people don't understand it. So we spent the time to make this awesome\ndilution ratio chart. This gives you all the dilution ratio measurements\nin ounces for any size container that we sell here at\nChemical Guys. We made one for 16 oz, 32 oz, 1 gallon, and\n5 gallon, and we gave you all the ounce dilution ratios\nfrom 1:1 to 128:1. This is a great tool to help you dilute products\nand make sure you have the right ratio to clean any type\nof job. Dilution ratio can be a little complicated,\nso I'll break it down and show you how it works. Dilution ratios are usually set up with two\nnumbers with a colon (:) in the middle. Those two numbers can be anything from 4:1\nor 64:1. This means that you're mixing, let's say at\n10:1, that's mixing 10 parts water to 1 part product. That bigger number is actually the water, and the smaller number is the amount of product that we're mixing in the bottle. Now every size bottle is different, so you\nneed to do the math to get the right dilution ratio for that size\nbottle. For example, let's dilute a 16 oz bottle 3:1. If you have 16 ounces, use that as the base\nto figure out the calculation. We take our ratio: 3:1, three parts water to one part concentrate, and we add those together. 3 + 1 = 4 Now we take the size of our container, 16 ounces, then divide it by the number that we added\nup together. So that's 16 divided by 4. 16 ounces divided by 4 is 4 ounces. Once we have that number, 4 ounces, that's the number for our \"one\" part. We take our bottle and fill it with 4 ounces\nof our cleaner or detailing product in the bottle. Now to get the ounces for the \"three\" parts, we take 16 ounces (the size of the bottle) and subtract our \"one\" part, which is 4 ounces. 16 - 4 = 12 That 12 ounces is the amount of water we use\nto get the right ratio. 12 + 4 = 16 and that fills up a full 16 ounce bottle. You can do this for any size container, like\na gallon, which is 128 ounces, or 5 gallons, which is 640 ounces. You can use this for any size container, but we set up our chart with the 4 bottle\nsizes that we sell at Chemical Guys. If math is a hard subject for you, you can easily use the chart by finding the\nnumber you want to place the dilution ratio at. So in a 16 oz. bottle at 8:1, you add 1.8 oz of product to 14.2 oz of water. It's super easy to do, and it makes diluting\nany product quick and easy. I'm gonna show you how to dilute the product\nin a bottle. We're gonna use a 3:1 ratio of AllClean in\nthis 16 oz bottle. Dilution ratios can be done in any type of\nratio. We give recommendations for specific product\ndilutions, So if you want to dilute your product 10:1,\nyou can easily do that. If you want to dilute it 4:1, you can do that\ntoo. You can even adjust your dilution ratio for\nthe job at hand. If I'm using AllClean here with a 10:1 or\n20:1 suggested dilution ratio, I can use it to clean something dirtier with\na dilution ratio of 3:1 for more cleaning power. I have an empty 16 oz. bottle here fitted\nwith the Perfect Pour EZ Fill Funnel. I'll screw the funnel on so I don't spill\nany product, and dilute it 3:1. So let's add the two ratio numbers: 3 + 1 = 4 so I'm gonna do this in quarters. I'll fill the bottle up a quarter of the way\nwith AllClean. That's about a quarter.. then I'll take my water--this is regular distilled\nwater, and dilute my product with the other three\nparts. This gives me a good ratio of 3:1. You notice I didn't spill any product because\nof my Perfect Pour Funnel, and I can fill it up right to the top for\nthe right dilution. Now our product is ready to go. I only have to add a sprayer, and then I'm ready to go detailing!

recipe in the description box for you it's the same one that i use just with smaller measurements because nobody needs as much hot cocoa as i made that was silly my husband's like what in the world are you doing but i have given a lot of it away so if you want to make a lot to give away you know as gifts or whatever or just to hand out to people during when during the cold weather um just double the recipe because that's essentially what i did and so i'll be back in one second to share with you how i'm sending these out be right back all right everyone this is the first one that i'm going to share with you and these are just plastic containers that i got from amazon i will link them in the description box for you i um share some meals with some of the elderly in our church when i cook for us i just share with them some of what we have and they eat like good teeny birds so this is a small container like this is way more than they normally eat but this is the smallest size i could get i believe this one is eight ounces i'm not exactly sure then there's a 16 and a 32 ounce container that they come in i also used a 16 ounce container and set that to the police station so if you're going to share with a group of people you may want to purchase the larger containers and then i didn't use the 32 ounce one because this this is really a lot of hot cocoa mix and so what i did was i went to my publisher on my computer and i downloaded some of my i transferred some of my images from nitwit collections that i own and just made them into a circle and they had a circle on my on my program so i could make sure everything fit inside that circle and this is this lid i believe is a four inch i used a four inch circle and then i used one of my die cuts to cut it out and it has here the hot cocoa mix and two heaping teaspoons to one cup of hot water one caught like a coffee mug type of hot water and this is the first one that i made here is the second one and they all have the directions written right on them let me zoom out here a little bit so i can share some more of them with you and here is the third one and the fourth one i absolutely love i love nitwit collections and all of these came from different well these two came from the same set and then these are from different sets and they have all kinds they just came out with a nutcracker set that i want and will probably be buying but when i buy them i'm going to tell you i do not buy the seven dollar seventeen dollar set i mean it has everything in it i don't use the letters you know i don't you know i stick with i think it's like seven dollars for what i get i mean it's not expensive at all 779 is the nitwit collection that i'm going to purchase so it's not expensive at all and they've got a muay christmas collection that i'm also going to purchase and right now it's only three dollars and 49 cents and it comes with four different towels some buttons some background papers because all of these background papers came from the sets as well i mean everything and i just printed them out on my printer with some cardstock and i used the inexpensive cardstock that you can get from walmart super easy and it's got the directions there's a ton of hot cocoa in here and so it's just a perfect amount to give to them it will last them all winter you know because i mean they don't you know they don't drink a lot of hot cocoa but if they do and they want more i can just fill them up and that's exactly what i told the police department if you want more once you're done with this send the thing home with jessie i will fill it up again and send it back and these ladies always send me back their tubs because they know i refill them so i will get these back eventually but if i don't it's not a big deal these these containers are not expensive but this is one way that i'm sharing my hot cocoa and if you give me one second i'll be back and show you another way that i'm sharing it and this way um i was gifted these bags that someone had purchased for a candy buffet they had set up at a wedding so i was purchased these but i'm sure you could get something like them at clearbags.com and i will try to link that for you in the description as well and i purchased from them in the past they are an awesome company i'll be right back in one second to share the next idea all right everyone this is my next idea for sharing this and my husband is actually going to take this one and give it to a lady that he works with in the office one there the one lady in the office there's only one and um so i just used it to fill it up with hot coffee and it's got the top like um like if you buy bags for coffee that's what it's like and it just folds down and rolls and then hooks in the back and i will share that with you but all i did was i cut out i used my cottage cuts dies and i cut out a circle here for the little image which says hot cocoa add two heaping teaspoons to one cup of hot water and then i did a scallop circle i'll zoom in a little tighter there and i did a scallop circle for the background and of course all of the papers again come from the knitwick collections and then i just added a little charm of a candy cane since he's hanging from a candy cane i thought that would be cute now i purchased this charm several years ago from dee who is elegant embellishments i don't know that she's going to carry them again or what she's even doing with her store because i know that she um has moved so i'm not sure if she's doing it i did find them on other places but you had to purchase them in a large quantity so if you know if you just google it in either aliexpress or wish or one of these places i'm sure they'll come up and they may have them in smaller quantities on aliexpress but the place i found had them in large quantities which was way more than i wanted and i can't even remember where i got them from or you know where i saw them at but i loved it i tied it on with a little bit of twine i poked a hole now this was my this was my boo-boo don't do this i poked a hole right here now of course you can still pour it out this side and you're fine or you roll it down and you get your spoonful that was a big boo because now there's a hole in the bag the smart thing to do would have been to use my crocodile and punch a hole in this plastic piece and then the plastic piece would be over here it would be out of the way and it wouldn't matter if there was a hole in the plastic piece but i punched it all the way through the roll on the bag so that was not one of my brighter moves definitely not one of my greater moves and uh but you know it will still work because you use a spoon you reach under the spoon get it out i don't think the hole is going to be a problem and the amount is below the hole so i mean it's not a super huge mistake but it's still one i'm not real thrilled with so i will probably change out the bag before i send it to um to my husband's co-worker and uh so that it you know doesn't look like it has a hole in the bag i'm just like i did it this morning my son asked me to get up and go to walmart at some crazy ridiculous hour to try to get some gaming system that they ended up not even having until tomorrow so i am like super tired and so punch drunk i'm just like i can't even think straight i think my eyes are rolling around i'm not even focusing but uh so that explains the hole in the bag if i had been thinking with my wits this morning when i did when i finished it up i would have punched the hole in the little me and the little flappy piece the plastic piece so do that don't punch a hole all the way through the bag and i'll be back in one second to share them with you again so in case you have any questions you can see them good again real good hold on one sec all right everyone here they are again again i punch this into a four inch circle that's what size it took to cover this lid but you know if you use you know you can use recyclable you know plastic containers with lids and just measure it and cut out your circle and adjust it to whatever size container that you're using but i will link these because they're great we my family uses the larger ones for leftovers and like i said the medium and the small ones we use to share i put food in for the elderly so i mean there's there there's a lot of great things you can use them for you could use them in your craft space because they're really handy things and they stack great so but i wanted to share those with you if you have any questions or comments leave them below i will try to link the um each of the collections as well from the nitwit collection so that you can go and purchase any if you're interested i know a lot of people love gingers and there's some really cute ones in this collection but this little santa with his wiry arms and legs for some reason cracks me up and mr and mrs claus came together but they also came separate in this set along with the sleigh being separate so these are all individual pieces that i lined up together and that is it this is the last way that i will probably i sent um hot cocoa and canisters that said coco on the front i found them at walmart i have a video that i will put up probably before this one and i went to the store today like i said i had to be there to try to get this crazy game for my son and um they were out of those red cocoa canisters already at my walmart but my walmart is teeny tiny doesn't get a lot of stuff so you guys still may be able to get them if you're interested in that one and i will link that video um and then just at the end of this one so that you can see it and that's it guys i will be back soon with some more videos if you like this video give it a thumbs up if you have any questions or comments leave them below and i'll do my best to answer them and remember to practice your cpr craft pray repeat thanks for visiting me today and

grams in an ounce okay actually already uncensored well here's the answer okay for everyone's pounds how many grams do you get okay hist equation is answer so one ounce is equal to twenty eight point three four nine five grams well let's make a question and answer it so maybe it will help us to remember that question or health hey here's an example question oh man how much is how many how much is ten ounce okay okay let's answer the question so the first thing that I need to do is to put ten you'll find it from here and multiply it with one ounce because this is amps okay and then you put it equal sign and then how much scrums that because you have ten your life must have two in the right as well okay thirty ten and we multiplied it with the basic formula just like we do with this one okay we do just the same okay tamp apply wait the number okay now to apply once equal to tan tan hours is equal to two 83.4 I'm sorry for 9.5 gram well that sounds of the question if you have any

drive. Getting the engine running was a big\u00a0\u00a0 step in that direction but there are some loose\u00a0\nends to tie up and we need to install the thing.\u00a0\u00a0 So sit back, relax, and watch to see if pulling an\u00a0\nall-nighter will be enough to get this bus rolling\u00a0\u00a0 under its own power. I've had a few opportunities\u00a0\nover the last several days to come out and do a\u00a0\u00a0 few cold starts with the engine and it's revealed\u00a0\njust a couple of things. Overall it looks pretty\u00a0\u00a0 good. The biggest thing was totally my fault- I\u00a0\ndidn't tighten down one of the jam nuts enough\u00a0\u00a0 on one of the rockers here, I guess\u00a0\nthat would have been number three\u00a0\u00a0 intake. It actually came all the way off and when\u00a0\nI pulled the valve cover off, it was sitting in\u00a0\u00a0 the bottom of the valve cover. So kind of\u00a0\na spooky moment but it sure did explain the\u00a0\u00a0 sound I was hearing. So I got that situated and\u00a0\ntightened down, actually redid all the valves\u00a0\u00a0 and re-tightened all of the jam nuts just to\u00a0\nbe sure. And of course I'm always listening for\u00a0\u00a0 that to happen again for a while. Also found that\u00a0\nthis cover on the accelerator pump was a little\u00a0\u00a0 bit loose, so when the accelerator was operating\u00a0\nthere was a little bit of fuel squirted out here\u00a0\u00a0 and because the fuel was going that way instead\u00a0\nof down into the intake, there was a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 of a stumble right off of idle because it wasn't\u00a0\ngetting the full shot of fuel that it needed. So\u00a0\u00a0 got that tightened up and that seems to have gone\u00a0\naway. Now there's one last thing that needs to be\u00a0\u00a0 addressed and that's this little cam here.\u00a0\nThe \"fast idle cam\". There's a pin over here\u00a0\u00a0 that is kind of a limit pin on this end of\u00a0\nit. It's nice and loose and it moves freely\u00a0\u00a0 which is you know what's supposed to happen\u00a0\nbut check that out- it just kind of stops\u00a0\u00a0 on its own. Lubrication is not the issue,\u00a0\nthere's an alignment issue. It's rubbing up\u00a0\u00a0 against that pin a little bit on the left-hand\u00a0\nside of the opening and it continues to feel\u00a0\u00a0 that way all the way down. So I think a couple of\u00a0\nminutes with the Dremel is going to solve this,\u00a0\u00a0 so let's get this thing off and modify it a\u00a0\nlittle bit and then we'll crank the engine\u00a0\u00a0 again and see where we are. Let's do a test fit.\u00a0\nThe Dremel raised the slightest burr back here so\u00a0\u00a0 I sanded that off. I don't want that to dig into\u00a0\nanything here. I want this to move nice and easy.\u00a0\u00a0 Okay I think that's what we want.\u00a0\nOkay now I think we're in good shape and we have probably squirted a pile\u00a0\nof fuel down the throat of the carb. I just shut the engine off and I'm going to let it\u00a0\nsit for about 20 minutes before I try it again. I\u00a0\u00a0 want to take a few temperature readings here. This\u00a0\nis the carb, the venturi area of the carb and it's\u00a0\u00a0 93 or so degrees. I expect that may\u00a0\nwarm up a bit. Down here the case 151,\u00a0\u00a0 150 or so. So this is all going to equalize\u00a0\nwhile it sits. Something we call heat soak. We'll see how it starts once all this has\u00a0\nhad an opportunity to soak a little bit.\u00a0\u00a0 I'll take it. I've run out of things to check and mess around\u00a0\nwith. The engine's fine. It's ready to go which\u00a0\u00a0 is pretty awesome. So there's a list of things\u00a0\nto do before and after installing the engine that\u00a0\u00a0 leads up of course to a test drive which will\u00a0\nbe awesome. So I'm going to move on to those\u00a0\u00a0 things. I think the engine's in great shape. It\u00a0\ndid smoke a little bit on deceleration once it was\u00a0\u00a0 fully warmed up but that may be some of the stuff\u00a0\nblowing out. There was some carbon and so on in\u00a0\u00a0 there and I had soaked the cylinders pretty good\u00a0\nwith Marvel Mystery Oil and that might have made\u00a0\u00a0 its way through because I don't see that smoke\u00a0\nanymore. The real test will be when it's under\u00a0\u00a0 load. That's when it'll actually get hot, right?\u00a0\nI've warmed it up but there's no load. It's just\u00a0\u00a0 sitting there idling or just spinning at whatever\u00a0\nrpm and that's not the kind of work that it's\u00a0\u00a0 going to be doing when it's pushing this heavy\u00a0\nbus around so that's going to be the real test.\u00a0\u00a0 I think that's next so we're in great shape. We've\u00a0\ngot a running engine that's nice and quiet. I\u00a0\u00a0 don't hear awful noises coming out of it. I don't\u00a0\nsee smoke coming out of it. It cranks real easy, settles right into a nice\u00a0\nidle. Nothing seems too hot.\u00a0\u00a0 I don't know, I couldn't be happier at\u00a0\nthis stage so let's uh let's move on then.\u00a0\u00a0 I have mostly refurbed the air filter. The\u00a0\nbase has gotten the same treatment except\u00a0\u00a0 this got soaked in kerosene. There's all those\u00a0\nfibers in there that you can't really get to\u00a0\u00a0 without destroying the thing but you can soak\u00a0\nit in kerosene and then it needs to be soaked in\u00a0\u00a0 oil so they actually catch crud as the air\u00a0\npasses through. So I'm going to cut down this\u00a0\u00a0 milk carton here and saturate this for a day or so\u00a0\nand then I'll let it drain for a long time. I'm so\u00a0\u00a0 close to getting this thing on the road, I think\u00a0\nif I push through a little bit here I might be\u00a0\u00a0 able to do a midnight test drive. We do have\u00a0\nsome electrical work to do in the engine bay\u00a0\u00a0 so we've got to knock that out. I forgot to\u00a0\nput the seal that goes back here so I'm going\u00a0\u00a0 to mess with this a little bit and get the seals\u00a0\nright. I mean all this work on the cooling tin\u00a0\u00a0 was for a reason and I want to make sure I\u00a0\nget it right back here. So we're going to do\u00a0\u00a0 that. We're going to pull the blower off.\u00a0\nNeed to top up the reduction gear boxes,\u00a0\u00a0 cinch down the axle boots. Need to do something\u00a0\nwith the accelerator. Need to do something with\u00a0\u00a0 the bowden tube. Ah we just got stuff to do so\u00a0\nwe're going to start knocking them off the list\u00a0\u00a0 and once we're done we'll do a test drive in\u00a0\nthe middle of the night and once that's over\u00a0\u00a0 we'll go to bed and wake up and edit a bunch\u00a0\nof video. Sound like a plan? So let's do it!\u00a0\u00a0 If you want to be in the garage, that's where\u00a0\nyou should be and the other stuff you can figure\u00a0\u00a0 out as you go. Let's make good on that promise to\u00a0\nourselves and maybe have a big payoff at the end.\u00a0\u00a0 This will be neat. One thing that'll\u00a0\nhave to come off is the generator.\u00a0\u00a0 One of our items on the to-do list is to\u00a0\nremake these wires so we'll make a good set. I've pulled the gauge wire and the idiot\u00a0\nlight wire off of the oil pressure sender.\u00a0\u00a0 I do need to pull this hot wire off the coil. I\u00a0\u00a0 don't think I'm going to test run this\u00a0\nthing again until it's in the vehicle. Oops take off this hot wire.\u00a0\nOops take off this ground wire. Okay, did we make it? Yay we made it! What do I do with this? So here's the plan. The opening in the housing is\u00a0\ntwo and three quarter inches wide. This oil cooler\u00a0\u00a0 is two inches wide, so I have three fourths of\u00a0\nan inch that need to be filled up with gasket\u00a0\u00a0 or weather stripping. So I've got a half inch\u00a0\non this side, that leaves a quarter inch on the\u00a0\u00a0 other side. This weather stripping happens\u00a0\nto be a quarter of an inch so I'm going to\u00a0\u00a0 hold it in place with some very high bond tape\u00a0\nand I'll put two layers of this up this side\u00a0\u00a0 and one layer of this on the back side. Maybe one\u00a0\nlayer to that, one layer there and then one layer\u00a0\u00a0 across all of it. That'll look kind of nice.\u00a0\nAll right let's do that. Seems simple enough. So hopefully we don't scrape all of this back\u00a0\noff again by putting the housing in place.\u00a0\u00a0 That'd be a bad deal. All right that should be a\u00a0\nnice tight seal. That's good. Okay, on to the next thing. Let's knock\u00a0\nout the accelerator pivot thingy thing. As you may recall we have a little bit of a unique\u00a0\narrangement using some standard hardware here.\u00a0\u00a0 I think this is how it goes. It does appear\u00a0\nto line up nice with my accelerator pedal.\u00a0\u00a0 Goes through the hole pretty much in the\u00a0\ncenter so I'm going to take that. I want\u00a0\u00a0 to lube all this stuff a little bit\u00a0\nbut I think I'm going to go with that. Okay, we're gonna go up there and install the boot\u00a0\u00a0 and then get the little clippy clip\u00a0\ninvolved with the accelerator pedal. Okay, took some finagling\u00a0\nbut we've got it on there\u00a0\u00a0 and everything seems to work smooth so we're good. Just want to fill it up to a\u00a0\nlittle line in the bottom there. Okay, air filter is ready. Seems like a\u00a0\nlong time ago that I forgot to put this\u00a0\u00a0 on the bowden tube so let's do it now. Okay, let's go with that. We're going to\u00a0\nprepare the tank for installation and go\u00a0\u00a0 ahead and get it put in place. I want\u00a0\nto make sure that this surface is nice\u00a0\u00a0 and clean. It's the aluminum crush\u00a0\nwasher that goes up against this. This sock goes in there and that's a crush washer\u00a0\nthat's on the end of that sock. So that's supposed\u00a0\u00a0 to seal it here, then there is this little\u00a0\nfiber washer that seals the sock to this thing\u00a0\u00a0 that goes through there. So I'll install all of\u00a0\nthis once the tank is in place. What I do want to\u00a0\u00a0 install right now is the sender, so let's flip\u00a0\nthe tank over and get this thing put in place.\u00a0\u00a0 I got a new gasket for the cap. Let's go ahead\u00a0\nand get that in there too. this guy's pretty dry. Nice. I want to clean those threads out.\u00a0\nThere might be a little bit of rust and a\u00a0\u00a0 little bit of paint maybe so I'll just\u00a0\nrun these through a couple of times.\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah those are shiny now so that's what I want.\u00a0\nI'll do these others just to cover them all. I'll put the ground wire right here. Here's the ground wire We have our tank to body gasket here. That is\u00a0\nprobably going to get totally dislodged throughout\u00a0\u00a0 this process but we'll start it where we want\u00a0\nit. I think I want to go in that way and then\u00a0\u00a0 see if I can come around this way. Just a little\u00a0\nbit of finagling. Hey, that wasn't bad at all.\u00a0\u00a0 The key was getting the neck of the\u00a0\ntank all the way up into this hole\u00a0\u00a0 before trying to rotate the rest of the tank\u00a0\ninto place. But that did the trick. The body\u00a0\u00a0 to tank seal even looks like it's in place.\u00a0\nSome may wonder why I don't use a fuel filter,\u00a0\u00a0 like a visible one elsewhere in the line-\u00a0\nparticularly between the fuel pump and the carb.\u00a0\u00a0 This is why everything past this point should\u00a0\nbe in good shape. If not, I should replace it.\u00a0\u00a0 So this is the fuel filter on this bus.\u00a0\nI don't like the idea of a filter between\u00a0\u00a0 the pump and the carb because while it's still\u00a0\nlow pressure that's still the pressurized line\u00a0\u00a0 and I'd hate for it to push that filter off or if\u00a0\nthe filter breaks (they are cheap plastic things),\u00a0\u00a0 if that breaks we've got a problem. Also, it adds\u00a0\na little bit of weight because it does mostly fill\u00a0\u00a0 up with fuel and I think that's hard on the fuel\u00a0\ninlet on the carb. So this is the fuel filter.\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah ran into a little bit of a problem. This ear\u00a0\nbroke off of the starter as I was removing it from\u00a0\u00a0 the test stand. This is the starter that I\u00a0\nhave for this. Obviously I'm in the market\u00a0\u00a0 for a new one but I'd love to make a run tonight.\u00a0\nSo let's see. Let's just see if it'll work. We'll\u00a0\u00a0 go ahead and plug it in and then I can start\u00a0\nlooking for a replacement. That's a shame.\u00a0\u00a0 Everything else about it is just fine except\u00a0\nthis little ear broke off. So what a shame.\u00a0\u00a0 All right, let's get it plugged in.\u00a0\u00a0 I'll go ahead and put this in here\u00a0\nmaybe this will take up some slack. Awesome Okay, won't really know until the engine's\u00a0\nin and we're able to tighten down this bolt\u00a0\u00a0 but let's give it a shot. There's an arrangement\u00a0\non this power cable here that's a little confusing\u00a0\u00a0 to me. This is the correct terminal for a hot.\u00a0\nIt's not, you know, one of those clamp dealies.\u00a0\u00a0 So it's a good one and it has a power lead\u00a0\ncoming out of it but for whatever reason\u00a0\u00a0 there's nothing going on here and they have\u00a0\nthe power lead kind of rigged together here.\u00a0\u00a0 So I think what I'll do is modify\u00a0\nthis to put this power lead\u00a0\u00a0 on this wire. For starters (see what I\u00a0\ndid there?) I need to get rid of that. So this is the hot wire that goes to the\u00a0\nbattery terminal on the regulator. We're\u00a0\u00a0 going to replace this. Okay while we're\u00a0\nover here let's make a little adapter to\u00a0\u00a0 go from the spade lug terminal on the oil\u00a0\npressure sender over to a ring terminal. Okay we'll come back to that when we\u00a0\nneed it. Let's install this power cable. That does not look like a\u00a0\nvery effective ground to me. Now it's a little better. I'm going to take the\u00a0\nopportunity to put in a new regulator and just\u00a0\u00a0 carry the old one as a spare. So I've got this\u00a0\nall cleaned up and a little bit of dielectric goo\u00a0\u00a0 on there. This thing has to be grounded after all.\u00a0\nOkay, this is for our generator light. This will\u00a0\u00a0 tell us if our fan belt broke. This is our battery\u00a0\nwire. I'd like that to be a little tighter. All right, we've got our coil wire and our\u00a0\noil pressure wires here so these will stand by\u00a0\u00a0 waiting for the engine.\u00a0\u00a0 Okay, now we need a ground\u00a0\nwire. Based on these wires,\u00a0\u00a0 I'm betting the lights kind of stink and\u00a0\nwhatever they start off as they can be improved. All right, things are looking good. What's next? Well this is getting pretty exciting. We're\u00a0\ngonna go ahead and put the engine on the ATV\u00a0\u00a0 jack and install the thing, then we'll have a\u00a0\nfew more things to do but this is pretty cool. So this 5/16 inch fuel line looks like it\u00a0\nmay work kind of sort of okay. We'll try it.\u00a0\u00a0 It's going to be snug which is kind of what we\u00a0\nwant. This is the hole for the fuel line. I have a\u00a0\u00a0 grommet for that. Fuel line on these things is not\u00a0\nsomething that we want to play around with. But\u00a0\u00a0 actually, that's going to cramp the style of this\u00a0\ngrommet. I'm going to trim that so it doesn't.\u00a0\u00a0 See if that does the trick. Looks nice.\u00a0\u00a0 As long as this holds we'll be okay. It is almost 2AM and the engine is in. I'm not\u00a0\nsure if that means we're making good time or\u00a0\u00a0 what but I'm still having fun. I've been wanting\u00a0\nto do an all-nighter like this for a while so what\u00a0\u00a0 better occasion than to try and do a test drive in\u00a0\nthe bus. So we're going to keep on going. We got a\u00a0\u00a0 handful more things to do. Need to make some wires\u00a0\nfor the generator. The plus wire and the field\u00a0\u00a0 wire. So I have the terminals that I need here.\u00a0\nLet's go ahead and get this thing put together.\u00a0\u00a0 We're going to make these wires just\u00a0\na little bigger and a little longer.\u00a0\u00a0 Give better routing options a little\u00a0\nbit of margin of safety there. Okay, for the field wire we're going to put\u00a0\na spade lug on one end and a ring terminal on\u00a0\u00a0 the other. This is 12 gauge. I'm pretty\u00a0\nsure that 14 gauge would have been just\u00a0\u00a0 fine but we'll go with it. I'm out of black\u00a0\nheat shrink so I'll just use this yeller. Okay I found these little boots that slip over\u00a0\nthese posts on the generator. These are\u00a0\u00a0 stock things that I hadn't actually seen them\u00a0\nbefore so I was pretty pleased to find these. Isn't that cute? Like it was made to be\u00a0\nthere. I'm gonna snake these back here.\u00a0\u00a0 Okay, here's our coil positive. This is\u00a0\nour oil pressure. All I get to do right now\u00a0\u00a0 is have the idiot light. I'll have to run a wire\u00a0\nfor the gauge but for now this will be fine.\u00a0\u00a0 I need to make a metal fuel line so\u00a0\nI'm going to use this coat hanger\u00a0\u00a0 because I think that'll work okay. Ah but\u00a0\nseriously, folks... going to use this metal coat\u00a0\u00a0 hanger to make a pattern for a metal fuel line.\u00a0\nBack here on the other side of the firewall tin\u00a0\u00a0 where the fuel line goes right over the exhaust\u00a0\nfor number three, that's a lot of heat there\u00a0\u00a0 so I want the metal fuel line for that and then\u00a0\nto reach over to the outlet. But I need to bend\u00a0\u00a0 it in such a way that it can be put in and removed\u00a0\nand put in removed without a lot of hassle, right?\u00a0\u00a0 Okay, we start there at the fuel\u00a0\ninlet, goes behind, if you can follow,\u00a0\u00a0 comes around here, where it comes out we are right\u00a0\nabove the exhaust which is crazy. We want to go up\u00a0\u00a0 and hit those clips. We definitely want to go\u00a0\nup and away from this. Okay, this looks good.\u00a0\u00a0 Let's see if we can make a metal line that pretty\u00a0\nmuch does this. This is the fuel inlet, comes\u00a0\u00a0 around the blower housing, through the grommet and\u00a0\nthen comes over towards the outlet of the tank. Okay that looks comfy. Comes\u00a0\naround the blower housing\u00a0\u00a0 and up to the inlet. So I'm going to\u00a0\nshorten it back to about right here.\u00a0\u00a0 I think I'll mark that and I'll shorten about this\u00a0\nmuch off of the other end. I think we'll be ready. This is starting to get kind of serious\u00a0\nfolks. Okay, hopefully nothing melts. Cool. Okay. It's late. I've got to do one more thing, and\u00a0\nI really wish I didn't have to do this but\u00a0\u00a0 I have to top up the reduction gear boxes\u00a0\nand I can't get to the plug with this,\u00a0\u00a0 with the wheels on. I'm gonna have to take the\u00a0\nwheels off. I've got them torqued, hubcaps on,\u00a0\u00a0 everything. But I gotta take them off. It's gonna\u00a0\nbe real neat and we're real close but I'm gonna do\u00a0\u00a0 this one more thing and then take another look at\u00a0\nmy list make sure I haven't forgotten anything and\u00a0\u00a0 then we'll see if it'll fire up and maybe do a lap\u00a0\naround the neighborhood before the sun comes up. It's been fun. Okay one more thing. It's 10 till 5. I think I'm ready to go. So, topped off the reduction gear boxes, have the\u00a0\nwheels back on, torqued properly, ready to go.\u00a0\u00a0 I think the engine is buttoned up. I believe\u00a0\nI've hooked up all of the electrical.\u00a0\u00a0 I know it has a little bit of\u00a0\nfuel. I'm going to crank it\u00a0\u00a0 and if there's no leaks I'll add a little more\u00a0\nfuel. I'm ready to go. Here's a finishing touch. Okay, let's see if she'll\u00a0\ncrank let's see if she'll go. Got lights... Might have flooded it a little. Went into gear. Brakes feel okay. Shifts good. Feels like a VW. I guess\u00a0\nI need to clean this windshield. Boy it's fun to drive. Okay, I think it's time\u00a0\nto take it back to the shop and see if anything\u00a0\u00a0 has changed or anything has developed.\u00a0\nDo a post-mortem here on the test drive. Now we did it. We got the thing\u00a0\nrunning and driving and stopping. We did it. Let's go look at the engine. No oil light, so that's good. Okay, that's a wrap. 504(AM). All right. Yeah, time to\u00a0\ntake a shower and get some rest\u00a0\u00a0 but cool. Check it out folks, we did it! Now I'm not going to say it's on the\u00a0\nroad. It's running, driving, and stopping\u00a0\u00a0 and it seems on its way to being on\u00a0\nthe road but we're not there yet.\u00a0\u00a0 We need to get this thing totally road worthy.\u00a0\nAll the way buttoned up. I don't want to drive\u00a0\u00a0 it like this. You know, check a bunch of\u00a0\nstuff. I want to adjust the brakes, maybe\u00a0\u00a0 maybe after a couple more test drives. Yeah,\u00a0\nso we got some more stuff to suss out here\u00a0\u00a0 but no real problems came up in that drive.\u00a0\nWe just confirmed a lot of our efforts worked.\u00a0\u00a0 So, very cool. Yeah, got to be happy about that.\u00a0\nAlso going to be happy about a little bit of rest.\u00a0\u00a0 All right, thanks for watching\u00a0\ny'all. We'll see you next time.", "xLZCcCC26J4": "I thought I'd just explained eighths of an inch for any of you that don't know out there no this is using the metric system I'm in Canada and the well they use the metric system but the imperial system you know is your inch foot and that type of thing you know in construction we still use that we don't we don't measure something and say that it's eight hundred and fifty thousand millimeters or what have you you know you just say something is six foot two or but what have you so I want to just explain I've been in the trades for over twenty years and I do drywall boarding and taping or plastering and some people call it and so when I treat my helpers to figure out how we use your cut drywall to the eighth of an inch so two and an eighth or two and five eighths two and seven eighths that type of thing so we're always dealing with an eighth of an inch so I won't just want to give a little tip if you want to say if you're not familiar with your eighths of an inch this is the easiest way to remember so when this is 1 this is how we explain it to all my helpers okay so we're just going to look at between the 3 and the 4 here just so that it's um it's easier to see than starting at you know 0 and 1 right so we're just going to go between 3 & 4 now on now if you look here at the beginning of the inch we'll call that zero and then so 3 is zero and four will be one inch in between there so the halfway point is obviously obviously a half inch then when we divide the house in half we got a quarter inch so if you remember money that's easy to remember is that we got 1/4 1/2 3/4 and then 1 or one dollar so to say so um providing that you're from Canada or the States I don't know how pounds work and and that type of thing but um the easiest way to figure out an eighth of an inch first of all there's eight eighths in one inch so if you can remember your odd numbers that is the easiest way remember your eights so from 0 to 8 think of your olive numbers which is 1 3 5 and 7 so all the halfway points between the arm so between 0 and 1/4 inch that is 1/8 of an inch from here to here so it's actually done we have the the longest tip here this one is like the one inch mark the smoke the shorter one is the half inch mark this mark and this mark are even shorter those are your quarter inch marks and then the next smallest the next smallest one those are all your eighths of an inch so there there there and there so if you could start from zero and go to eight think of your odd numbers which is one three five and seven you know it's easy to know two four six eight but the one three five and seven is a way to remember your eighths of an inch so at the beginning we have one eight the next one is 3/8 5/8 and 7/8 seven eighths is obviously closer at the end 1/8 is close to the beginning so 3 and 5 are the ones that you need to UM to remember so memory odd numbers 1 3 5 & 7 those will give your eights of an inch now on on this disk measuring on this ruler here these every little tiny tick there's actually 16 ticks between 0 & 1 inch is 16 so the first little line is 1/16 of an inch then we got 2 16 3 16 4 16 v 16 7/16 on and on and on again if you remember your odd numbers from 0 to 16 all those 16 all those odd numbers are going to be your 16s so we got 1 16 3 5 7 9 11 13 and 15 and those are all your 7 7 eighths so you know if if someone says I need a 3/8 drill bit or a hole that's 3/8 of an inch this may help you with measuring you know if you already know this great but I've worked with draw Waller's that have been hanging drywall for like ten years and they don't know they're eighths of an inch and they work in the trade and get paid good money and they don't know they're eighths of an inch so I usually when I hire someone I say hey go cut me a piece of drywall four and three eighths and if they can't figure out where four and three-eighths is on a tape measure and they don't have a job much longer so so I just thought I would explain that real quick take them on my practical experience and maybe they'll help you you know but the one thing that I've started doing lately is is actually using millimeters with some things when it's really really detailed things then I might use millimeters to measure things", "lbvgd_P1Lf8": "[Music] hey youtube what's going on this is liberty coins coming at you on thursday march 18 2021 silver stacking box roll fine we're looking for silver half dollars silver proofs and proofs all right everybody this is our 50 box half dollar marathon this is part one this is boxes one through ten we're gonna get right to it we're gonna start with the top right hand box and work our way over to the left we have 49 loomis boxes and one burns box we're gonna start with the brinks box and then when i find anything i'll bring it back in hang tight all right let's go all right let's see what we got all right i don't see any visible enders because i don't check for enders but oh look at this actually this is not even uh these aren't even brinks these are the nf string and sons these are the harrisburg pennsylvania ones that you see a lot like coin world fishing has so this is not even a brinks all right so we're gonna get to it when i find anything i'll let you know on the nf string and sun box box one all right we got our first proof of the hunt [Music] a 2005 proof all right let's keep going all right that was it for the first box we got the proof let's go on to box number two all right for box two we were skunked let's go on to box number three all right box three was a skunk let's go on to box number four all right box four no enders little broken roll there i forgot to do something before i started my video gotta shake the liberty globe wish me luck i didn't even do that so see what happens when you're all giddy all right let's get going box four uh not a silver but i think we got one of those gold clad i'll just put it under my unique ah vho okay pretty neat uh box number four there's anything else here yeah now we're good all right one roll left let's just do it live what the heck what that nope nothing else all right that was it for box number four everybody let's go into box number five all right just open up box five we've got a another other unique ender here we'll put it back where it was oh another one of those commemorative stickers uh admiral nimitz world war ii all right i'll stick this guy back where he was and we'll open it when we get to it live and then this little orange one but all right we're gonna start our way and zigzag all right we found nothing up to the sticker coin so let's open the sticker coin up live [Music] not seeing anything else in it so yep so here it is just uh chester w nimitz i found one of these before already sticker coin all right let's keep going all right nothing else for box number five let's go on to box number six all right box number six was a skunk let's go into box number seven all right nothing for box number seven we were skunked let's go on to box number eight all right box number eight we were skunked let's go into box number nine all right box nine we're skunked onto our final box box number ten all right youtube box 10 and i'm excited we have an ender not one but we have two enders i just opened the box we have one right here and we have one up here and we'll open them when we get to them but this one looks like looks like a 1969 40 percenter this one i saw boom sticks right out look at that probably oh yeah it's a 64. so we're gonna have some silver today folks i'm gonna put her right back in the box all is not lost for liberty coins okay we'll start this way go down and when i find anything i'll let you know when i and then i'll do these live when i get to them all right let's go okay the very first roll i feel good i really feel good a 1967 a 40 percenter and let's make sure there's nothing else oh we got another one in the very no no that's it okay so let's just open up the next one whenever i find one i'm just going to open up the next one because last couple videos i've done i would say the very next roll oh my god holy cow there's one two three and there's an ender which was a four let me let's see wow what do we got 1968 that's a d next one oh my god 1968 d all right um i'm losing it in the light here oh an ender 1969 a 40 percenter i didn't even catch that because that's a down ender holy smokes oh another one four in the roll 1967. see let me just double check again okay that's awesome let's do the very next roll got to be kidding me that's awesome [Music] all right nothing all right when i find anything i'll let you know all right couple rows later there's just the one right there oh a 90 percenter a 1964 that's awesome that's um six for the box and i have two enders so that's seven at least all right let's open up the next roll we're gonna keep our luck going keep it live oh man all right nothing else can i bring something else i'll let you know two rolls later we've got three one two and three not that dark one so let's just check it out oh that's awesome 1969. this one

right let's just do the next roll which is the ender we know it's a 1969 holy crap everybody now we're piling it on this is awesome all right so nothing in the roll just the ender which was a 1969 d a 40 percenter all right that's five let's just check the next one [Music] oh dirty look at that and there's nothing in that roll all right when i find something else i'll let you know next very next roll down and i think we've got a silver there's a bunch of crap that fell out of it yeah 1964. another 90 that's a philadelphia all right let's grab the next one this is awesome now this is great there's one in the roll i'm glad i'm doing this right there see it sticks right out ah finally liberty coins a 1969 another 40 percenter all right let's grab the next roll here we go folks i've already made my quarter for the day so this is awesome let's see what we got is this one yes another one a 1968 and that's a d and nope that's it all right so let's do the next roll this is great i don't know if that one is one nope and okay nothing so when i bring i'll bring you back with another one hold on hang tight a few rows later um right there this one got this guy right here i think it is yes a 1965 a 40 percenter okay let's open up the next one [Music] oh we are we are rolling now we are rolling could this be could this be it is a 1969 on the very next roll i think that's it let me just double check yep okay let's open up the next roll [Music] this is awesome and i still have an ender and there's another one right there another silver [Music] a 1968 d three in a row [Music] plus

10. all right we have nothing okay i'll do a wrap up folks hang tight all right everybody this is the breakdown i am ecstatic first off i set a new box record number one with 43 silver half dollars but let's get right into it so box number one produced a proof 2005. boxes two and three were skunked uh four and five were commemorative sticker coins six seven eight nine skunked 10 we did find a foreign panama coin and box 10 yielded this 43 silver half dollars new record for liberty coins here they are 1956 benjamin franklin the 1964 i found six 1965 i found four 1966 i found one 1967 i got two four six eight ten 1968 two four six eight and four then eight ten twelve thirteen so making that 43 half dollars that i pulled in part one of this epic 50 box half dollar marathon just put in perspective everybody and i'll wrap this up this is a long video i have 50 boxes and if the quota is one per box i've already got 43 so i need to just find seven more silvers in the remaining 40 boxes and i've at least gotten broken even with the quota as far as finding one per box if we use that as an average but there's a great start thank you for watching like share and subscribe help me reach my goal of a thousand subscribers be safe tell your loved ones love them god bless america thank you for watching part two will be coming up shortly uh stay tuned for part two on this epic 50 half dollar box hunt box is 11 through 20. until everybody liberty coin signing off take care everybody yeah all right we'll catch you later bye-bye", "NK8djQdiL5s": "hey everyone i'm mike from northern ridge designs and welcome back to the channel it can be difficult sometimes to get a bubble free epoxy finish especially on wood slabs but in this video i'm going to share some tips with you that will increase your odds of getting a perfect epoxy finish on any wood slab project so let's get started what you're seeing here is an 11 foot long l-shaped walnut bar top with some great character as you're seeing in this knot with a crack there are also a few issues we need to address such as sanding out these oil smudges this bar top was actually in place for a while unfinished also when it was put together i i don't know who did it but the the seam here is kind of a large gap there's also a large chunk of bark missing there we're gonna have to touch both of those things up before we do the epoxy pour this particular knot hole with a or not with a crack in it it's kind of soft but the epoxy should should harden that up it'll be perfectly fine the coolest feature of this entire slab is this bar conclusion it's just huge and it's going to be awesome filled with ocean blue metallic epoxy have to get all the soft and loose bark kind of picked out of there but it's definitely going to be worth it in the final product moving on down you'll see a couple more we have a couple little divots and holes and things that we're gonna have to remove some of the bark and some of the loose materials so that we don't have anything loose and we can fill all the voids with an ocean blue metal can finish the whole thing off with an epoxy finish that just lays right out like glass here we go step one you need to remove all the loose material and i'm going to start with the large bark inclusion and as you work your way through here you need to go nice and slow at the beginning things are going to pop out in large chunks as you're seeing here these came out really easy without much effort whatsoever and i'm going to go through first and make sure i get everything that's loose and easy and then from there i'm going to start picking and trying to find stuff that's a little tougher to get out perhaps just kind of checking along i don't want to remove any kind of wood i don't want to mark up the the wood that surrounds it and mess up that beautiful grain but i definitely want to get anything that's soft or loose out of this void because again we are going to fill this with ocean blue metallic and i just don't want to have anything that's going to move over time so although the video speed is is sped up here i'm going pretty slow and just kind of poking and checking with my little pick here and it's kind of a long process it takes a little time but in the end it's just going to pay off so here we have kind of the final product it's cleaned out you're seeing a lot of little rough edges that's that's fine the epoxy is going to fill in this void and it's just going to pop along with that awesome grain from the bark inclusion as you're probably noticing the bark inclusion went right on through that edge of the slab so had to be kind of careful not to break that chunk of wood off really don't have to repair that but the epoxy is going to have to go up through that void from the top right on out the side so here's a couple more spots that will be filled with the blue and i have to chip out and pull out anything that's loose so what we're going to do is we're just going to jump ahead to the blue in place and all these voids that i have removed the loose material and man that stuff really pops that ocean blue metallic uh as you can see i over filled all voids that way we can sand down flush and there won't be any divots or low spots although you get a little leeway with that with the epoxy finish i tried to keep a lot of the blue out of the crack because we're going to be filling that with a more natural look with sawdust and glue to help fill that in but not make it stand out so much that there's a large crack there and as you're seeing along the edge here this stuff is kind of loose to work with so i used a chunk of mdf i had laying around with some tyvek tape to help hold that epoxy in place as it cured this is a 15 minute quick coat epoxy so it's pretty loose but you have about 15 minutes of working time and you really have to move so once i took that off now what you're seeing is kind of the sharp edge along along there that'll be that'll be sanded flush and that's going to look really good in the end so here's a look once things are sanded down it's as you can see it's a little white but that's from the sanding once we put an epoxy coat over it it's going to fill in the actual scratches that are left on the epoxy and you won't be able to tell also kind of looking here the crack has been filled with some wood glue and sawdust i also took a chunk of walnut bark and fixed that corner sanded it down to make a little better match so there's just a couple little spots of blue here and there that soft knot hole we're going to fill that with epoxy as well and harden it up and there's the bark inclusion so it ended up looking pretty neat all along there and once we get the epoxy on that on that grain around the the blue is just going to be really awesome this is where it becomes pretty obvious that you took your time and filled all these little voids to make sure that you didn't have places where epoxy is going to seep out we're going to get started with our first seal coat and seal coats are what make the difference between a glass-like epoxy finish on wood and one that's got a lot of dimples and bubbles in it what i'm going to do here in the first seal coat is i'm just going to move this product around the wood and let it soak in it's filling all the natural little holes and grains of the walnut each seal coat's going to be about one ounce of epoxy per square foot it's not a ton of material but it's super important that you do this each seal coat will look better than the last one because you're removing some of those areas where the epoxy is going to seep and bubble some people they like to for whatever reason just pour one coat of epoxy on top stand there with a torch for hours on end and still you're gonna end up with some bubbles and and divots in the final product the difference between that and having a glass like epoxy finish are the seal coats in this particular project because it's for a customer and i want a perfect layout i'm going to do three seal coats to make sure i get all of those little voids filled with the epoxy plus we're dealing with the live edge that has bark on one side so i want to make sure that i take my time and brush the epoxy into all those little nooks and crevices along the bark edge i'm using a squeegee to move the material around now i'm coming along the front with a with a short two inch paintbrush to kind of rub that that epoxy in and what's going to happen as this epoxy starts to self level it's not going to level out perfectly smooth because i'm using just enough material to to to kind of spread around and seal off all the grain but it is going to move a little bit it's going to go over the edges so you kind of have to constantly keep going back and forth and rubbing out the drips with the brush both on the bark side as well as the smooth side you're probably noticing here i'm using my hand on the smooth side of the bar that's perfectly fine i'm just trying to smooth out those little drips i just don't want a super uneven edge but it's going to be a little uneven that's just what the seal coat is i'm going to torch it again i'm probably going to do three or four passes with the torch in total this is going to be kind of the most in-depth seal coat that i show you i repeat this process two more times before i do a final flood coat now the difference between a seal coat and the flood coat is that the flood coat has a lot more material actually three times the material i use three ounces per square foot and that's going to get a self-leveling agent okay but after one seal cope this is what you're left with from a distance it looks pretty good but when you get up a little closer you're going to notice all the little imperfections such as all these little bubbles now if i just poured one coat stood there with a torch i would still end up with these because it's the bubbles caused by epoxy soaking into the wood grain and it's going to be a constant thing until the epoxy dries so this is what it is and i'm going to sand it down using 220 and that's all you need to do just kind of lightly sand it i'm going to pop all these little bubbles with the sandpaper and it's going to look pretty ugly luckily the epoxy this is the beautiful thing about epoxy it's going to fill those little scratches here you're seeing some some pretty large little voids that are just going to keep pulling that epoxy in if you didn't do the seal coats you'd never get those filled so this is after the first seal coat and it's it's kind of ugly right now when you get down to it switching up to a top view here get a little better look at my sanding process i just have 220 grit sandpaper on a five inch orbital sander in the description you can see the link to the sandpaper and tools that i'm using but i'm just kind of lightly going over it i just want to see all the imperfections i'm not trying to sand this smooth by any means or sand it flush i'm just trying to make sure that i'm going to get good adhesion with the next layer of epoxy if you pour epoxy right over a smooth hardened surface of epoxy it doesn't have the mechanical bond that is necessary so by sanding with just 220 grit there's little tiny scratches caused by the sandpaper that the next layer of epoxy can grab onto so here's kind of a better look this kind of puts it in perspective as just how uneven and and kind of ugly for lack of a better term that seal coat is the bark really soaks up that epoxy on the first seal coat after that it's going to be less and less material being soaked into it but it helps to smooth out the naturally rough bark there you can see it's kind of a low spot where that soft knot was around the bark inclusion there's the one really big divot there that showed you a little bit earlier it stood right out even when the whole thing was unsanded and between seal coats after i sand it i'm just going to wipe the whole thing off with blue shop towels i'm also going to blow it off with an air gun here kind of looking down the table you can see all the imperfections this is the second seal coat just going to use a squeegee to move the material around and there like magic all those little scratches disappear first time you do an epoxy project and you sand those seal coats you feel like you're just ruining it but really that epoxy it needs those little scratches from the 220 grit to mechanically bond itself to its previous layer and you don't see the scratches at all just looking here even without torching it it's a crystal clear finish and that blue is really popping out of that dark walnut just like the first seal coat i'm going to move a an amount of material that was one ounce per square foot around and around trying to fill in those voids and i kind of keep it moving so that it keeps sinking into those little those little dips and nooks and crannies i'm going to start pushing it over the edge and then i'm going to come through with my brush brush it into the bark as well smooth it out on the backside torching as i go you can see a little bit of cloudiness there and that's just the the epoxy has some bubbles from the mixing so second seal coat has dried at this point you know real close there and you can tell that it looks a lot better than the first seal coat heck some people might even be happy with this at their own home bar but this being for a client i'm going for a glass type finish with no sorts of undulations i guess when you when you look down the epoxy here i'm pointing out just a couple of spots that kind of being sticklers they won't really film with the with the epoxy and what i'm probably going to have to do to those spots is use a burn-in stick now it's another product for another video but with the seal coats you're going to eliminate 98 of those a burn-in stick is just kind of a hard wax that you melt into the spot and it fills that little void and then you can just put epoxy right over it's color matched to walnuts so you can't even tell it's there here we've sanded the second seal coat looks a lot better than the first one most of the little bubbles at this point are out of it there's just kind of some low spots and some high spots but the final flood coat which you're seeing here will take care of that the final flood coat is self leveling it's an eighth inch thick when you pour it on the material and it's going to level right out so i'm going to get right down low and you can see there are no dips and divots or bubbles of any kind i went ahead and did a third seal coat i saved putting that in this video because it's quite redundant it's the same exact steps that i went through on the first and second seal coats if you're curious what the final flood coat entails i have a couple videos that show that process but involves an eighth inch square notch trowel and again you're going to get a perfect finish following these seal coat steps you just can't find any imperfections the bark took that epoxy wonderfully and it smoothed the whole thing out so people aren't going to catch their clothes on any kind of sharp edges or anything and looking down the bar i mean you just can't be happier with the way that this laid out there you have the final product if you take the time to do a few seal coats on wood slabs you're really going to help set yourself up for a great end result hopefully you found this video helpful and if you have any questions or suggestions please leave them in the comments below make sure you

round these requests poured in after we demonstrated Tim Hamilton's dumbbell and barbell slugs Wow I did have a lot of thumbs in my opinion these two rounds rated very high on the badass scale this one passed sideways through Kevlar body armor also made out of machined steel the dumbbell round had very impressive results rather than tumbling through the air these maintain an efficient aerodynamic profile until it strikes flesh then it begins tumbling causing maximum damage now let's take a look at the bolo rounds or macho gaucho these exotic rounds complete with their exotic price are restricted in some parts of the country oddly not in California costing around four times the cost of a traditional foster slug let's see what makes me so special let me use a clear chet ight hole with a clear overshot card on top to keep everything held inside inside we have the projectile itself riding in the shot cup of an mg42 style wadding normally used for steel shot the projectile consists of two lead balls connected with a metallic cabling that's easy to pull apart the lead balls measure roughly 1/2 inch in diameter or about 13 millimeters and when spread apart the span is about five inches or about 125 millimetres and there you go Europe now stop blaming me that you were not taught the imperial system while the weight of the projectile is a hefty 36 grams the weight of the powder load is rather light weighing in at only 17 grains don't you love all these crazy measurements welcome back to fledermaus errs hey today we're out here to try the macho gaucho this is around from fire quest that is supposed to be too heavy lead balls connected by a piece of cable so we cut one of them apart to take a look at what they with inside before we shoot them this idea came to us from you guys after we shot Tim with machinist we shot his dumbbell rounds and we had a lot of suggestions about shooting around it was two balls connected by a chain well the chain doesn't exist but two balls connected by a little piece of steel cable we're going to give them a try and see how they work our theory is that two balls crammed together with a cable are not going to separate out like they should and go fly-in downrange with a nice stretched out cable in between them as is shown on the picture but I think the two balls are going to probably stick together and just kind of keep that cable crunched up in there well let's give it a try and see what we can find how will they fare on the lead plate it so those things buried themselves into this lead plate not very deep but still impacted and as you can see on camera their little tiny steel cable fibers where one ball is stacked on top of the other ball with the cable smashed in between the two of them well it's accurate to you know it was yeah 20 yards maybe 20 yards and aiming for that little button okay oh I thought they would have used little piece of sticker in a nice little peephole there look at that and there's a cable all mashed up inside okay we have a low resolution with very high frame rate of 38,000 frames a second but we can clearly see that there is absolutely no separation of the two balls you're actually touching when they impact sucked oh boy okay 22 yards 29.9 go boys hit it in the door boys okay yep you hear that fat yeah here is the projectile as we found in the Kevlar now it's important to note that we were able to pull these balls apart so there is no fouling or nodding of the cabling to prevent them from spreading on their own now looking at the high-speed footage of this shot we could see that the balls have spread maybe the thickness of your thumb in this shot there doesn't seem to be any external force that would actually cause the balls to spread apart so let's try to influence that a little bit the way we'll do that is install what's called a rifle choke on the end of the shotgun this should provide a little bit of thin and a triple force yeah rifle choke in there now we'll see if that has any effect on it okay we're gonna find out if these are effective against drone attacks oh my Oh big splash out there right software hit the DDI maverick and the maverick phantom one it would have severed it severs the wires sever the wires just so we can shut it down we're just trying to shut it down not destroy it now one of the balls you can see hit right there and it's a pretty big big ball they're bigger than the in a doubleheader out there so you can see that one hit right there and tore the body out of it and the other barely skimmed that arm right there and ends up tearing the wires out from underneath well I'd say we effectively brought down this drone at 25 yards yeah okay Dukey top here is your review of your drone that you sent me that I couldn't even charge up because you sent a European plug thank you using the rifle choke had no added effect to this the balls again had very minimal spread hey well decapitate a ballistic guilt gummy bear hit it look at him Wow steel splashes okay again the balls are touching and you have to ask is that's so bad well yeah because we were promised cheese cutter like performance and we expected to slice this gummy bear made out of ballistic gel completely in half and this thing just behaved like a low-power slug what are you are 18 yards who knows who she's talking all on a vaguely Asian reporter ready I'm ready Wow solid I was both balls please they they crew the thing was probably worth at least 1995 somebody online will tell us that it was worth a thousand dollars yeah it was worth it though she evidently took one of the forehead one of the balls I don't know what organization every time we predict what happened we're completely wrong when we show the I see footage I say I'm ready for chips into the road hot shot now as I often say slow motion does not like again the balls had almost no separation and instead of slicing the doll in half we just got kind of a mediocre impact with it what's into that impressive now you got to look at the bright side at least these rounds are accurate it would have really sucked if we missed every shot okay I'm ready macho culture oh I don't know I see one good hold on there I'll say mr. senator of the blue they obviously tore apart because we've got a bully impact hole here and the yellow out here this one kept the cable with it you see it did a little whiplash thing in there so it cut all the way through it cut all the way through if you come around the backside it a nice little flash okay now you can also hear I don't know if you can hear on camera but this one hit later than this one too there was a little bit of a zip sound to it so the cable slowed it down I think a little bit this was shot at about 35 yards and I want to be the first one to say that Greg was wrong the one with the cable attached actually hit first and out of the six rounds that we fired this was the only one that had a catastrophic failure the bubble round definitely has a nasty reputation but it's got a reputation that it really doesn't deserve it's a pretty low power round and it definitely doesn't function like we would expect it to with the cables spreading out now just adding more powder to it to make it more powerful probably would have worked against the design we saw that one round actually ripped the cable out of one of the balls so we probably would have seen more of that occurring just from the stress of trying to propel it much faster now ballistic machinists CNC machined steel slugs are the real deal and he is actually going to begin sewing these pretty soon and I said it because a lot of people have asked this if Tim sells the round side we have tested in some of our videos and it's kind of gone from a hobby into a potential business for Tim so that's really good news for him of course machining a slug out of Steel is a lot more expensive and time-consuming than just casting something out of lead so I'm kind of surprised he's able to price those slugs at such a competitive price I hope you enjoyed watching this video we had a lot of fun doing it thank you and bye-bye be sure to subscribe so

perfect for you to make for that really big uh what was it again that um really big concert that they do you know every year in the beginning of february and they put a sporting event at before and after it do you know what i'm talking about um but anyways i'm going to be sharing my aunt mary's really yummy enchilada dip as well as my mother-in-law's taco chip dip which should definitely be scooped and enjoyed with some doritos so stay tuned and i'll be sharing those with you they will be in the description box below in case you're interested in trying them for yourself and definitely let me know what it is that you guys uh make for that halftime show let's whip up a batch of enchilada dip so the first thing you're gonna need for this is eight ounces or one package of cream cheese i recommend that you have it softened a little bit in the microwave first just to make it easier to mix it up we are also going to add to this one can of mild fire roasted diced green chilies these are the market pantry brand they don't have to be fire roasted i just grabbed that and we're gonna actually use these undrained we're gonna put them all in there then we're also going to add one cup of shredded cheese the recipe calls for mexican style shredded cheese my cooking assistant is going to add one teaspoon of garlic powder and i'm gonna go ahead and add one quarter teaspoon of chili powder and now we're gonna go ahead and use a hand held blender to beat this all together and then we're gonna add our chicken now we're gonna add in some cooked and finely chopped chicken breasts right in there and i'm just going to stir that in now you could absolutely add a little bit more chicken if you want or this would be great to make a double batch if you are gonna have a gathering but it's just gonna be us tonight so we're just having it for a fun appetizer so voila it's as simple as that we are going to go ahead and pour this into our high plate and we're going to bake this at about 350 for 20 to 30 minutes and just when it comes out we're going to top it with a little bit more cheese now if you wanted to make this spicier you could do a not mild diced green chilies and you could certainly do pepper jack cheese instead of mexican style cheese for even more heat in there so we're just gonna smooth this out and we will put it in the oven again i will leave the recipe in the description box below in case you are interested in trying it out i just pulled the enchilada dip piping hot and bubbling out of the oven now we're going to add a half of a cup of additional cheese because you know cheese is the stuff of life it makes everything better right so we're literally just going to sprinkle a little bit of cheese on top and then all you have to do is wait 10 minutes and the cheese is going to melt beautifully right on top of this because obviously it's already hot out of the oven you certainly could put it under the broiler if you want to golden brown up the cheese a bit that would be delicious and if you're trying to do the low carb thing i think this would be great if you scooped a little bit onto those sweet mini peppers you know just like hollow them out and put a scoop of this in there that would be unbelievably good all right it is completely melted and looking absolutely delicious so i'm going to take my scoop of bell pepper here and let's try a bite one for you so good so good i hope you guys enjoy this one and again recipe is linked below so here is the recipe we are making in case you want to grab a quick screenshot i will definitely leave this linked in the description box below or i should say typed up in the description box below in case you are interested all right so for this recipe we need uh one package of cream cheese that is softened it'll make it so much easier to beat it so if you soften it on the counter or you can even stick in the microwave for you know 10 to 15 seconds to help soften it up a little quicker you can do that and then we're going to use one can of the jalapeno cheese dip and i like to make it in a large rubbermaid container so that i can store it that way and then people can scoop out what they want we're going to go ahead and use one can of nice and processed cheese dip tasty but you know full of horrible things i'm sure did you see that i landed on my arm a little on the messy side we're gonna go ahead and add one cup of sour cream and our cheese dip right to the container getting as much out of that as possible the sour cream just gives it a more scoopable consistency gave her processed orange cheese definitely not something we eat all the time but this would be great for like super bowl sunday or if you're watching a football game if that's your jam i don't watch football but you know if you do you could or let's be honest if you're just feeling like eating junk food all right so i'm going to go ahead and use my electric hand mixer to whip this all together and i'll be right back so once you have your cheese dip all mixed up and then smooth it out into a nice even layer you're going to top this with salsa i am using a mild salsa but you could absolutely use medium or hot if you like a little bit more spice i like the layer of salsa to be um not quite as thick as the dip the cheese dip on the bottom you could absolutely add a layer of guacamole to this if you want or refried beans but this is my mother-in-law's recipe so i'm just making it how she does and then you're going to of course top this with sharp cheddar cheese i'm going to go ahead and use the whole bag and we serve this up with doritos but you could do it with regular tortilla chips if you prefer just trying to get my nice even layer of cheese you could also do black olives if you normally eat those on your tacos and then the last thing we're going to add on top is shredded lettuce so this is an eight ounce bag of lettuce and i'm going to go ahead and i think probably use all of it so if you wanted to you could use romaine instead of iceberg but voila if you are going to make this ahead ahead of time i would just do the cheese dip layer and then add the salsa and the cheese and the lettuce later on so that is it guys that's all there is to it i'm just gonna let this uh refrigerate and chill until we are ready to enjoy it on junk food night don't forget to like subscribe and ring the bell i will leave the recipe in the description box like i said and i will be talking to you again soon guys bye-bye", "z97PbnvW7CY": "hey everyone it's sarah thread stern nurse RN comm and in this video I want to be going over grain calculations what I'm going to do in this video is I'm going to show you how to convert basic problems to grains like grams milligrams - grains and then I'm going to take that and apply it to dosage and calculation word problems and as always you can access the worksheet the quizzes and the other dosage and calculation series over here or in the description below so let's get started okay before we get started solving our grain calculation problems let's go over some basic concepts first thing the Roman numerals a lot of times with grain problems the question will be written out maybe with a Roman numeral so you need to know the most common Roman numerals used in these problems for instance like this problem says grade X equals how many milligrams a lot of people are like what in the world is X X is Roman numeral for 10 so it's like 10 grains so let's get over these basic ones that you want to commit to memory is a lot of times it has a bar written over it or has two dots may not have anything it means a hat so 0.5 is s I means 1 s s again means 1/2 so it'll be 1 and 1/2 D means 5 X means 10 and X V means 15 now whenever I solve these problems I use dimensional analysis analysis so the magic numbers you want to remember when solving these problems are the following because this is going to make your job a lot easier is this one grain equals 60 milligrams and 15 grains equals 1 gram all we have to do is plug those in and we can get our answer depending on if we're trying to get two milligrams or grains so let's get started with doing some basic conversions ok this problem says grain x equals how many milligrams we learned that X is Roman numeral 10 so let's set up a problem using dimensional analysis so 10 grains equals how many milligrams because that is where we're trying to get to and we know from our magic number that one grain equals 60 milligrams so one grain equals 60 milligrams and grains cancels out and we are ready to solve so multiply everything at the top and everything at the bottom and then divide so 10 times 60 is 600 and carry or 1 over and 600 divided by 1 is 600 so 10 grains equals 600 milligrams okay let's do our next problem two grains equals how 2 grams equals how many grains okay so let's set up a problem two grams equals how many greens and we know from our magic number that one gram equals 15 grains grams cancels out and we're ready to solve so 2 times 15 is 30 Terrier 1 over and our answer 30 divided by 1 is 30 so 2 grams equals 30 grains okay let's solve our next problem one-fourth grains equals how many milligrams a lot of times these fractions trip people up but all you got to do is just convert it to a decimal that's how you do it it's a lot easier but if you want to queue in a fraction you can but 1/4 is 0.25 0.25 that's what that is so be 0.25 grains equals how many milligrams that's where we're trying to get and we know from our magic number that there is one grain in 60 milligrams grains cancels out we're left with milligrams so 0.25 times 60 equals 15 and we're carry our one over and 15 divided by one is 15 so 15 milligrams one-fourth grains equals 15 milligrams now let's look at some word problems okay the first problem says doctor orders armored thyroid grains 10 by mouth daily your supplied with 3 milligram tablets how many tablets will you administer per dose so what we're solving for is tablets per dose that is where we're trying to get so what's right where we're trying to get trying to get two tabs per dose and remember the Roman numeral X means ten so let's just write that out to help us remember so it's ten grains is where we're trying to get so let's set up our problem using dimensional analysis okay okay so the doctor orders 10 grains is one dose and we need to convert this to milligrams because that is what we're supplied with 300 milligrams so how many of that of those tablets we're going to give so we need to convert grains to milligrams to get there so we know from our magic number that one grain equals 60 milligrams grains cancels out okay so we're there but now we need to apply these numbers to what we're supplied with and we're supplied with 300 milligram tablets so 300 milligrams equals one tablet hey milligrams cancels out we're exactly where we need to be we're in tabs per dose so let's solve 10 times 60 times one is six hundred and one times one times 300 is 300 and 600 divided by 300 is two so we're going to be giving two tablets to equal that 10 grain dose that the doctor ordered this problem says doctor orders Tamil one gram by mouth every six hours as needed for pain you're supplied with five grains per capsule how many capsules will you administer so we're trying to get two capsules per dose solution draw it out where we're trying to get caps per dose okay so let's set up a problem okay the doctor ordered one gram one gram is one dose and we know from our magic numbers that one gram equals 15 grains because we have to convert to get two grains because that is what we're supplied with so one gram equals 15 grains grams cancels out so we're converted but let's see with what we're supplied with how many were actually going to give so it says five grains equals one capsule so five grains equals one capsule we're there we're where we need to get we need to get two caps per dose so let's multiply everything at the top and at the bottom and divide so one times 15 times one is 15 and one times one times five is five so 15 divided by 5 is 3 so we're going to be giving three capsules per dose this problem says doctor orders a liquid suspension of aspirin 180 milligrams by mouth daily you're supplied with grains v / 2 MLS how many milliliters will you administer per dose so instead of trying to solve for tablets or capsules we're trying to figure out the liquid amount in milliliters so that's where we're trying to go is milliliters per dose and look we have a Roman numeral in here so what does the mean it means 5 so in other words this means five grains celestials write that out to help us five grains per 2 MLS that is what we're supplied with okay so let's set this problem up and saw okay the doctor orders a hundred and eighty milligrams per dose and we know from our magic number that 60 milligrams equals one grain grain milligrams cancels out however we're converted but we have to yet two milliliters per dose because we're supplied with this liquid suspension and we need to know how much to pour out in this cup to give the patient of aspirin so there's five grains for every five in every two MLS there's five grains of aspirin so five grains because that's what grain V meant equals two MLS and grains cancels out and where we need to be milliliters per dose so we're ready to solve so 180 times 1 times 2 equals 360 and 1 times 60 times 5 equals 300 so 360 divided by 300 equals 1.2 MLS per dose so that is how much we're going to pour out to give this patient of this aspirin this problem says doctor orders diazepam 5 milligrams IV every 6 hours as needed for agitation you're supplied with grains ISS which again means grains one and a half per 2 ml vial how many milliliters will you administer per dose so we have this vial of diazepam and we're going to we need to draw up some in our syringe to give this patient so we're trying to get 2 milliliters per dose and remember i SS means grains 1 and a hat 1 and 1/2 grains or I like to put mine in decimal so 1.5 grains per 2 MLS okay so let's work this problem okay doctor orders 5 milligrams so 5 milligrams equals one dose and we know from our magic numbers that 60 milligrams equals one grain because we're trying to get two grains because that's what we have on hand so 60 milligrams equals one grain milligrams cancels out where we need to be but now let's apply that to what we're supplied with and what we're supplied with is 1.5 grains per every 2 ml so every two milliliters we draw up in that serene just want to have 1.5 grains so one point five grains equals two MLS grains cancels out and where we need to be we're milliliters per dose so we're ready to solve so 5 times 1 times 2 is 10 and 1 times 60 times 1.5 is 90 so 10 divided by 90 equals zero point zero zero point 1 1 1 repeating and we'll round that to zero point one so zero point one milliliters per dose is how much we're going to give this patient of diazepam per what the doctor ordered this problem says doctor orders morphine one eighth grains IV every four hours as needed for pain you're supplied with a vial that says two milligrams per ml how many milliliters per dose will you administer ok so we're trying to get 2 milliliters per dose so let's write our goal milliliters per dose and I like to convert my fractions 1/8 to decimals so 1/8 and in decimal form is 0.125 so that's how many grains we're going to give if you ever need to convert fraction to a decimal real fast what you can do is just divide one into a and that gives you your decimal form ok so let's set our problem up ok the doctor ordered point one two five grains so 0.125 grains equals our dough so the doctor ordered and we know that one grain equals 60 milligrams so one gray 9 equals 60 milligrams rains cancels out now we got to get how much we need to draw up in our vial because it's in milligrams per ml so there are 2 milligrams in 1 ml milligrams cancels out and we're where we need to be in milliliters per dose so we're ready to solve so 0.125 times 60 is 7.5 and 1 times 1 times 2 is 2 and 7.5 divided by 2 is 3.75 so 3.75 milliliters per dose is what we are going to draw up to give this patient okay that is how you solve brain calculations now be sure to go to my

couple different types of shotgun shells here I've got twelve gauges of four times we're not going to worry about the gauge of the shell between the 410 on the 12-gauge what we're going to look at is the shot size inside lots of times when people start shot using shotguns they don't understand it fully what these numbers mean so like this is a four shot a five shot six shot seven point five and nine you can get these all interchange you know you can get six shot and the four times size we have here you can get 7.5 in the 12-gauge I just couldn't get all twelve gauges in the store so we've got a little bit of mix of the size of the shell but the actual bb's inside are gonna be the same size of course you'll have more fill in the larger 12-gauge shells then you would in the smaller four times so what we're gonna go do up here is go ahead and open these all up you guys can see the size of the shot inside now I'm sure I'm gonna make a little bit of a mess but I'll just go ahead and vacuum when I'm done because I'm sure I'll drop some of these but we're gonna cut each one of these open so you guys can see the difference of the shot sizes and how big they are as the number gets smaller the bb's our pellets inside actually get larger so let's go ahead and start with the nine shot this is just a Remington 410 it's got nine shot inside so when you go ahead and cut into this one hopefully these aren't gonna be too hard for me to cut into okay they're not too bad pretty easy so we're gonna go down here now and empty these out and like I said I know I'm gonna make a little bit of a mess but that's alright I'm not gonna bother emptying them all out well empty more all right there's a lot more in here there you go that's nine shot and of course like I said if you got nine shot in a 12-gauge you have a lot more little pellets in there because you have a lot more space to fill in a 12-gauge so these are really tiny I'll zoom up on them here so you can see them they're very tiny and there's a whole bunch of them grab a couple and just hold them up in front of the camera here also a whole bunch of them little little tiny shots there these people use for bird shooting and such and they're going to give you a lot of spread but they're not going to be as effective for bigger game let's go to 7.5 shot these are very commonly used these are commonly used again for bird shooting the nines are often used for clay pigeon shooting and stuff like that and also shooting flying birds 7.5 is very common again for a shooting birds that are flying they can be used for clay pigeons but usually people go down to the 9 for that so this is 7.5 here I don't want to get it to cut open here and sip a little back alright so here's 7.5 and I'll try to zoom in here so you can see they are bigger let me grab a few of these 7.5 and here's the 7.5 so let me grab a couple nines hard to grab these you might not be able to tell which ones are which now they're kind of mixing in get them separate here if I can these two over here are 9 and these are 7.5 so you can see that 7.5 are bigger not a huge difference but there is definitely a difference now let's go to the number 6 and these are going to make a bigger mess cuz there's gonna be a lot more because these are bigger shelves well like I said we're just looking at the size of the shop side so this is a number 6 these are used often for birds also used a lot for rabbits and such rabbit hunting and such used for a small game a lot all right so these are number six shot and this has some padding in there as well like I said the 12-gauge gonna hold a little bit more so that's most of them out there there's one or two left so the white stuff in there is just filling to make sure it's fully a full shell so there's no air in it so here's the six shot and I'll compare that there to the seven shot so as you can see the six shot pretty good amount bigger than the 7.5 let's go ahead and keep moving down the line here we have five it's getting harder and harder to cut into some of these larger ones are harder alright so here's the five shot like cut it enough yet and these just look a different color because they are plated so now we have five shot and as you can see five shot is just ever so slightly bigger try to get a little side-by-side here here is the five shot versus the six shot and as you can see the five shot is ever so slightly larger now let's move down to the four shot this one's filled with little seeds it looks like interesting never seen that before so now again same thing is the last couple they're a little bit bigger now there are three shot two shot one shot and you know they just keep getting a little bit bigger then we can get into even larger here's double out buck and there's nine pellets in each one of these and double-aught buck it's gonna be a good amount bigger this is more for shooting larger game and obviously they have a named buck for shooting deer and into this one this one's gonna be filled with a lot of filling because there's just nine pellets in this one this one actually says on the box nine pellets I think I got them all so as we can see here now much much larger these are pretty darn big bee bees here and big leg pieces that's like shooting they're a little smaller than nine millimeter I believe they're like 0.33 of an inch or so something around there and they're really big now they didn't fill up the whole cartridge or they mostly did but they use this filling to fill up the rest of the cartridge usually you're gonna get between eight and ten pellets and the 12-gauge buck shots now we have this was double out buck now we have triple out buck and this one is a 410 this one has four triple out box in here so let's go ahead and open this one up again if you had triple a buck in a 12-gauge you would have more like between eight and ten pellets this one's gonna be hard to cut because I'm sure the pellets are taken up pretty much this whole space might dull my knife a little bit cutting these open all right I think I got it enough yep so this is triple out buck this is a home defense round before ten this will go in my handgun my revolver and this one just says for now like I said if you get 12-gauge you're gonna have more these are I believe point three sixth of an inch and it's kind of weird these two are kind of stuck together interesting there they broke apart they would have and these are hard to tell right here's the triple triple lot and the double lot you can tell the triple lot is larger so these four basically took up almost that whole shell length and this is basically like almost as big as nine millimeters so when you shoot one of these it's like shooting four nine-millimeter bullets all at once out of the little four ten if you had it in here you'd be shooting you know between eight and ten there's how many they would put in a 12-gauge now we have these PDX one home defense defenders they're called these go into things like the tourist judge or Smith & Wesson governor revolvers and this is a home defense round this actually has three defense pellets and also lots of little bb's 12 little bb's so these are three defense pellets are going to be about the same diameter as the triple a buck there but they're not going to be round so let me go ahead and see if we can get into here okay I think I got in and what we have here I can get these out well here's the one pallet let me just show this pellet first I got the second one out now here comes the third one after this third one falls out we'll see all these extra little bb's doesn't quite yeah let me see if I just cut it off all right so there's one more pellet right here get that out if we can all right so there's our three pellets and let me go ahead before I dump these bb's out and show these pellets are basically triple a buck it's just they're a different shape they're actually a little bit bigger and wider larger diameter however then they're not circular they're flat pallets so these will fire out of the gun first and behind it you got 12 bb's extra so in a home defense situation you can use something like triple a buck or you could use something like the PDX ones you're gonna get three big pallets followed by some extra bb's for you know some extra spread so you know you're gonna hit something basically now these little bb's it looks like they're probably about number two sides because number fours are good amounts smaller than they are so I'd say these these babies are pretty pretty big to begin with as well so these home defense rounds are pretty highly rated by the company and as well I've heard good reviews about them so these are great for home defense and as you can see here that's what comes out of them the last thing you got is slugs now I do have some slugs for four times and 12-gauge basically a slug is just one big hunk of metal so in here don't know if you can see this on camera you can kind of see the shade of it here this is gonna be alright guys so my camera battery died I had to charge it up a bit so we left off on the shelf I mean the 12 gauge slug here I'm gonna go ahead and try to into this right behind the slug I think I could see it here this one might have some backing to it this one might probably be the hardest one to get into alright it looks like I got into it and we got some padding let me see if I can push this out looks like I can alright so here is a 12 gauge slug and as you can see it's one big hunk of metal we'll compare it to the triple at buck here and as you can see there's just no comparison now with this you just get one shot so it's you know they use this for deer hunting and other things it's not really used too often for home defense because you do only have that one shot but then again if you're you know a good shot it is a pretty devastating round so basically I just wanted to go ahead and open these all up like I said the size of the cartridge here that we're showing doesn't really matter what I was trying to show is the size of the bb's inside and like I said earlier of course you're gonna have more fill in a 12-gauge shell than you would in the smaller shells 28 gauge 20 gauge 18 gauge so on though the more the smaller the shell gets the less fill it's gonna have as you can see over here there's obviously more filled in the number six than we have in the 7.5 because the number six has more space inside to contain more pellets or bb's in there so just want to go ahead and show that so you guys can see the difference I was kind of confused myself when I started shooting shotguns again and I just wanted to show you guys the difference so people head and buy shells you know what you're getting so anyways have any questions let me know and I will see y'all later", "I6tY12Jsvtw": "[Music] [Music] [Music] perfect [Music] good morning everyone hope you're all having a wonderful day today before we get started if you want to go ahead and like share subscribe all the sort of good stuff if you want to support the channel and anything else I do help me buy more bullets go ahead and check out some of the links in the description but let's go ahead and talk about one of the most excellent optics if not the most excellent budget optic that you can get it's a low-power variable zoom which is pretty much my favorite style of optic and that is of course the utg I believe it's the Accu shot they're one to eight by 28 now let's go ahead and talk about a couple things that make this really really excellent so I picked up this entire package as you see it right here for 134 dollars including their mount now the mount by itself is like 40 45 dollars depending on where you're buying it from so that with the optic for 134 dollars is absolutely insane and to put my money where my mouth is I bought two of them so I have two exact ones this when you're actually got a little cheaper this one here I got from extreme tactical while they had it on sale the whole package for 125 dollars so I paid on on average about 130 dollars for these guys you can still find them for 135 like I got this guy for but generally speaking if you go to like OpticsPlanet or something else they're gonna be selling them closer to 200 dollars with shipping which is way too much or not to much I definitely think they're worth it for that money but you can find them a lot cheaper with free shipping on ebay 434 dollars you can go to extreme tactical and get it for like 120 hundred 25 right now so currently the price that they're selling for these guys is pretty crazy I would say it is the best deal on an optic if you need a low-power variable zoom that's not a 1 to 6 this is a 1 to 8 that will get into all the technical specifications of it in a little while so first up let's go ahead and talk about its features this is of course a 1 to 8 which gives you an immense amount of options it's probably the best overall magnification range for an AR style rifle unless it's a long-range precision error build like a 20 inch AR 15 or 20 24 inch ar-10 something like that where you're doing a lot of long-range or a competition shooting or something like that 1 to 8 gives you a huge amount of versatility and in 0 to 500 yards it's pretty much the best one optic solution that you can get now of course you can spend more money like a 1 to 10 or even in some cases like a 1 to 12 which is kind of a nutty range but you're gonna be spending a lot more money on those sorts of things and a 1 to 8 is perfectly acceptable for a 0 to 500 yards even out further you can definitely make shocks a lot further on steel man-sized targets that sort of thing for a long-range precision shooting you want a little bit more magnification on there when you need to be very precise with where you're putting those bullets at long range but for 0 to 500 very functional accuracy 1 to 8 is absolutely excellent for getting the job done now as you saw in the intro I have taken both of these rifles and both of these optics out to 500 yards very very easy that both very easy to get set up and get on target at 500 yards these are both MOA or sub MOA rifles with the right ammunition I use Mac tech 168 grain sierra matchking or Federal Premium I pretty much interchange them as the same round because they function the same out of both of my guns so 0 to 500 yards that's really how I use them I live in the western US I'm sorry western Washington specifically and it's really really wooded and so finding a place that you can shoot 500-700 or even a thousand yards it's very very difficult so you don't need an uber amount of magnification 1 to 8 is perfect and having that 1 X that really low end allows you to do up-close stuff as well as stretch it out to you as far as you need to a sensor now something to mention is when you get those very large magnification ranges like 1 to 8 1 to 10 you are going to start sacrificing other things in order to fit that into a single package and so we are going to talk about some of the downsides of that some of the other features of this guy really quick are we do have 36 colors for the reticle and you have a memory system on the back that you can access by pressing a couple buttons it's mostly useless I pretty much just stick to red or green but some of the colors actually do show up brighter and then some of the other ones so kind of figure out which one shows up best for you and then just set it and forget it the 36 colors is a gimmick but it's kind of there so it's interesting but not all that interesting it does come with a integral sunshade that's built into the front so it has an angle to help cut out some of the sun's reflections not really sure if it's needed but it is there it's not a quickly straight to design because this is a 30 millimeter tube with a 28 millimeter objective lens so it actually does have a little bit wider of a front end then you're like 24 millimeters or other things like that on your normal scopes which is nice that it does have that on there it does make it look a little bit less clean than your other lpv is but it still has a good overall look it is definitely actually a little bit more bulky here in the back end because it has that 36 color module back here where it changes all the colors the battery compartment is right on top very easy to get in and out of it is only filled and it is waterproof at least as far as UTG claims though I haven't tested I have taken doubt it and rain and haven't had any issues with it though I generally don't have any issues and just a light rain with many optics that I've tried it does have really nice zero resettable turrets these were extremely easy to get set up a non-target ziering with these guys very very easy it comes with all the hardware to reset them you've basically taken allen key loose up the top pull it reset it and then lock it back down you're good to go the clicks on here you can pie here are very very tactile very easy very very smooth as well especially for the low price range most the time they're very mushy and they're not they're not to precise thing but these are actually really really nice really tactile really audible have really good feedback on them and they actually track very accurately so the other day a couple days ago I took it out and I wanted to do a specific tracking test to see how well they actually track return-to-zero how when I adjust them if they actually adjust accurately and so just a couple days ago I went ahead I took this guy out and I did a tracking test with it so the ammunition that I was using for it was wolf ammunition wolf 145 grain it was just what I had on me I didn't I didn't want to take out my really expensive animal just to do a tracking test with it so I did the tracking test at 50 yards Isay rode it so I had the dial reset to zero shot a three-round group very tight again we're only at 50 yards then I raised it 10m away and the group raised five inches shot another three round group I dropped it 20m away and again it went down about 10 inches this time then I raised it back to zero sent it to the right 10m away moved over to the right about ten five inches moved it left 20 then you had of course the group on the other side a nice little group and then reset both dials and it was perfectly back in the center another three-round group and it pretty much just overlaid right on top of each other so as far as I can tell it tracks very accurately I'm not going to say that it tracks perfectly accurately every single time but it was incredibly easy at 500 yards in the videos that I have of this guy I haven't released the video of that guy out to 500 yards yet but adjusting them to zero what 500 yards was very very easy and very manageable so I wasn't really worried about oh it's not going to track accurately at that distance that I'm gonna throw my zero off and not be able to find where I'm hitting again it was very very easy to adjustable its to hit where I wanted to adjust the reticle and all honestly the tracking on here is much better much more accurate than a lot of other scopes that I've had that for the round the three hundred dollar price range I thought I missing everything it takes a long time for it to get there so now one of the things that you don't get when you throw one to eight magnification inside of a inexpensive platform is you don't get something that's slim you don't get something that's lightweight so you are definitely sacrificing in that way for instance this optic is over 10 inches it's about 11 inches long it's fairly bulky on the sides and in the rear here for the 36 color module which is again kind of a gimmick not really useful at all it is heavy at about 21 ounces by itself so almost a pound and a half by itself now the amount that it comes with is their true strength platform mount it's a great 70 71 I think it's t6 or t6 5-1-1 aluminum it's a very very strong durable mount especially for the money it has a excellent three screw mounting system that locks down into the rail and of course into the side itself so it's an excellent mount it hasn't moved whatsoever with this you could probably take a hammer - and you wouldn't be able to budget at all so I really like that about it it does also add about an inch and a half forward on your scope so you have a lot of options in terms of where you put it depending on how limited you are for rail space and I relief [Applause] now something else about the mount that does kind of go with the overall downside of the system is that it's really heavy it is a lot of aluminum on there which does add to its durability and its toughness but it's also of course going to add weight so it's a question of do you need to add that much weight to your system to for durability or why not you can definitely go with a lot of lighter mounts that are gonna save you a couple ounces on the top of your gun which can or cannot be a big deal depending on your situation now if you're using this as mostly a Prohm gun or you know just shooting out of the back of your truck or you know you only put around stone every now and again probably not a big deal but it is something to mention that this is not a small lightweight package so keep in mind you are definitely sacrificing the light weight of your build so if you already have a heavy ar-10 like this guy and you throw this optics set up on top even though it's only a one to eight it's not a super huge package like a full-size scope it is a lot of weight on the top your rifle so it makes this guy into like a ten and a half 11 pound rifle so now let's go ahead and talk about some of the other things about this guy that I really like so another thing that is excellent about this guy is the eye relief so the eye relief on this guy is three and a half to five inches so at the 1x which is what it's at right now you have an immense range of where you can put your stock or where you can set it up what you can be against where you can be putting your rifle whatever angle you're at and still have an excellent field of view the eye box is also very very forgiving especially at 1x so you can move your head left and right and up and down and still get a decent sight picture out of it it's of course nothing like a red dot you're never gonna get that open red dot look but it's pretty good especially at 1x but then of course when you're flipping it over to 8 X or I box is going to tighten up a little bit and it's going to move forward actually so that's when you're gonna get into the three-and-a-half inch range and now at the three-and-a-half inch range you still do have a good amount of forward and backwards motion but the left/right up/down all that sort of stuff on your eye box really tightens up but you still do have about an inch where you can move your head forwards and backwards and they'll have a really good sight picture so for this guy here depending on different setups it's really versatile and can go on pretty much anything so you could throw this on a really short compact build a little bit longer heavier build and you'll be pretty much good to go and of course you do also have a lot of options when it comes to the mount itself and how far you can put the optic forward depending on your situation in your build there's really only a couple of the things that we need to talk about when it comes to this guy specifically is the reticle choice this is of course a second focal plane rifle scope so if you just have to have a first focal plane you're gonna need to spend a little bit more money but this guy here is a second focal plane so that reticle is not going to change size when you cycle through the zoom ranges this guy here that I have is the BG full reticle it is the most useful reticle that they have they have like four different ones I want to say they have a mil - a mil dot a circle dot which is more of a CQB style so at 8 X it's probably not super useful and then they have this guy which is the BG 4 reticle which is designed it's a BDC so it's a ballistic drop compensation reticle it's really really open it has a very crisp 1 MOA Center dot so it's very usable out to 800 a thousand yards on there especially if you're shooting it like a 10-inch steel plate like I was so even at 500 yards it's still very very precise more than precise enough fold I'm doing with it and on top of that around your Center dot you have a lot of open space so it's very crisp very clear and very easy to put that Center dot right where you need it now on top of that when you do illuminate your reticle it only illuminates that Center dot now it's not incredibly bright but in most situations that will still show up in the day unless you're like staring into the Sun where it's super bright out then you probably won't be able to pick it up very well but in most situations it is going to be slightly illuminated and show up a little bit brighter than the rest of the reticle and of course being by itself allows it in my opinion to be a little bit faster when it's not quite so cluttered around the area and then you have also of course the windage adjustments on the left and right and of course on the bottom as well now this one specifically is set up for a 5 5 6 out to 700 yards I want to say now you can do the calculations and kind of adjust that so your 400 at this zero is actually 357 with your AR 308 or you know whatever sort of setup and barrel length that you have you can plug it in there and so you can figure out where your actual drops are instead of what they're listed on here for their 62-grain 5 six out of a 20-inch barrels when I think they have it setup for it is of course a little bit more complicated than if the reticle is just set up for 308 to begin with but it is something that you can do if you're used to doing that or have some time to play around and plug in some numbers so overall really liked that part about it now let's talk about the last thing that really is kind of the make-or-break for a optic like this so that's going to be the glass clarity overall it's light transmission and its edge to edge clarity so let's go ahead and start with the worst offender of that and that is going to be the edge to edge clarity now when you're at 1x like this you are sacrificing a little bit just because of the limitations of the optic itself so at 1x you are going to get a slight fisheye effect around the edges of the optic so when you're looking through it at 1x especially at very close ranges like here in just a little room you're gonna notice that the edges really kind of blur and kind of work the edges a little bit the edges a little bit sorry and so at very very very close range like within 10 feet it can be a little bit difficult just because when you're moving the optic around it's going to kind of warp the hole in it now the center is very flat but the edges is where most of that warping occurs an accurate way to describe it is it kind of looks like you're looking through one of the original GoPros where it's very wide but it has that huge kind of fisheye effect to it it's kind of like that not quite as pronounced but you are definitely gonna notice that around the edge of the reticle at 1x on top of that at 1x it's actually very very zoomed out so it's not of course a true 1x there really aren't a lot of true 1 X's I've never actually seen one there is still some warping and adjustments of the edge of the image versus just your naked eye but this guy is actually very close so at a hundred yards you're getting ninety nine and a half feet of your field of view which is actually really good anything from a hundred two hundred and ten is really good anything above 110 is pretty much excellent and I don't actually know of any optic off the top my head that does anything more than 120 but a hundred for a budget or value optic is really good and a lot better than what you're going to be getting out of a lot of Cheaper or even some more expensive optics so 100 is really good anything above 110 is pretty much excellent and you're pretty much gonna be good to go with so 100 is definitely adequate and it's definitely enough it is still kind of a soft one so it's more honestly probably a one-point with a little bit of a fisheye effect on it and of course with that fisheye effect that one you do lose some image quality at the edges of the reticle itself or sorry not the reticle the edges of the optic itself so when you're looking through the glass you're not gonna have perfect edge to edge clarity now the color on there is really good it's really accurate in the center everything is very bright and crisp but you are going to lose some of that when you go onto the edges but when you take this guy out to eight which is of course its maximum magnification you are going to minimize the issues and the image becomes completely flat though you do still have some loss of clarity towards the edges though it's much more minimal and much harder to tell now when it comes to an 8 X versus a 6 X so I can 1 to 6 versus the 1 to 8 the 8x is definitely a lot easier as longer ranges for instance I took this guy out there with my 16 inch ar-15 which has a 1 to 6 on it and this guy here at 500 yards much easier much closer definitely much simpler to put it the dot exactly where I want it and take that shot so overall when it comes to image quality and clarity on here though you do lose something on the about the outer 10% of the edge of your image on the inner 90% which is the vast majority of it that you're going to be using it is very clear and crisp and I haven't had any issues with it it's very comparable with other budget or mid-range optics so you're definitely not losing a lot there it's just on the edges where you're going to have a little bit of a loss of clarity and that sort of thing and especially at 1x is gonna be a little bit more pronounced but generally through most of the other ranges it's going to be very very good now when it comes to performance on this guy I'm not to say that the lights satis efficient on this guy is very very good it is a fully multi-coated optic I believe it's emerald coating on this guy and it's really really good the color on it is very flat there's not really any tinting to it so at low light which is in the second half of the intro that you saw it was pretty much at dusk so the Sun was about to set pretty dark out and this guy here performed very very well at 1x pretty much it's almost exactly like a red dot just because that Center bright when it's dark outside is very very bright and very pronounced so it makes it very easy to put those rounds exactly where you want it so when it comes to light transmission I would say this guy here is excellent when it comes to optical clarity I would say that it is very good in the center about the center 90% of your image and you're gonna lose something on the outer 10% you're gonna get a little bit of warping at 1x as well so keep that in mind but overall the image quality on this guy I would say is very good not excellent not superb you're definitely not going to compare it to a high-end optic and say oh this is pretty much the same this is definitely does have some downsides you're gonna get that when you spend only 150 $200 on a one to eight but for what you get and what you pay for I don't think that there is anything that can beat it for that price point or even double that price point so I don't think you can spend three hundred three hundred and fifty dollars and get a better optic than this guy with of course the same capabilities of one two eight one last quick thing to mention before we wrap up this video is that I have taken these guys out on about a dozen outings or so and I have put hundreds and hundreds of rounds to them probably not a thousand yet but we are in reaching that point and they have function very very well they have not lost zero they're very easy to zero with different loadings especially taking out to longer ranges doing anything else you need to do with them so durability on both of these because I did buy both has been excellent on top of that utg does have a lifetime warranty so if you shoot this guy out and it breaks you can send it in and they will replace it for you for free so all that being said I'm gonna stick with it I think that this is the best optic for the money I don't think you can spend less money and get better I don't speak to think you can spend like two hundred and fifty three hundred dollars and get a better optic setup than this guy now you might be able to find some that are lighter something that does more for you but overall this package and the amount of capabilities and versatility that this guy has is excellent for the money and actually pretty excellent in general so that's pretty much it for the video guys those thank you so much for watching I hope you all enjoyed and I will of course see you guys in the next one peace off hey you yeah you what are you still doing here the videos over wires doing here like share ed subscribe or don't the choice is yours but if you do subscribe thanks ed I like pizza peace off we have two in the red one in the bottom so I threw too low on that one but this guy here both in the red", "rEXifo3mqYE": "hi my name is Evan English from Old English Outfitters today we're going to talk about how to read and understand all the numbers on the end of a shotshell box [Music] from the time I was about ten years old I was spending time in the field with my father I was also spending time in the store here learning about safety about the about the technical aspects of firearms so I kind of grew up in the field grew up in the store at the same time one of the things we love to do together was shoot shotguns whether it was out in the field hunting birds hunting game over our dogs or whether it was clay bird sports where we were shooting skeet or trap or sporting clays so as we did that I had to learn what the right things were and try to choose the right ammo for the tasks that we were about to do those numbers are important that we're about to decipher one to choose the safe load for your shotgun to make sure that you're doing the right thing based on the tolerances of your shotgun and the second is task-oriented we want to make sure that we're choosing the right shell to match the tasks that we're about to do whether it's a light target load for target sports or whether it's a heavier load for hunting game we're gonna make sure we're choosing the right amo for the task the first number we're gonna look at on any box of shot shells is going to be the gauge if you look at the gauge here this is a 12-gauge the most common gauges are ten gauge which would be bigger and then twenty 28 and 410 which should all be smaller easier to remember this that the larger the number the smaller the gauge the smaller the number the larger the gauge for the purposes of today we're going to talk about 12-gauge it is the most common gauge that we use here in the United States and chances are that most of you are using a 12-gauge at some point in time or another 12-gauge eni's this gauge needs to be matched up with your gun barrel somewhere on your gun barrel it should state what gauge your shotgun is if it's 12-gauge if it's a 16 gauge if it's a 20 gauge if any of these gauges you need to make sure it matches up with this gauge the second number that you'll see on the box is the length of the shell this is the length of the shell after it has been fired so as you're looking here at two and three-quarter inches if I were to pull one of these shells out that's part of this box of ammo two and three-quarter inches would be the measurement after this shell has been fired if you were to measure it empty comparatively the longest 12-gauge shot shell would be three and a half inches after its fired these are both the same gauge but very different chamber lengths you want to make sure that this matches up to your shotgun if your shotgun has a maximum chamber length of three inches then you can shoot up to a three inch shell in your shotgun you don't want to shoot bigger than that if your chamber length is two and three-quarter inches then this is the maximum length shell that you can shoot in your shotgun safely some people have argued that I can put a three-inch in my two and three-quarter inch chamber and that is true it will fit in there but when you fire it it will open into the forcing cone and cause extra pressure so make sure you match that number up the third number that you see here is the velocity the velocity that's on this particular box of shells is 1220 feet per second so that's gonna give you some idea of how fast that it is moving how fast it's moving its payload which would be the shot charge this is the next number but the velocity also gives you an indicator of of its overall power of the shell on some boxes you'll find a dram equivalent on this particular box of target loads you'll see a velocity here but then on this you'll see the DRAM equivalent DRAM equivalent is a kind of a throwback to the age of black powder a dram was one sixteenth of an ounce of black powder and it gave you an indicator when you looked at a dram equivalent to the amount of power or energy that that show was storing up we see it more directly related to the velocity these days than we do the overall power but it is a function of both of these numbers so that dream equivalent will help you a little bit but it does not tell you the whole story the velocity may tell you the next number that you find on this box is the payload or the shot charge the amount of shot that is in the shot shell these particular ones are one and a quarter ounces this target load that you see here is announced in an eight and if you were to take a magnum load in a three and a half inch turkey load you'll see that that is two ounces so comparing these three numbers ounce and a quarter ounce in an eighth this is about 10 percent 10 to 15 percent less however this is a much longer shell and it's a whole lot more almost double the target load another 30 percent 33 percent more than a standard field love these are important numbers the higher the higher the shot charge the more recoil on the backside where you're standing and also the higher the shot charge depending on what shot size you're using but also means more pellets going out the end of the barrel there's a good balance that has to be found here on shot charge because you want to make sure that you've got enough shot charge to do the job not too little not too much you don't want to endure a bunch of recoil this particular load would not be that fun if you were shooting 75 to 100 rounds in the Dubb field one day or shooting at clay Birds whereas a lighter shot charge might be much better for for us the way you don't need a lot of energy or a lot of shot and you want to be able to shoot a lot of shots without enduring a bruised shoulder the last number that you'll see here on the box is the shot size shot size is important because it tells you the size and somewhat the weight of the shot that you're shooting as we look at the shot size this one is they've given us icons that this is for hunting it's showing the pheasant a squirrel a rabbit so we know that this is a they've given us every indicator that this is a hunting load but many people don't know what those are as I'm looking at the this particular display I can see that it's showing me some some shot sizes going from trip alot buckshot all the way around to be be at the six o'clock position here and then wrapping back around up to the number nine shot back up here at almost 12 o'clock showing me the smallest shot most of your target loads are gonna be in this seven and a half eight nine shot most of your hunting loads for lead shot are gonna be in this 6 5 4 5 being a great balance between sixes which just got a little more shot and fours which gives you better penetration so that's kind of a ideal balance you'll see most hunting loads in this range twos fours bb's those you don't see a lot of those anymore because of changes in waterfowl hunting but these used to be very big for waterfowl hunting probably 20 years ago so if you look at these here you'll see that those are bigger these buckshot loads you'll find those used in defense loads or for something to reach out very far you won't find a lot of these in a shell so for instance a double-aught buck you might find nine pellets in a 12-gauge shell and those are what you would find in a say a defense loved this trip a lot double out there and the the 30 32 caliber range and and then these are much smaller diameter loads so coming back to reading the box where we started we've got the shot size and it's going to be based on what you're trying to accomplish with that shot shell will determine the shot size that you choose so in review coming back we've got the gage make sure that this matches up with your shotgun the chamber length also make sure that this matches up with your shotgun these are really important for safety you don't want to put a 20 gauge in a 12-gauge 12-gauge chamber it might go off it could cause a very unsafe situation the chamber lengths again make sure that the two and three-quarter inch will work in a three inch but not vice versa make sure that you're shooting the right length shell that is your gun is suited for it choosing the right power is important you want to make sure that you choose the right velocity the right power shell to go with your go with your task that you're trying to accomplish so this is a very task-oriented number also the shot charge making sure that you've got enough pellets going out the end some people like to get more velocity and less shot charge so these kind of bounce one another here and then the last number the shot size this won't make a difference for any of these others this only has to do with your intended use and that's how you choose the shot size one of the last things I want to dispel before we before we stop is the whole idea of high brass low brass the reason for high brass on a shot shell has to do with back in the days where shot shells were made out of paper and they had to have a higher brass on them in a higher power shell to make sure that the black powder didn't burn through the paper causing the shell to separate inside the gun today we do it still put the higher brass or the higher collar on the [ __ ] on higher power shells as a visual indicator and as a helpful note for those choosing the loads lower power would be lower brass or lower collar again not necessarily limit burn throughs but still important as a visual indicator and helpful to let you know which one to choose for what tasks well that's about it for today I want to thank you for joining us and for watching this video if you like what you saw leave us a like leave us a comment and subscribe to our Channel and come back and see

location I shot that pretty regularly they decided to close that location and they were getting rid of some of the flower / the cheapest I've ever seen and I'll show you the receipt here because like it's so cheap I got an ounce of flour you'll see on here 28 grams of a sativa dominant strain for 25 cents okay after-tax it's 27 cents for 28 grams that is less than a one penny per gram that is the absolute cheapest flower I have ever seen I mean it is so cheap I have to go back again they were doing a limit of one per day on the house and so I went back as many times I couldn't only ended up being 2 ounces but I got this for a basically the cost of a gumball and then an ounce of sunflower and it's not nice is definitely the best I've ever seen so we got two rounds this year we're gonna take a closer look at then we're gonna get into it here but I mean they're obviously if you're building the cheapest week you ever seen you're not getting rest you ever seen them but that is not gonna stop me from driving it up and letting on fire [Music] okay let's take a closer look at this [Music] and I've been on a CVD pretty quietly it's really nice to plant some CBD flower but this looks good I would buy this every time I saw it for a quarter even I mean this is not the everyday price but if they happen to the crazy sale like this was a basically giving it away I'm gonna go get it that one's the good meds and then this one in here is the Terps this one is a sativa dominant strain I believe it's higher in THC but it's also higher in Leafs and stems not bad died I would seriously buy this every time for that price oh you couldn't turn this down because you can do so much with an ounce of flower but I've got a few pieces out let's crack into this let's get some of this going [Music] okay I need you to drop a comment right now and whether you think I can or can not smash five bowls in a row I packed five and I'm just gonna do one take of this probably speeded up so comment now if you think that I'm gonna be able to all be able to smash five-foot-two Monroe [Music] [Applause] [Music] well I didn't I totally bought this as I thought like I would like it she did not I'm looking at the shape palettes somewhat appropriate um if you liked this video make sure to subscribe for more content in the future and for my live streams tune into my twitch channel at twitch TV / Cupid's I am live right now so tune in [Music]", "jih0XPo4aaI": "today we're going to look at what fluid ounces really means compare it to weight bounces we're starting with four different kinds of fluids and we have 8 fluid ounces of each of them we have water milk oil and juice you'll notice also that we've used different size of measuring cups so each measuring cup has a different capacity but they also have the exact same amount except for this little tiny one here this one only has capacity of one ounce so we need to fill it 8 times in order to have the same capacity as this cup that has a 2 cup capacity this cup that has a 4 cup capacity which is one quart and that one that has a 2 cup capacity a mm-hmm which is also a total of 16 ounces a day damage yeah ok first we're going to start with our water let's watch the weight as we pour the water in 8 ounces of water is the same as 8 ounces of weight pour out the water Oh next we're going to look at the milk oh now milk is a little thicker than water cuz it's a lot of damage because there's fat in it and other things and here we have more than 8 ounces in weight but it was the same amount weight and fluid ounces wait that's illegal next we're going to try juice mm-hmm and I need to put my 8 ounce in here so I have a total of 8 ounces of juice booger juice you are putting our 8 ounces of juice let's see that's also 8 ounces in weight yikes it's a little bit more to pour in the juice out wait how does that mean I just that weighed more than the milk that is completion maybe cuz there's sugar in juice laughs and now we're doing our 8 ounces of fluid ounces of oil and there are 10 wait what and now there's less than 8 ounces of wait wait if you've ever seen oil float on water this might explain oil is less dense than water so there's less stuff packed in there when it has the same fluid ounces you", "xSspjoM4Q-Q": "hi my name is Maria I'm a mathematician and today I'm gonna show you how many 1 eighths are in one quarter so what we're gonna do is actually divide one quarter by 1/8 to find out because if you want to know how many are in the other you have to divide them so I know that if I'm dividing fractions what I do is keep the first one change the division to multiplication and then change the last fraction so it's a reciprocal which just means to flip it around so the denominator becomes the numerator and the numerator becomes the denominator and now I go ahead and multiply straight across so 1 times 8 is 8 and 4 times 1 is 4 and now I can simplify that because I know that 8 divided by 4 is 2 so that means that there should be 2 1/8 and 1/4 and if we want to check that if that's true that should mean that 2 times 1/8 is 1/4 so to multiply these out I put 2 over 1 I get 2 times 1 is 2 1 times 8 is 8 and then I have 2 over 8 equals 1 over 4 which is true because if I reduce to eighths I will get 1/4 so there are 2 1 eighths in 1/4 my name is Maria and I just showed you how many eighths are in a quarter you", "JyEWRFAjwQo": "hi everyone its Daphne from scrap and create and I'm back to work on another mini-album and based on everyone's responses to the last video I'm going to be doing a larger scale mini album it's going to be 8 by 10 the outside dimensions will be 8 and a half by 10 and a half the inside pocket pages will be 8 by 10 and I'm gonna be working with the princess collection which is the latest release from graphic 45 okay page one we're gonna need two flaps they're gonna be a left hand and a right hand flap and they're gonna be installed on the top half of page one the bottom half is gonna be the pop flip mechanism that I've done before and that actually gets installed after we map this page so we won't be doing that right now we'll do that in the next video so you'll need two of these these are 4 inches by 8 inches and then you're going to score a half inch on either end and again they're going to get installed to the left and to the right and flush with the top of page 1 okay so I'm going to go ahead and turn my book sideways so I can see the very edge of my pocket page and I'm going to use a contrast sheet so this is the top and this is the outside that's toward the spine I'm going to apply my first flap right flush with the corner of page 1 okay and before I lay down the rest of my score tape I'm just making sure it's all lined up with the top of the page okay great that's in now I'm going to rotate it around and put in the second flap which goes just like this get my score tape off and page one is a mirror of page 8 so we'll do this again at page 8 and then these two flaps pretty much that's all we're gonna do for page 1 like I said and hell I'm just trying to make sure that I get it close to the edge of the page but steer clear of the hinge itself okay making sure it's flush to the top of the page before I lay down my score tape and it is okay that is it so I'll put my contrast sheet into here so you can see what I'm doing so we've got a a flap that opens to the left and a flap that opens to the right okay when it's closed it's going to be in this orientation so that the the top flap is closing away from the spine that helps with any possible interference and then I'm going to add a second magnet so I've got one here and do I have it in the right spot go do this there we go so I'm going to lay down a little bit of sticky tape the whole duct second magnet in place okay I'm gonna close my flap I'm gonna make sure it's all tight and even press down and then there we go okay so now my magnets are in place for when I finish the album actually it's gonna close that way because I want to close away from and because I want to do that I'm gonna change actually gonna change where I put my magnets I'm gonna put it on this end so here and that's because I want to close away from the spine take the extra tape off just gonna close like that and now I take this on the wrong side it's how it beer with me okay open that find the meat okay closing right flap pressing down and then there's my magnet and then I've got my tape over it to kind of soften the edges once I go back and put my designer paper in so that is the end of page one now we're off to page two page so on page two we've got quite a few things going on and as I had mentioned earlier in in the video there's actually four designer pages and they're going to be used twice throughout the album so page one will be page one and eight page two is going to be two and seven so we'll be working on page 2 which is again also page 7 so we're gonna start with a large flap it's going to be attached to the left side of the paper or left side of the pocket page it is 8 1 let me double check my measurements yes 8 by 10 8 by 10 and we are scored at the half inch mark on the 8 on the 8 inch side so when you're finished you've got a seven and a half by 10 that's going to be attached to the left side of the pocket page so I'm going to sit down we'll go ahead and do that [Applause] he's a fun page there's a lot of activity on this particular page which I like so I'm just lining up my corners as usual trying to get flush to the edge of the pocket page on the left hand side okay so we're down so that is the first part of page 2 and then the next part is we're going to have a flap at the top and then these two flaps which go left and right are going to attach to the top flap so I'm going to go ahead and put this down first and this is seven and a half by seven and a half so it's seven and a half by seven and a half and then along one of the sides you're going to score at half-inch and this is being applied directly to the flap that we just added so it's gonna go right on top I'm gonna turn it over so I can see my edges and I want to make sure that I've got a nice flush side here so I'm gonna put this corner down first and then carry it across the page making sure that everything is flush and this looks good I'm gonna press it down turn it right-side up this is the up side so now we have one flap and then a large flap okay and the next thing is we've got a left and a right hand flap and they're going to be attached to this top flap so I have a left and a right just like that okay and these measure double-checking eight by five and a half so this is five and a half by eight I'm gonna score a half-inch and you're gonna need two of those and I'm going to apply these toward the bottom of the top flap so instead of having it up at the top it's going to be applied to the very bottom okay and I'm gonna go ahead and apply the right-hand side first and so I'm looking to get a tight corner and have it go flush across the edge here okay one and you know two and I'm going to dry fit it because I might need to trim it a little so that it will close because one of these needs to be a little bit shorter than the other in order for it to close flush and it looks like I just need to take a tiny bit off this so I'm gonna do that right now and I'm just gonna use a ruler and a straightedge and I'm gonna just take a tiny bit off and I'm eyeballing it just enough to make sure that the flap will close flatly check it one more time lay this down and while I'm doing this I want to tell you one of the things that I try to do when I'm designing a page is if I'm gonna have a flap that opens I want it to open on the outside of the book and the reason I want that is because when you close the book there's less likelihood of the the flap catching the next page so it's something to keep in mind when you're designing your own albums and it looks like I got enough off so I'm going to turn it sideways take the tape off and go ahead and lay this down and again this is five and a half by eight score half inch along the e inch side yes and that looks nice so that is down and then our last piece is I don't have it marked but it's a pocket and it's actually going to get attached to this large flap and the pocket measures see three and a half three and a half by eight and a half so it's three and a half by eight and a half and then you're gonna score along three sides and then I just mitered the corners and I don't know why I don't have tape on it but I don't so I will in the interest of time I'm just going to put a little bit of glue on this one and I actually kind of like glue on pocket anyway this is actually gonna get attached to the top flap as well and as you can see it doesn't take very much glue and I'm using my art glitter glue as usual which is available in our shop at WWF and create calm and we carry the to the 4 and the 8 ounce and we also carry these tips that I use which I love because the other ones I always had trouble finding or not losing my my pin to keep it from clogging alright just trying to get my corners down actually quite at the bottom come in across Tiffin everything in there we go we've got a nice pocket and the pocket is it is pretty much right at the very edge of the flap so you can do two things one you can either put something inside lift the flap I'll put something inside or I think I left it short enough that you can also do put something in this way and this is what I'm planning on doing I'm planning on putting something in on top to actually hold the flaps in place instead of using magnets for a change okay so that is in and that is the end of page page 2 okay so you guys can see how that works so we've got a left and a right a top to bottom and then a large left flap and then lastly we've got this little pocket so that is page 2 but that will also be page 7 okay we've got a top flap and extended flap and a pocket we're gonna start with the top flap and that measures 8 8 by 5 and 3/4 8 by 5 and 3/4 and then we're going to score a half-inch along the 5 and 3/4 side and because this actually goes and 2 and meets the spine I've decided to do something a little bit different on this book I'm gonna trim this down a half inch so actually it's going to be 5 and 3/4 by 7 and a half I found that with the larger albums when I'm going to close there's some interference here at the spine so just like I did on this side I'm gonna give myself a half inch on the other side and so I'm gonna trim that off right now and I'm using this new trimmer for Martha Stewart which I picked up for a song and I have to say I really like it as far as having a portable I always like my cutter piller but it's really not easy to move it around especially when I'm doing a video and this has turned out to be a real dream I think Martha Stewart had something like this before and this is a new release of it and it seems to have worked out some of the books anyways I really like it pick it up at Michael's is that right Michaels or Joanne's either one it's $19.99 retail but you can pick it up with a coupon and it's really like I said it's a great deal so now I've got this half inch space between the spine the edge of the paper and the gusset and that way when I'm opening and closing I don't have to worry about any interference and catching the corner of this which I had seen in some of my other albums which is causing me to make this change and for some reason it's the bigger ones where it seems to to be a problem I don't think I've had that problem my apologies for shaking the camera I don't think I've had that problem with my 8x8 seems to be when I get to a bigger format I crapped before I was ready that's not straight alright so we are winding down here in San Diego the end of our Thanksgiving week and we had kind of a busy week he actually went out of town to visit some family in Texas and that was fun but it's always good to be home alright so that's that's in and that looks good so that's the top flap so I trimmed this a half inch like I said so it's seven and a half by five and three-quarters you're gonna score a half-inch at the five and three quarters side and this is an extension of that flap so when we're done it'll fold up and then fold up and I think on the larger format that just makes the book a little easier to handle instead of having a 10-inch flap but because I trim this down a half an inch I'm gonna do the same thing on here so it will be five it's a little bit smaller than this one it'll be five by eight there are five excuse me by seven and a half alright by seven and a half and what else does this and then you're gonna score a half-inch along with five inch side score a half inch along with five inch side and we're just gonna attach this flap to the bottom of this I'm gonna take my tape I'm gonna line it up with this flap and also the edge of the paper and hopefully when I actually should drive it at first when I Drive fitted everything will fit and nothing will be off the edge it looks like I've got a nice straight line down here and it's marrying up with the edge of the pocket pinch beautifully so it looks great one of the ways to make sure that happens is when you're trimming these two pages down lengthwise trim em stack them and trim them together and then you know you'll have you'll have shared edges and it should go in nice and straight so I'm doing is taking this corner the corner of the flap and attaching it to the corner of this okay and if you are familiar with my videos you've seen the same flap design in Christmas magic and I think it's actually if I'm not mistaken on page one and I'm just laying this down Oh carefully because of the size of the album there's a little bit of bow across the page right now so I just want to make sure I'm getting it down nice and straight and I am there we go so it's gonna look like this and then the last piece is this pocket which is gonna go on the inside and I designed the pocket to go the full length of the page because these were gonna go the full length of the page but now I'm rethinking that now I'm thinking I probably want to scale my pocket down a half inch just like I did these flaps and I'm gonna do that so give me a minute I'm going to go away make my new pocket and then we'll lay that down I'm back I took the original pocket and just trimmed it down a half an inch and then move my score line over a half an inch and now it's ready to be put down and that will bring us to the end of page three okay I'm just tucking everything over and there we go carrying my pocket okay so I'm going to line it with the outside edge of the pocket away from the spine toward the edge of the page well I got nice and taut get my fingers out and then yes so that is down so we're gonna go ahead and place a magnet here because I want that to help me keep the page closed and you just want to place it kind of in the middle of the pocket and the reason is you just want to stay away from any of the edges where it might be exposed after you put your mat in so I'm gonna make sure it's up high enough on this page as well and it may not be I may need to move that up we shall see now it's the time to find out though make sure it is closing straight everything looks beautiful yeah I think actually I think I want to move that in a little my should have placed the top one first so let me get some piece of tape I move it more toward the middle but not too far otherwise it's gonna be at the top of that really went in good using my pick tool to lift it I've got the sticky on the wrong side yeah it's fine there we go I want to put some tape over both pieces or both magnets I know it's time to put down oh I already did one trying to put down our mats it'll help smooth the edge of the magnet so it's not so harsh against the paper okay that is the end of page three now we're on to page four now we're ready for page 4 page 4 is going to be the same as page 5 like I said there's there's four designs and we use each design two times so four and five are gonna be the same there'll be duplicates only we're they're gonna be mirrors of each other so everything on page four is going to get or the beginning of it's gonna be attached to the left-hand side and then on page five we're gonna attach it to the right-hand side so when you open everything up it really expands and I chose page four and five the middle section to do that feature on so with that let's go ahead and get started there are several flaps there are two left-handed flaps and then there's a pocket that goes on top of the top flap and then inside we're gonna have some flaps that close or right-handed flaps that will open up so with that we're gonna go ahead and start with the large flap and this is 7 by 10 7 by 10 let me double check my measurements yes so we're going to score half-inch along the seven-inch side and that is going to get applied to the very edge of the pocket page and I'm dry fitting it right now to make sure that it's not going to hang off and that it's gonna marry up perfectly and it looks like it does so I'm gonna go ahead and take my tape off and lay this piece down again this is the large flap attached to the left-hand side of page 4 and it is 7 by 10 it's for a half-inch along the 7-inch side yeah get this down and then I'm gonna actually stand up so you don't have to look at the top of my head and see if I can get it to go legit so I can see all the edges or three out of the four edges get there right to the edge beautiful okay so that is in and all of these when I when I go back to double-check everything before I lay down my papers I'm gonna verify that all the edges are nice and crisp and burnish my tape if there's any chance of removing anything I don't want to press my tape down too hard or at least not with a bone folder okay so the next flap is also going to attach to the left hand side and it is going to go right on top of the top flap so when you're finished you'll have that one and flap - this is double-check my measurements five by ten five by ten and you're gonna score half-inch along with five inch side okay again five by ten or half-inch we're going to put it right on top at the last flap and that didn't look like I got right on the corner so I'm switch it around a little bit and I'm also going to find my contrast sheet which really helps me I try to always have one handy when I'm especially when I'm working on black mm-hmm okay go that looks good and then the next piece is going to be a pocket that gets applied directly to the top of the top flap and this measures five and a half by six and one eight five and a half by six and one eight and those measurements come from I'm actually gonna use a piece of ephemera here so when I was designing the book I always like to take into consideration the ephemera that I'm gonna be using so I usually take the f-number packs apart and check the sizes of everything and then I want to design at least some of my flaps features or pockets around the exact size of the ephemera and I I'm pretty consistent with that I do that in almost all my designs at least if it's a graphic album because they always have lots of goodies lots of extras that go with their own collection so it's not just the twelve by twelve paper as much as I love stamp Iria unfortunately they don't have any of the extras or rarely okay now this is just going to get applied directly to this flap and it should be flush on both edges it's just a nice little pocket that's gonna go top down so I'm lining up my corners but I'm stuck but it stuck to do this again I can see what I'm doing and you can - there must be some static in the air you tell me my papers going down before I'm ready for it Oh beautiful okay so that is a nice deep pocket that will put something in later so we've got a pocket a flap and a flap and now the last feature is going to be these two flaps that are going to be adhered toward the spine and so I want to go back and talk about something real quick so in this feature and these two features you know you can note that I stayed clear of the spine and I actually gave myself a half inch buffer and that's because these open these open away from the spine up and down or away from the spine but if your hinge is actually on this fine you don't have to worry about the interference so in this particular case I'm actually going to put these flaps directly next to the spine at the very edge of the pocket page so just so you know that's that's the thought process that's going on here if the hinge is toward the spine you don't have to really worry about interference but if you've got any edge that is not a hinge toward the spine you might want to consider giving yourself a half inch so just a design tip it's one of those things that the more you do the books and the more you move the flap so you become aware of some of those things so I can't remember how I designed this but I think yeah so yeah that's what it looks like so I think I designed it so that these flaps actually go flush with the edge of the page and then it leaves a half inch strip in the middle so with that tool kits I'm gonna go ahead and lay these down and these are 4 and 3/4 by 8 4 and 3/4 by 8 and you're gonna score a half inch along with 4 and 3/4 side no I'm sorry a half inch along the 8 inch side so when you're finished you've got a 7 and a half I've I'm actually going to go ahead and flip my book around so I'm not reaching over towards me and I can better see these this edge okay I'm laying down one corner and then I'm just making sure that it's flush with the edge of the page so lay that down okay so here we are okay so pocket flap flap and then two right-hand flaps and that is page four and it is also page five so we're going to do the same thing only we're going to flip it so that everything opens to the right and this all opens to the left okay let's go ahead and get started I've got everything pretty good there you go I think again seven check my measurement is 7 by 10 7 by 10 along with 7 inch side score 1/2 inch I please so I can see the edges and I'm gonna use my contrast paper there we go and the next piece is the flat that goes right on top same side and this is five by ten five by ten alright something pretty good it's tough when you're stacking that mini but it looks pretty good okay so the next piece is the pocket that goes right on top here mm-hmm just like this so it's gonna be flush with the edge of the pocket page as well as flush with the edge of this flap take my tape off and I ran glue along the bottom of this particular pocket that's really up to you you could if you wanted you could score three out of the four sides so this piece is five and a half by six and one eight five and a half by six and 1/8 and you're going to score half-inch on two sides and you're gonna do that along the five and a half inch sides so a five and a half you're going to score at half-inch and four and a half inches is that right a half-inch no a half inch and five half-inch and then five nothing would stay in my pocket if I did that and then these two pieces are gonna go this way and I'm gonna actually turn these down to a half inch so these are going to be 4 and 3/4 by 8 1 foot odor by 8 and that's just because I don't want any interference with with the hinge and then these are going to go toward the hinge and close across the middle okay so I'm just dry fitting these really quickly ok 4 and 3/4 by 8 4 and 3/4 by 8 you're gonna score 1/2 inch and do that two times you know score a half-inch along the 8 inch side and then you're getting it as close to the spine without going into the spine as possible to make sure it's actually didn't go down straight so I'm lifting it and then want it to be flush with the bottom there we go and oh you guys are in for a treat so this is the new collection the princess and I know I have a few fans out there and thank you so much for watching and tuning in but I also want let you know that Christine is doing one with the same paper collection - so you're gonna have two designers giving you two fresh pieces of inspiration on this brand-new collection so we're kind of excited about that and I don't have any idea what she's doing except I know she's not doing an eight-by-ten that's the only thing I know so we're trying to keep our project secret from each other and just see how they turn out I'm kind of excited to see hers we just got the paper off to her when she's over in North Carolina on Wednesday so she's usually pretty pretty fast on getting stuff designed and out for us so I'm pretty excited to see what she does okay these two are in and I'm looking at it and I'm not very happy with this because this page looks so much longer than this one so I think I'm going to go back in with a straightedge and straighten this up a little bit and make it and you'll see what I mean when I pick these two pieces to make it a straight a straight line that'll bother me once I'm once the designer paper is in especially if it's something light underneath so I will take a cut mat and go back in with my exacto knife and straighten that up but for now I'm happy with the edges this way so this is a fairly easy fix but I'll do that offline so you guys don't have to sit through it and we have just finished page five page four and page five so there's a lot going on in these two pages as you can see and they're going to need something to hold them down so let's focus on getting some magnets in to hold these two pages together so I'm thinking that I want a magnet on this page so let's go ahead and get a piece of tape ready I'm gonna figure out what I'm doing on one side and then copy it over so I know I need something on this side trying to decide to unwind on in here or yeah I think I do I think I want it in here when I say in here in here at the inside of the flap are these you could put it on the outside too and then I want it to hold this to this but ultimately I want it to go all the way down to the bottom so I think I'm going to put my other magnet right here so let's see I can get this figured out or if it'll go through this many pieces of paper even there is so that puts it new thought process I think I'm going to place the magnet here first there it goes okay he's like that doesn't want to grab it at all okay I think I'm gonna put it here and I think it needs to be over at least that far to grab this page yeah okay we're gonna go we're gonna try this okay it looks like that's going to hold so stop working turn it this way tuck everything in pressed and yes okay looks like that work okay and then I'm gonna do the same thing on this side let's see how far in I went except about three inches okay got everything chucked in both the flaps are closed so now there is a chance after we get all our designer paper on that it's gonna be too thick for these magnets to adhere through this page this page and to get to this because it'll also be under designer paper and if that's the case before I put paper down on this flap I may decide to add one more magnet and so you might have a magnet here here and here but if I can get away with just two magnets for these two pages that that's ideal so we're gonna leave it as is and just knowing that we might need to add a magnet okay page six now we're starting the process of duplication so we've already done these pages once like we did on page four and five and now we're starting to do the same pages so previously designed we're just adding them so this is the top flap the extended flap and then the pocket on the bottom and did I do this nope so these are all going to need to be shortened real quickly and I'll do that right now by half-inch so there's no interference with the hinge so when I'm done these will be a seven and a half by five and three-quarters one of them and the other one that's gonna be seven and a half by five so and a half by five seven a half by five and three-quarters the larger one is going to be the top flap and the smaller is going to be the extension on the top left so let's go ahead and get that started so at the top 5 in 5 and 3/4 by 8 scored at 1/2 inch by 5 along the 5 and 3/4 inch side so that's gonna go toward the top not a pick tool this is and I'm going to use my contrast paper I'm gonna bring this as you guys know I can't do this unless I flip it around because I've got to see all three sides okay this is going to go down toward the outside edge of the flap and then straight across so there you are so they're softer my top flap and the other thing you can do which I didn't even think of until just this moment is you could have attached these two flaps together before you laid it down there's some benefit to that I think it's kind of pros and cons um this way if you do it once it's in the book you can't verify that it's actually lining up with the outside edge if you do them before you put it in the book then you can make sure if they're straight down but then there's always a chance that they slightly go off the page or into the hinge so it's kind of a catch as catch can and the bigger your book the more bevel you have as you're working with it so it's just something to think about you can actually do it either way so this flap is going to get it adhered to the very edge of this flap and it is 5 by 7 5 by 7 and a half and you're gonna score a half-inch along the five-inch side and it's gonna get it here right to the bottom of this and our goal is to have it go straight here your eye will be drawn to the edge of the paper so you want this to be as lush as possible so I'm gonna lay down this corner first and then I'm going to bring it across and then I'll take my fingers out and press it down okay so it is very straight to the edge very flush along the edge that's what you want to see as much as you can get that to happen and then it's quite a flip and flip and then the last piece is a pocket and I need to shorten this real quick and add a new school running so we're gonna take a half inch off this way and then I'm gonna move my score line over a half inch is that right yep it's gonna be eight and I hate to have you on me now add a smaller score line so I've got two of the sides with tape I'll add a little tape here and then page six is just about done you know I hope you everybody had a good Thanksgiving like I said I'm excited about this new collection and I'm very excited to see what Christine does I know you guys really love our designs we always get so much good feedback and she really appreciates it and so do we so the next collection I think that we have out is the DCE the gentleman DCE so we'll be doing something on that fairly soon okay I'm just wanting to marry the edge of the pocket up to the edge of this page by contrast paper in here beautiful oh my is just line up just like they should okay now I gotta go back to page two because I can't remember no we didn't um actually it's page three okay I did put in a magnet in I had to go back and look at that so place it on the bottom first so it's not too close to the edge of the pocket and look at that there's already a magnet on the other side so it actually wants to find it and that's fine it doesn't have to be centered then we won't let go of me there we go right just line up yes it did okay that is the end of page six okay try to remember how I did it here we go okay so it looks like we're gonna start with one large flap and 8 by 10 8 by 10 it's going to it's going to be the mirror image of its mate and it's going to get attached to the right-hand side of the pocket page just lining up the corner and I want my page nice and flush if I can get that sure you guys can see that double check it again okay I just put down a contrast page as I was having difficulty distinguishing the edge of the pocket page from the the cover it all starts to look the same okay beautiful okay so we have a large pocket 8 by 10 score half inch along the 8 inch side and then we have a left and right flap that's going to be adhered I have to go back and look somewhere oh if you're to this so this is going to get attached to this flap this flap will get attached here and you know what I think I'm gonna do this a little on my constructors a little bit differently I'm going to attach the left and right flap to this and then attach this to the large flap so I'm gonna drive at this cuz remember one has to close over the other and still fit on this page so I'm going to dry fit it and figure out which one I'm gonna trim down a little bit if I haven't already I may have already done it it looks pretty close so I'm gonna go ahead and lay this down so for these flaps they are lining up with the corner and the bottom that's one and then the other ones can go this way and let's make sure when we close it it will close and be flush it looks like it okay so I think I must have trimmed one of these down a little bit prior not recalled the other thing that's nice about doing this outside of the book as if you go to close it in one of these is too long it's very easy to trim if it's outside the book it's in the book still possible it's just a little harder it's easier to see perfect perfect and it closes so that's awesome that is awesome and we are done with that okay so now this top flap so it's left and right I want to close this way because I really want this edge to be toward the spine now I'm gonna apply this directly to the top so I'm gonna go over those measurements cuz I'm not sure I did that while we were walking through this is seven and a half by seven and a half and you're gonna score half-inch along one of the sides these two flaps are five and a half by eight five and a half by eight and you're gonna score a half-inch along the eight-inch side so when you're finished you'll have a seven and a half by five and a half flap and then it is going to get attached to the right-hand corner of the pocket page and it'll be actually attached to this flap so I'm gonna rotate this around so I can see these three sides as I apply it and I'm gonna have to remember to turn this over to and then I'm going to tuck in my contrast sheet so I can see these two edges I'm looking to lay that down nice and straight and then there's one more feature on this page and it's a pocket or at the bottom there we go that that is in back around to the right side so I'm gonna walk through that again real quick so you have two five and a half by eight scored at a half-inch on the eight inch side I set my seven scored half inch on any inside since it's a square and it opens up and it's attached to an eight by ten flap and you're gonna score half-inch along the eight inch side so all of this looks really good although when I open it I see I've got a little bit of a tag here so when I'm going back and doing my detail work I'll probably I'll remove that tag because when it closes it still flush with the page it's just that little tag is sticking out so overall I'm very happy with how the pages come along and then there's one more piece and it is the pocket and it's gonna get applied right here and again I think what I'm gonna do is have an insert have sexually upside down have an insert that goes here that will hold these flaps down but when we get to a designer page if I decide I'm not happy with that or things don't slip in and out of this pocket easy enough then I may I may decide to add a magnet here and just to hold the flap down and then have whatever's in the pocket just inside this flap and I didn't do this on the first page but we're gonna leave a little tab on either side so that we can slip the designer page down I forgot to do that on the first one so I am probably gonna go back while the tape is still new and lift those two corners and put something under it so it's easy to maneuver later when I'm ready to do the designer paper and slide it underneath the pocket okay so try to remember to leave your two tabs on your pockets it's not the end of the world if you don't but it is nice to be able to tuck your designer paper slightly behind your pocket okay I'm lining up this edge and the bottom of the page pocket looks beautiful okay again I'm not sure if I'm going to use whatever's in the pocket to secure these flaps or add a magnet later but for now I'm planning on doing this but if it gets too bulky once I add the designer papers we might have to rethink that so for now no magnet but be prepared we may come back and add that okay that's just the end of page seven and so page eight is really simple because we're gonna do that pop flip mechanism that I did in my last album but we're not gonna construct that until we get the designer paper down so that'll be on the bottom half the top half is just two simple flaps left and a right and they are going to be moving one of them is going to be when you double check make sure you didn't shorten these I don't think I did I left them the full length yeah so it's going to be just like this which is page one so page one and page eight are the same I'm going to adhere one toward the spine and one toward the edge of the edge of the page it does look like I shortened it did I I did so I'm gonna knock uh [Music] looks like a half-inch off this let me double-check this my ruler yeah okay so these need to be four by eight four by eight shorten these by half in 4x8 there's for a half inch score 1/2 inch along the 8 inch side so the finished will be 4 by 7 and 1/2 in that way we don't have to worry about them getting stuck on each other ok so this is going to I'm gonna actually be apply this one first from the spine through the outside of the page I'm gonna use my contrast piece piece of paper here we're almost done with this page", "jnC6bbxiy8E": "what's up y'all welcome to another fast video of some CBD hemp flour today we're bringing to you dr. strange CBD if you are under the legal smoking age leave this video now anyway doctor uh dr. strange has got a strain called CBD dog it's a quarter ounce it's like seventeen percent CBD um but like 22 percent cannabinoids it's got oh I'm just kind of decent decent amount of cannabinoids in it this is $21.99 I believe but just the looks of these buds it's very nice just in the pack so we're gonna dive right into this review and you'll have a look at it good smell but

annal birdshot buckshot and a slug and what we're basically going to show is that I think birdshot is the best because it's not going to over penetrate but whatever gets it is going to get destroyed anyway but some people think that buckshot and slugs are better so they more lethal but they're going to over penetrate and possibly go through a wall or through a door so we've set up a mock scenario here's an inside panel door it's a hollow door pretty good pretty typical scenario you're going to be in a corridor we're going to shoot the target the watermelon here that's going to be center mass just flesh and body whatever it's going to get destroyed we're going to see if it's going to go through the target and hit a watermelon on the other side we're going to be using the Remington 870 optical with an 18 and 1/2 inch barrel first up is challenger number seven and a half birdshot here we go you Oh messy alright so as you guys can see the watermelon or your intruder he's totally destroyed but if you take a close look at the door not a single pellet actually even touch the door and auntie or granny sleeping on the next side and the other room she's perfectly fine no damage so that's a success let's move on to the next test buckshot alright so for the second test we're going to be using Remington 2 and 3/4 buckshot this is extremely high velocity see how that goes you awesome alright so that was the second shot with the Buckshot completely different story the target is equally destroyed there's really no noticeable difference there but if you take a closer look it completely went through the watermelon or your intruder completely went through this hollow panel door I see light on the other side so ooh that's bad granny sleeping she's not waking up from that one so look here oh yeah completely Oh completely destroyed all right so we're on to the third test we're going to use high brass high velocity two and three-quarter inch one ounce slug you take it right holy [ __ ] any telling exploded better than the line alright so that was the slug and as you can see it was the most devastating by far you could tell by the footage so your intruder is completely destroyed but it went clean through the watermelon clean through the door and we got the other watermelon here granny would not have liked that very much let's crack her open see if we can find that slug a hole like that Wow pieces of the door there's peace of wadding alright so in conclusion so as I suspected I personally think that birdshot is really the best for home defense simply because it's not going to over penetrate go through walls go through doors and possibly hurt or kill somebody in the next room but the target or the intruder is still going to be completely destroyed buckshot it penetrates goes through the door goes to the wall no problem and the slug is even worse so I hope you guys learn something maybe that will change how you feel about home defense or what you're going to use leave your comments let me know what you think after watching this you", "URcUvFIUIhQ": "Hey, this is Presh Talwalkar. What is the value of this mathematical expression? This math problem has gone viral and it has received millions of comments on Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, and other social media sites. In this video, I'm going to present the correct answer. The problem is an example of the order of operations. These are commonly refered to as PEMDAS or BODMAS. This refers to evaluating the parentheses/brackets, then the exponents/orders, Then multiplication and division And finally, addition-subtraction. You have two operations of the same precedence, you want to evaluate them from left to right. The first of the problem has no controversy. This expression contains a parenthetical expression which must be evaluated first. 1+2 is inside the parentheses, so we'll evaluate 1+2 to get 3. Now, the question is what to do next. If you this into google, wolfram alpha, or pretty much any scientific calculator, the thing that's going to happen next is all of these will interpret the parentheses as an implicit multiplication. So this two parenthesis three will be converted into 2 times 3. Now we continue the order of operations. This expression only contains multiplication and division, These are operators of equal precedence, so we'll evaluate them from left to right. Starting on the left, we have 6 divided by 2 6 divided by 2 is equal to 3 We then have 3 multiplied by 3 - one final multiplication. And that gets us to the correct answer of 9. This is, without a doubt, the correct answer to this expression as written according to the modern usage of the order of operations. So why did this problem cause so much controversy? Well, there is another answer that you could argue from a historical perspective, so I actually found some documentation that the order of operations did have a slightly different understanding in certain texts in 1917 or before. So the first part of the equation is the same as before: we have a parenthetical expression and this should be evaluated first we have 1 plus 2 and that becomes 3. The debate then centers around this division symbol. So what does it mean that we have 6 divided by 2 parentheses 3? While there were textbooks and there was a lot of usage that if you had this division symbol where you had something on the left divided by something on the right, this was understood to mean you want to divide the entire product on the left by the entire product on the right. So, for example, if a textbook wrote \"x divided by 2y\" with this division symbol they actually did mean x divided by parentheses 2y. You wanted to take 2y as the entire product and have that as your denominator. So under this historical usage - which is a special exception to the order of operations (and we don't use it anymore) - you would want to take this product on the right as your divisor. So applying this rule would then lead to the expression 6 over 2 x 3. We will now convert the multiplication in the denominator so that 2 times 3 is equal to 6 and we now have one division which is 6/6 and that's equal to 1. So, many people argue that one is a correct answer, and there is some historical justification of this because of the way that texts used to use the division symbol. I would suggest this is probably because of some historical artifact about typesetting: it would have been much easier to write the division symbol and have the understanding you want to divide everything on the left by everything on the right; you wouldn't need to have an expression where you write a numerator over a denominator that would take a lot more vertical space and you also would need to keep putting parentheses everywhere. This would be just something that would be understood. Today we don't use this practice, because it can be confusing. Instead, we follow the order of operations. If we want to have a fraction, we will put it as an expression like 6 over 6 which is written here. So the correct answer to this problem is 9, but there is some historical justification for the answer 1, but it's not how we'd interpret the problem today. Did you get to the correct answer of 9?

bore choke and I was using the number 4 shot not to be confused with number 4 buckshot but the 2 and 3/4 inch shell you can see the velocity it's 1 and 1/4 ounce as a payload and here is the payload approximately 125 to 130 pellets and you could convert that number 4 over to a caliber it's coming in just over 13 so get that in the reflection 13 caliber and if you move up to number 4 buckshot you're looking at approximately 27 pellets and roughly 24 calibers so smaller payload as far as number of pellets but a lot bigger and that's probably used more for home defense than this would be this is typically a field load used for small game birds and so forth I've had to use this in the backyard unfortunately for rabies a rabid animals we have a run of rabid raccoons and skunks and they will come out in the bowl today they are obviously sick they'll try to get into the house and the garage and there's somewhat aggressive so I've had to use this to humanely put them down from a distance and I found it to be quite effective now we're looking at this today because some folks might want to consider something smaller or not as powerful as buckshot for home defense because of fear of over penetrating walls and so forth so this is what it does set roughly ten feet on a one gallon water jug to be expected you have a lot of energy going out there this is from three to five feet so it opened that up now if you're being attacked by a highly caffeinated mr. coffee maker then I think you're gonna be in good shape you pretty much split this in half let's move over to the steel and see what kind of pattern we had at distance this plate is 12 inches in diameter a r500 steel 3/8 of an inch thick and it weighs about 12 pounds that shot was from 30 feet really good coverage at that distance miss my foot a couple of IPSC targets hits on the side this is 24 inches by 18 inches you can see the coverage there and on the second one more center mass on that and I backed up on these by the way this was at approximately 15 yards 45 feet and pretty good coverage on this sized target at that distance and this is what you wanted to see a block of the sim test calibrated to match the specs of 10% ordinates gel weighs 50 pounds 22 inches in length I have not been using denim for shotgun tests so it is absent again today I'll be shooting this from a distance of 10 feet and I'm hoping to get at least 10 to 12 inches of penetration out of a majority of the payload as a point of reference I was holding on the center of the block where that florescent meets to black on the front post let's back up and take a quick look at the front because it did go a little bit low there might be a few pellets that try to exit out of the bottom of the block but that is a very nasty point of entry from 10 feet for now I've just split this into two halves you can see on this half the plastic wad penetrated about four inches I don't know how realistic that's going to be in real life and to what extent that plastic wad caused this inch and a half diameter opening we have here and even more so over here I do think that the pellets obviously caused a lot of lot of damage to this speaking of pellets I'm seeing most of these from this perspective in the six two eight and eight and a quarter inch range I can see several through here in this area I can feel them underneath and see them underneath the top layer of the block but generally six up to about eight and a quarter inches from this perspective what I'm going to do now is just make a cut right down the middle of this and see if I can get some more pellets in this area and if we can pick up some deeper penetration and then we'll wrap it up working along the core of the shot path I made some additional cuts including some cross sections and confirmed that the maximum penetration on this is going to be around eight to eight and a quarter inches with the majority of the shot stopping between five and a half and eight inches I think that's a good thing as far as the pattern itself now this is all cut to pieces of course but the frontal area of the block was originally around 48 square inches and at 10 feet I think we captured a high percentage of the payload in that area that will be confirmed once I break this block down into smaller pieces melt it and then pour the hot liquid through the strainer where it will be recast in this case for retirement this is the last time you're going to see this particular block I've been using it since February 2011 have a fresh batch of sim test in the house it's gonna be lighter in color as we get started but it's calibrated so don't panic now with regard to this particular test if you can go with buckshot if you can handle the recoil and if your living situation permits that I would gravitate toward the buckshot however if you were extremely concerned about over penetration I do think this is a better option than birdshot and therefore it could be a good choice for you not the best but it could be effective thanks for watching you", "IrvEHVn-fks": "How many ounces are\nin 6 pounds? So we have 6 pounds\nand we need to convert them to ounces. And if you don't know it\nalready, you'll know it now, that there are 16 ounces\nper pound. So what we want to do is we\nwant to have pounds in the denominator. It's in the numerator\nright now. So we want to divide by pounds\nand multiply by ounces. Maybe I'll write it out. And I just told you\nthat there are 16 ounces for every 1 pound. So if we multiplied these two\nexpressions, this pounds will cancel with that pounds, and\nwe'll just be left with the unit of ounces, which is what we\nwant, and we just multiply 6 times 16. So it works out unit-wise, and\nit makes sense as well. If we have 16 ounces per pound,\nand we have 6 pounds, we just have to multiply\n6 times 16. That'll be the total number of\nounces we have. So this is going to be equal to--\nwhat's 6 times 16? So if you take 16 times\n6, 6 times 6 is 36. Carry the 3. 6 times 1 is 6, plus 3 is 9. So 6 times 16 is 96. You have this divided by 1 here,\nbut that's not going to change anything. And then all we're\nleft with in the dimensions are the ounces. So 6 pounds are 96 ounces.", "LD39tSKFUhE": "how's it going YouTube and welcome to the high life today rollin the 8th joint because I think his name is ice he's asked like three or four times so this

quality measuring spoons and cups you don't need too fancy or expensive ones just simple basic and easy to use here's what every home cook should have measuring spoons liquid measuring cups and dry measuring cups let's talk spoons first they come in graduated sizes that include 1/8 teaspoon 1/4 teaspoon 1/2 teaspoon 1 teaspoon and 1 tablespoon measuring spoons work for wet or dry ingredients to measure a dry ingredient dip in the spoon and level it off with the back of a knife to measure a wet ingredient hold the spoon level and pour in the liquid until the spoon is completely full next our measuring cups it's a good idea to have 2 different types of measuring cups one for liquids like milk water or oils and another set for dry ingredients like flour or sugar the basic measuring cup for liquid is usually clear and has measurement printed on the side this type of measuring cup also has a handle a pouring spout and plenty of headroom in case ingredients expand the most useful measuring cups are heat proof microwave safe glass or hot ingredients as well as cool to read a liquid measure accurately put the cup on a flat surface and bend down so you can see the measurement at eye level sticky thick liquids like molasses honey or corn syrup are measured best by wiping down the inside of the cup or measuring spoon with a little oil or butter before you pour the thin coat of grease helps it pour out again easily and completely for shortening scoop it out of the container and press it into the cup or spoon to force out any air bubbles or pockets then level it off and four stick butter just measure using the increments marked right on the paper wrapper slice off what you need don't be tempted to pour ingredients into your measuring cup or spoon while holding it over the top of your mixing bowl it's too easy to accidentally spill in more than you need now let's measure dry ingredients dry measuring cups are different from liquid cups and common sizes for 1/4 cup third cup 1/2 cup and one cup to fill the cup use the dip and sweep method for dry ingredients such as rice or granulated sugar just dip and fill the cup then sweep level with a knife flour and powdered sugar take a little extra finesse white and whole wheat flour is easily compacted so it should be stirred first then spooned into the measuring cup and leveled off powdered sugar needs to be sifted in order to remove lumps before measuring brown sugar has more moisture so pack it firmly into the measuring cup or spoon before leveling with the knife also pay close attention to how our recipe is worded if it says one cup sifted flour make sure to sift the flour first and then measure one cup 1 cup flour , sifted measure it first and then sift it it's always a good idea to follow the recipe the way it is written the first time you try it then improvise later when you're familiar with how the ingredients all come together with inexpensive and basic measuring spoons and cups you can measure

get started first let's make a soup base I'm going to use this Korean Stone part it's actually ideal pot to use for this dish but if you don't have it don't worry you can use regular price no problem just make sure your pot has a thick bottom we are going to add one cup of Korean ultimate stock and I have a recipe already the link is down below and check it out you will need two and a half cup of broth total for this recipe but I'm going to add 1 cup first to dessert my shaving paste in here and a three and a half tablespoons of Koreans living paste and whisk soybean paste with the froth until you can see a big chunk of it and the rest of the crowd which is one and a half cup let's bring this soup to boil meanwhile we are going to prepare the best of us the vegetables I'm using today is totally my personal favorite and actually those are basic for tangent again first Korean squash it's almost like zucchini but it's a little bit more sweeter side cut into poorer I think what a slice and next mushrooms my all-time favorite is oyster mushroom for Tenjin jjigae but obviously you can add any type of mushroom they like I'm just tearing my oyster mushrooms in back sizes tiful I'm using medium form to food I recommend the medium form to form to food for this recipe you will need 8 ounce of - food it's about 1/2 block I'm going to cut my tip about 1/2 inch cubes into green onions and last Chili's if you like spicy if you don't you can skip it but I definitely love spicy you love spicy foods right you need 1 green chili but our 1 green and red both I'm gonna use 1/2 and 1/2 since you like my soup is boiling now and let's add a 2-foot mushrooms and zucchini first be careful not to splash your soup we are going to bring back to boil over high heat Clinton ticket is a Pago Pago Pago boiling now I'm going to add green onions and the chilies on right on top and turn off the heat right away because green onion and chili does need to be cooked be careful this is very very very nice and this is why we are using stone part because after we moved from it they are still boiling and this is how we like our ticket this same tactic component suit from Korea oh yeah you've got to

ingredient the kitchen scale I have two types here a regular scale and the tea scale if you are new to weighing your ingredients start with a regular scale it works for all measurements that are not completely tiny basically it's a replacement for measuring cups and the tea scale is a replacement for measuring spoons there is no math involved with scales they all have a tear or zero button so you can set any Bowl on top zero it out and add your ingredients most scales let you choose the measurement unit so if your recipes and grams set it to grams and if it announces set it to answers the reason small quantities like salt are usually given in grams is to avoid hard to read fractions 1 gram is easier to read and write then 0.035 of an ounce of course you can weigh all your ingredients but the one that needs when the most is flour in the u.s. most people use dry measuring cups for flour let's see how well that works here is one cup of flour it weighs 164 grams and here is another cup of flour and it weighs 138 grams flour is a powder so it's compressible here is how the first cup was measured don't laugh I used to measure that way at some point that's the wrong way kids and here is how the second cup was measured I moved the flour into the container fluffed it up scooped it gently and leveled that's the right way let's do it again the right way to see how well that works 149 grams last time I got 138 grams so even the right way is not that a cure how much flour you get when measuring with cups can vary by as much as 20% depending on the container the cup how much you stir and the humidity conditions but what if your grandma didn't write you her chocolate chip cookie recipe in ounces or what if your favorite magazine is stuck in the dark ages using cups in cases like that assume that one cup of all-purpose flour equals 5 ounces 142 grams and those chocolate chip cookies will come out perfect every time now let's talk about flavor problems when the big goods are lacking in flavor people usually blame it on the quality of butter flour or eggs but the real culprit is usually the wrong amount of salt if your baking recipe does not specify the salt type they mean table salt the difference between salt types can be huge for example 1/2 teaspoon of table salt equals one teaspoon of diamond crystal kosher salt the difference between the measuring spoons can also be huge this is always 1 teaspoon in the US and this is also sold as one teaspoon let's see how similar they are I know I spelled a bit but we're not even close here so make sure to buy deep round teaspoons or get yourself a tea scale one teaspoon of table salt weighs 5.7 grams liquids can be weighed but can also be measured by volume since they are not compressible set a liquid measuring cup on a level surface and make sure the bottom of the meniscus is at the line to which you are measuring also make sure your eyes are level with that line oh it will be hard to judge the amount for

is Monique and I'm so excited to show you today a really cute cupcake decorating project we're going to be making these fondant beaver cupcake toppers they're so cute now I know what some of you might be thinking fondant I've never worked with fondant before impossible skip but wait before you go let me truthfully tell you that this was my first time ever working with fondant first time this is it I even instagrammed it because look how cute they turned out and I'm telling you that yours are going to turn out just as cute when you follow these easy steps so are you ready let's decorate we'll start by getting our fondant ready first roll out your fondant mat now the great thing about this mat is that it's already prepped for you to use you just roll it out roll your fondant on it cut out your pieces and that's it if you don't have one of these mats you can certainly use either your kitchen table or your countertop really any smooth clean surface and you can sprinkle some powdered sugar on it or some vegetable shortening so that it doesn't stick to the countertop so we're going to be using different colors for the beaver but we're going to start out with a dark brown color this is going to be for his head and for his ears so when you first take it out of the package it's already pretty soft to begin with but you're still going to want to knead it a little bit so think of it like a stress ball just give it a couple of squeezes but who could be stressed when we're decorating I mean look at this cute little guy we're going to be making no stress guys next we're going to roll out our fondant using our fondant roller use the pink guide rings on the fondant roller because it's already measured out to a specific height so all you have to do is roll out the fondant and it's going to turn out perfectly smooth and the perfect thickness to put on top of your cupcake so you're going to want to roll out the fondant wide enough so that you have enough space to cut out the head and two ears we'll start by cutting his head using the circle cookie cutter and then for his ears you're going to use the narrow end of tip 1 a 1 now from your leaf double-cut outset we're going to use see we're going to use the smooth side there's a rippled side and the smooth side but just make sure to use the smooth side so now we're going to cut one and the other from your oval cut outset we're going to use cut out F and we're going to use the smooth side just like we did with the whiskers because it also has a rippled edge but make sure you use the smooth edge for his nose well sometimes they stick right to your cutout but that's fine because you could just pop them right out for his eyes we're going to use tip 1a again the narrow side and just set these guys aside with the others now this one's a little bit different because we don't have a exact cut out to cut out his teeth so they're gonna have a little character to them because you're going to cut them out yourself just using a fondant Knight now you know what a Beaver's teeth look like they're a little wider at the top and narrower down at the edge just cut that shape out just how you would imagine those teeth to look like so we're also going to use the white to just roll out his little pupils for his eyes so you could just take two little pieces from your white fondant and just roll now that we have all our pieces cut we're going to assemble our beaver we're going to need a glass of water and a decorating brush to attach all the pieces together we'll start out with his teeth so we have to make it look more like teeth so use your toothpick to make just a line down the middle to make it look like it's two separate teeth where it's your buck teeth next we're going to work on the whiskers to add the details of the hair we're going to use a toothpick to scratch some details onto the surface so there you have your little whiskers or a mustache whatever it is beavers have whiskers or mustache I don't know let me know we'll start with the left sides when you position it make sure that the thinner side is twitching up like a mustache so now we'll just keep moving our way up so next is his nose brush a little bit on the back and then position it just above his whiskers okay so next are his eyes so just attach them like we've been attaching all the other pieces oh he looks cute so now we're just going to attach his white pupils and give them that kind of starry-eyed look so we're going to attach the ears just a little off-center from the eyes so now that he's all assembled we just want to set him aside a bit so he could dry and firm up a bit so it's easier to place on the cupcake now we're going to prep our cupcakes we're going to use some white icing with a tip one M to create a 1m swirl oh look how cute he is see I told you you guys can do it now if you want to learn how to make the squirrel or the skunk check out the link below and if you have any questions leave me comments

in the first one they're asking how many Ounces are in a certain number of pounds and in the second one we're doing some subtraction which can get a little bit tricky the key fact you need to know is how many ounces are there in a pound and if you don't know it's 16 so 16 ounces equals 1 pound actually I guess we say lb for pound and what I like to do is write this as a ratio a special kind of ratio that people either call a unit multiplier or I like to call a conversion factor and you can write this ratio in either of two ways you could have pounds on top one pound is 16 ounces or you could have 16 ounces on top and one pound on the bottom and in various situations you might need to use one or the other when you convert from one unit to another what you do is you multiply by a conversion factor by a unit multiplier so what we're starting with is 4 pounds I'll put the unit's in there and I like to write this as a fraction so I just put a 1 on the bottom that's the same thing as 4 pounds but I've put it in the form of a fraction because I'm going to multiply it by another fraction now which one of these do I pick to multiply to convert this into ounces the trick is that you want if you have pounds on the top to begin with you want pounds on the bottom in your unit multiplier so I'm going to choose this one so I'm going to multiply this by 16 ounces on the top and 1 pound on the bottom the reason I want pounds on the bottom is because I want to end up with ounces that's what the question says how many ounces when you have pounds on the top and pounds on the bottom you cancel those so those units cancel out and what you're left with after you do the math is just ounces now I simply multiply these fractions 4 times 16 on the top one times one on the bottom so let's see 4 times 16 what is that 64 and one on the bottom I could write 64 over 1 or I could just leave it as 64 it's 64 ounces that how many Ounces are in four pounds this next one asks us to subtract 216 pounds three ounces from a hundred and seventy three pounds or minus 173 pounds 14 ounces so I'm going to write it out like a traditional subtraction problem here 16 pounds three ounces on the top minus 173 pounds 14 ounces here now when I start this I start here with the ounces and what I notice is I have three ounces minus fourteen ounces and just like in regular subtraction if the number is smaller here I have to borrow from the next unit over while the next unit over is in pounds and I'm going to take away one pound from that 216 that makes this 215 and I get one pound over here but I need to convert it to ounces before I add it in so I don't put a 1 here what I put in is a 16 plus 3 so really this is 19 ounces now minus 14 ounces while 19 ounces minus 14 ounces is 5 ounces so that worked out now we can continue on with my subtraction 5 minus 3 is 2 1 minus 7 I have to borrow again so that becomes a 1 I put a 10 really or you know a 1 in front of the 1 that becomes 11 minus 7 that's 4 and then 1 minus 1 is 0 so it's 42 pounds oops and 5 ounces", "xQMI2Z32chk": "Arnold Schwarzenegger (Minecraft Steve): It's a bomb! *Explosions* Thank you for coming to my

cheddar okay [Music] I knew who's been in there for what like maybe four minutes yeah make sure do your noodles you want to make sure that they or that didn't take you don't want to live a poem cuz they're gonna cook in the oven - all right so this is this little piece of I'm gonna leave this because I don't want my nose gone about you on it either unlikely you start looking your lips so I cut up all the cheese's i'ma set these two to the sack cause I want to make our cheese sauce now how salted butter you sold the butter but you know you just make sure you taste these if you're not make it something salty all right so just another they have a stick of butter down now that's nice and bubbly smells like something is burning up in here so you just want to mix that in your butter and I got this in the wrong hands so it's like really awkward this is gonna make the cheese sauce stick some and then some regular 2% mote just using a cups to start off with and I'm just more gradually it more dependent on the texture I like I don't like it like I like it's in because when you put them TVs in there it's going to start picking it up and I don't like that really sick texture like that so I'm just going to add regular 2% milk slowly according to the texture done before I think in the West because he was like really thick and it was this funky enough one that's good cuz I just got a whiff in his skin too [Music] all right so this cheese sauce is the texture I would like but I haven't added the cheese in yet so I'm gonna add some cheese in and then I may need more milk and I go along so I'm gonna go ahead um some sharp cheddar cheese in make someone looking here send it out a little bit so I'm just gonna taste it and see what that's pretty good I'm ask more cheese we gave more of a cheese flavor and I don't want to use all of it so this is real and spits it I probably used about eight and is maybe houses a sharp cheddar cheese two cups evaporated milk and 2% 2% more I'm gonna whisk this down and I already drank my noodle so I'm just going to it I got to UM think it's tablespoons of butter thanks how many my video I forgot to pay the ad so afterwards and so I'm gonna make sure in and out [Music] and this is the pending you know that we cook the news and so I'll be looking like I'm dirty I'm just the same the same pot so here's the cheese sauce I'm gonna dump that up in here mix this up and see how it's thick this is this is where I was trying to prevent I let it sit a little bit but I'm gonna just let it just be expand as this I'll find out I got these from Amazon and so I will leave the measurements in the description box to where you know where you can purchase them alright so I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to first our spray the little bit olive oil in the pan so I want to take some of this mixture and just pour one into the bottom of here one layer and then we're going what we're gonna do is gonna take some cheddar cheese I have here don't just put that all in there that's the thing when you do grilled cheese it's like a lot thicker in some areas like this comes together so I'm gonna take some merrill cheese and so I'm a little taking my short cuz I'm gonna use that for the top I'm just gonna take something a mixture of cheese wherever she should go okay well mix that all together all right so my son took some of this drew we're not mix a I'm just gonna poke something take some more it's like the rest of it I'm gonna smear that across here take some cheese and take someone to smile chatter white cheddar sprinkle it all across the top my Italian cheese taking all the cheese's I have left except for the sharp because I want to have a sharp to keep the top I'm gonna Kappa mm-hmm really good soon all right so I'm just going to take this and poke again three burnout mixing it through just poke in this three I think it's just so thick so I get stuck on that spin but just swipe it off with your finger keep it moving keep going just get it make sure you get all spots cover it want some people again cheese make sure yep like I reason that's that so now I'm since I put that room just gonna take my sharp cheddar cheese I'm just going to cover the top you saw that cheeks uh-huh a lot of cheese it was that you want a good my friend cheese you want me Blanche eat my ran me won't get somebody something soccer go you bring it to the cookout again see you part the macaroni cheese Oh [Music] alright so that's that so I'm going to spray the top and then I'm gonna look more pepper on the top just sit just a little bit wrinkled alright so that I have a preview oven preheat the oven to 400 degrees so that's already ready and then we're going to put this in the oven for uncovered for about 20 to 25 minutes alright so the back for any of cheese just came up the oven it's been in there for 25 minutes on 400 degrees you can see the top looks very Brown looks good looks delicious I'm gonna let this sit for about five minutes 5-10 minutes and then we're cut into it and see how it looks so just go digging to see how the texture looks in the inside [Music] these stinky cheese looks good how can I just see how how good it is listen that's it yeah it spiked my heart I'm not trying to burn my muffin just not bring yes I can't even pick it up baby I'm gonna spin around [Music] thank you for watching scrap before you leave and I guess I'll catch you on the next video bye", "v054wvlbTgo": "hello my name is Bruce Cheaney I would like to demonstrate to you how to silver solder two pieces of steel they're a quarter inch thick by one inch wide just little pieces that I've cleaned put a little shampoo on and basically I want to demonstrate to you how I silver solder two pieces of metal like that together I'll be using the Harris products 45 percent safety seal 1/16 inch bracing wire and the flux I'll be using is safety stay sealed and it's also made by the Harris company it's a white brazing flux and that's what helps bond the two together so let's get started here this is the corner of my workbench where I do a lot of my soldering for the handmade items up making this is my two pieces of steel that I have prepped they're quarter-inch stick actually these are that's a little more likely inch and a quarter in width but that'll work just fine for this demonstration got a little chamfer on those and they're belt set in clean and you can actually but it right up to each other you can move it back a little bit so I'm just put it right close to each other right like that and that's what I'll saw her together with the Harris 45 percent silver solder okay I've got my parts going already and it's a victor tarts it's a small one with the heating tip on it in some cases you'll need a bigger heating tip but what I'm doing right now is putting the flat pace flux on to the steel where I want the silver solder to flow as I mentioned this has been cleaned with a belt sander right up to the edge what I want to solve and it's good with plenty of flux on there so that the Queen wanted to do and this is what the silver solder wire looks like I'll snip off a piece long enough to do flame what I'll do is hold the silver solder wire my left hand there and what I'll do is I'll heat the back end of it get the metal hot towards the back and then I'll apply heat towards the seam that I want to solve it kind of work it back and forth like that and it said both pieces of Steel need to be hot the Harris products are really good for soldering and I highly recommend on my views the Harris silver solders for over 30 years public okay I'm getting some heat built up on my piece and then now I can kind of go towards the center and one thing you want to keep in mind is not to burn your  so if it turns black it will not be effective so right now I think I'm about ready here I'm gonna start on this side here my middle that it's a dull red until it's ready to flow I'll just slow that sort of right down on there and just stop like that you know turn that over there'll be some cases where you will not be able to flip your piece over and you'll just hit the solder from the top and back pretty much assure you that there is a good fat sealer and just right there just get off of it just like that you can spray a little bit trim it off depending on your metal though because just like if it's cast iron you you get the let it cool it off naturally and real slow if it's a mild steel or some kind of carbon steel it can well cut a carbon steel I let it cool off slow also the hot roll or a coal row you can go ahead and cool it off that is a good tight bond all the way around that piece of steel right there you", "Eal8f-IHDDc": "[Music] hello friends it's miss cheryl from warren newport public library welcome to kids in the kitchen today we're going to make festive scalloped corn casserole so this is something that we serve at the holidays at our house such as thanksgiving or christmas and i thought i would share it with you today so some of the ingredients are going to be sour cream a small muffin mix corn muffin a can of cream corn and a can of whole corn melted butter i have to melt it and three eggs and last a third of a cup of green onion so i'll bring you closer and you can see me mix it up and work right with me i'll see in a minute all right to start we're going to put three eggs in our mixing bowl so let's crack them and put them in one two three okay we're going to whisk those up this tool is called a whisk and water turns for eggs of your milk mixing mouth or something like that in it you might use a whisk to make everything blend very very well okay so those are whisk so i'm gonna set that on the side we're gonna add a third of a cup of green onion and it says with the tops so we might not use all of this but we'll use some of it and i have my third of a cup right here put them in i think it's going to take around two green onions and i do just little slices you can do it any way you want in case i don't need all the onion i'll go up here the green adds a nice little color to it a little bit more now if you don't like onion or you don't like a lot of onion you could always put less maybe you want to add some green pepper or something else to it i think that'll do it yep so we had about this much left not too much so we'll put that in and let's put this on the side so this is a third of a cup of green onion we'll give that a little stir and next we're going to add our cream corn it's just a regular can of cream corn i like to use a spatula to make sure i get everything out of the can just makes it a little bit easier but maybe you want to use a spoon and that would work too and then i'm going to add a can of just regular corn um you also instead of adding a regular can of corn sometimes i've also used frozen corn that i thawed and this is about two cups so i would just add two cups of regular cork but i'm using can today because that's what i have on hand give a little stir [Music] okay now i'm going to add my my package of i'm just using a kifi a jiffy corn muffin mix you can use whatever brand this is 8.5 ounces there might be a bit of a variation out there but i've always used just this brand but i'm sure any of them will work so i'm going to dump that in give it a little stir now while you're mixing this up you might want us to preheat your oven to 350 degrees because that's what we're going to bake it at we're going to bake this at 350 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes or it depends until the edges are brown okay now we have that then we're going to put in a cup of sour cream move this out of the way and i have a cup measuring cup this is one cup so i'm just gonna scoop it in now just you know i've also made this with yogurt half yogurt all yogurt and that's worked just fine too but today because i have sour cream in the house i'm using sour cream there we go one cup put it in now i like to use a spatula again so i can get everything out one of my favorite utensils in the kitchen are little bitty spatulas all right scoop this off all right and put the cover back on this and after i mix this in i melted my two tablespoons of butter remember when you get out a stick of butter you can look on the side and there are lines each stick of butter has eight tablespoons in it you need two tablespoons so i cut off two tablespoons put it in a little dish and put it in the microwave oh for 30 seconds so this is my two tablespoons of melted butter so i'm gonna dump that in again i'm gonna use my little spatula finish mixing it see mix this up very very well all righty so now we're going to put this in an 8x8 pan and before i do that i'm going to spray it i'm not going to today but you can also add an eighth of a teaspoon of crushed red pepper if you want to if you want it to be a little bit more spicy i'm not going to do that because my family doesn't like it quite so spicy but it's you can if you want to so i'm going to spray my pan with some oil spray and then i'm going to just dump it in just like this this makes a great side dish for the holidays and you could serve it with chicken you could ham whatever you like i'm gonna use my spatula again my scraper it's just a mix and big kind of dish all right okay it's all mixed up i'm gonna put it in the oven and i'll see you back here in 30 to 40 minutes welcome back our festive scalp corn casserole is baked doesn't it look nice what a good job you did all right let's cut it and see how it looks i think i'll use a spatula there look in the inside it's still hot but it is finished doesn't that look good i hope you'll make this for your holiday thanks for joining me today i hope you have a nice holiday i hope you make something you like and i'll see you next time bye", "G_ymb4Yg7-k": "[Music] now no woodworker likes to admit that they make mistakes when they're building cabinets but it happens especially when you do custom cabinets and you know when you're just making cuts that you have made before and it's not a repetition thing yet and it could be just a you know miscalculation and measurement in my case it just could be an epidemic a stupidity that happens and I got caught up in it but what happened on this case here is that these are going to be drawers in here so these shelves are basically just spacers so when I made the dados here on my dado blade I have shims that go in between things to make a little thicker now the plywood that I use to measure with was actually applied with thickness which is slightly less than one about 1/32 less than 3/4 but this particular plywood is actually 3/4 so when I went to put this all in there it's not going to fit so what I did was I went back in and I made the grooves a little wider basically using I was doing the quarter-inch groove in the back here so I used that and made them a little bit wider which works done everything except this particular one here and I don't know why but I took like over a sixteenth of an inch off on it which was just way too much and so it left quite a bit of gap so I spared you all the profanity that happened right after that but what I did was I decided that the main point is right up here in the Purpleheart up at the front here these caps I want them to fit nice and tight so that we don't have any gaps so I took a piece of Purpleheart 3/4 inch piece of Purpleheart a nice thin piece of 1/16 inch wide piece and I glued it in right here along this bottom that way the bottom is less likely we know and once it's glued in here what I did was I used the piece of plywood to hold it and I had a longer piece and you see in the video and while the player was in there after glue after the glue was dry I used my pole saw and made a nice flush cut on and I'll sand this down a little bit too but I left her crowd in the front so that way I could sand it when everything's all together and it will blend in really well so this was the most important part to make sure that it was a nice tight fit so by having a little bit bigger I used my file and filed it down until this fit in there you know nice nice snug fit there and that's that way it's not noticeable and this looks really good up front now and it will look even better once everything's all glued together and sand it but I do have a problem of this gap all the way back here now again this is not resting on anything so I could just you know wedge in here and that would work perfect but what I do is add some three-quarter inch maple and I cut a sixteenth inch strip on my bandsaw which fortunately I have a bandsaw that I can do that with and what I will do is I'll slide this right on in here when I glue everything up and glue it right to this piece of wood and that will give it enough support here so that nothing's gonna be moving and moving and this will all be nice and tight there so that's the way it's going to fit and this is going to be a drawer that's coming in here so you never gonna see this part right here another reason why I open you know if you use the open framework here is that we're not going to see that so like I said I don't generally show my mistakes on there I do seem to make them every well not everyone's wall but enough to get through frustrating but I thought it would be a good idea to show you how I fix them rather than cut a new piece now I do have a couple pieces that are right over there they're all set to go and I could have actually recut this whole thing but the purple heart and the maple is it kind of expensive you don't have to recut it it's better that you don't and just fix your mistakes so this is how I fix this particular mistake we're too wide of a dado groove in here so that everything fits tight so hopefully that helps you in your work and if you make a mistake you can think of ways to fix it similar to this so that you don't have to throw away the whole thing or you know start all over which is always better than it's always better to fix if you can rather than start over and it saves you a lot of money so hopefully you found this helpful if you did please subscribe and like the video and let me know in the comments below if you have any ideas or fixes of your own and don't be afraid to post pictures with it too", "zbrPQ89zNm8": "hey everyone its Daphne we're gonna get started on page one of graphic 45 life is a journey again this is the eight and a half by eight and a half mini album it's got four pocket pages and if you go to the playlist for life as a journey you'll see the walk through the second video is going to be the base album build which actually says eight and a half by eight and a half and that is the album that you'll be building everything that you see here is based on that album so here is my pocket page page one I noted that it's page one I also put an S over here by the spine so that I can keep track of which side the spine is on and which side the pocket is gonna be on because I want some of my flaps to operate away from the spine and others toward the spine so it's always a good idea to just make a little note there okay with that I'm gonna go ahead and sit down and get started I'm excited I've already got a couple things done today but trying to make some more progress okay let's go ahead and start by telling you what we're doing so we're going to have a small pocket it's going to be on the spine side we have a large flap that's going on the outside of the book or the pocket side and then there is one more flap oops and I forgot to put tape on it there's gonna be one more flap and it's actually gonna be installed on the same size as the pocket and the hinge will be actually underneath the pocket and when it's all finished this will close you have your pocket and then this flap is gonna hold everything together sorry about that I'm having a hard time with the weather and my allergies so with that let's go ahead and get started by laying down just the the straightforward one here and I realized I got in here without my pick tool and I'm gonna just use my fingernails cuz they're a tool also not my favorite tool though okay so this is gonna go again on the pocket side and let me tell you the measurements for this this is six and a half by eight six and a half by eight and you're gonna score a half-inch so when you're finished you've got a a 6x8 finished panel again this is the pocket side the spine side I'm just putting this on the edge there we go so there's our first installation and I'm just checking to make sure everything is square and nothing is hanging off the edges and we're pretty happy with that especially since I broke a rule and didn't drive it first okay so the next thing is going to be this little pocket and this pocket is 2 and 5/8 2 and 5/8 by 9 and you're gonna score half-inch on three sides and then you will be fin it you'll have a finished 2 in 1/8 inch pocket like so and I did that the 2 and 1/8 is just slightly larger than the space because I wanted this flap to go right over it and not get stuck inside the pocket so it's only an eighth of an inch longer than the space that I had here you of course could make it deeper if you wanted but I'm gonna show you why I did that when I lay down the designer papers ok so again one more time 2 and 5/8 by 9 2 and 5/8 by 9 and I don't know how long I'm gonna last without my pick tool it didn't take me any time at all to get fed up with trying to peel it off with my nails okay there we go now this is the spine side I'm just turning it toward me so I can see three of the four sides to try to get this in straight I'm going to press one corner down and hold the other edges up while I pivot it into place there we go okay there's my pocket I'll just demonstrate that real quick for you oh you know what I just did I blew it I guess I can do it this way I this flap needs to be it could have been installed underneath the pocket but I'm actually gonna install it on top of the pocket because there's gonna be a map that goes over anyway but you could do it the other way if you like that was actually my original plan but I don't think it matters much this flap that I'm doing right now was kind of a boy I'm really not prepared I don't have my tape tear tool either a last-minute decision to add okay so like I said you could have installed this first and then put the pocket over it but I'm gonna do it this way actually I think I kind of like it better this way and here's why this hinge would be under there and another hinge would be under there and when you go to put things in the pocket it might get stuck on it cuz it would be taller instead of going all around the hinge like so it might just run into it get stuck because it would be too let me tell you the measurements for this this is 5 and 1 8 5 in 1 8 by 6 and 3/8 5 and 1/8 by 6 and 3/8 and then you're gonna score a half-inch on the 5 and 1/8 inch side and then we're gonna apply this directly to the edge centered and I'm not marking it I'm eyeballing it there we go ok so that's in okay it's gonna close like so so it's pretty straightforward now I'm going to show you what the papers are gonna look like and then I got a take break because I got in here without my magnets so this is gonna go here this strife it's gonna go here I've got this front this side we're gonna pull the stripes back in here and this is actually gonna go on the cover of this flap and then I cut out these four pieces and I'm going to do like a mosaic right here of these four so that's what this spread is gonna look like when I'm done but like I said I got in here without my magnet so I need to go get those in order to plan the magnet placement before I put my mats down so I'll be back in just a minute okay I'm back and I want to give you a heads up these are not trimmed down to size so we are gonna do a little bit of trimming after I get the big pieces in and set the magnets so I'm just giving you a heads up so the way this is all going to close oops sorry about that it's like soap so I want the magnet on the inside here and then there's gonna be a put a magnet on the side so I'm getting my fat tape ready and it's not a requirement but I like to put it over the magnet for a couple reasons one when you put glue on top of the magnet it doesn't really want to dry so there's some issue once you put your mat down that it may not stick the way you want it to but it'll also soften the edge of the magnet so and I hate these I I have such a hard time getting the back off these because the tool I want to use is is magnetized so a lot of times you guys don't see me do this but I do it offline and get them all ready so that you don't have to watch me fight with these magnets okay so I want this to go about here I think and it's gonna come across to this side close like so all right so there is the magnet placement okay so now I don't have to worry about accidentally putting my paper down which as you know I've been known to do I'm gonna set all these loose pieces aside and we are gonna focus on getting in this cover which I'm dry fitting and then we are going to cover this flap and come back to the inside because it'll take the most time since I have to do some trimming as we go okay so I'm looking for this even border and I'm really happy with the way that trimmed out so I'm ready for my glue and I'm gonna brush that in place while I was gone I went and got all the rest of my tools this is the challenge oops cap came off it's time I'm almost out of glue and it's time for me to clean my cap and you guys have seen that process I've got a quick video on it but it's about time for me to do that that's why this kept following the cap and by the way for our new subscribers this glue tip is available in our shop and I love it I used to always lose my pens and that was frustrating to me and then I wind up putting another straight pin in it that would not be stainless so it would rest and discolor my glue so I've had this cap for going on about a year and the one I had before it lasted about a year and that was before I started taking care of them so my expectation is this is going to continue to last and for the price it's it's a worthwhile it really reduces my frustration and trying to track down my pins [Applause] [Laughter] and it doesn't it really doesn't and basically what I do is when I when I run out of a bottle this is a four ounce bottle then before I apply put the cap on a new bottle I clean my cap and I just that's my ongoing process now that if I'm changing the glue out actually I'm gonna go this way it's time to go ahead and clean the cap alright that is looking very good I'm very happy with that she's so pretty Oh for a limited time or at least until if we run out of these charms we have a charm with this style a dog and it's so cute I don't have it in the room with me but I'm definitely going to be using that charm in this album okay so now let's go ahead and get this piece in so this is just gonna be a purple and I told you guys in the first video that I was trying to avoid the purple just cuz it's not my favorite but I'm gonna go ahead and lay this on so it really tones that down quite a bit okay so I didn't do it on camera but I did go ahead and ink all my edges and again I'm using what's called mahogany and I'm really liking it and hopefully we'll get through page one before I have to get in a glue bottle art glitter glue came out with a new 4 ounce format so it's a long thin bottle more like the 2 ounce bottle it's much easier to hold some it's been pretty popular but this fad style is going away which I won't miss it when it's gone I like the 4 ounce because I need a lot of glue I didn't like the format because it's not as easy to hold so I'm anxious to start to move over to the new format okay so that's in and then this is just a mat that we're gonna put this untrimmed ephemera journaling card on so it's gonna go just like so and this is just gonna get it here directly to this panel so I just wanted a nice purple border around it I'd like to welcome to all our new subscribers yay we're getting more subscribers we really appreciate you guys tuning in this is our scrap and create channel where you can find all the tutorials for our projects in the playlist they're there for you to use and enjoy and share they are free they will continue to be free they'll always be out there I have no plan and then do not anticipate removing any of those videos so if you start a project that video will be there for you to reference until you're done with your project so please share that with friends that you know are into mini album making and like I said if you go to the playlist you'll see all of our projects and they're grouped by the title of the paper and if you select view all videos you will see all the tutorials for a given project co-located so that helps it that makes it easy for you to find the next video in the sequence of the tutorial okay and I hoped I like to think that the longer I do this the better my videos are so you have to apologize some of the older projects aren't quite as organized I kind of learned some stuff along the way alright so now we're ready to do the inside let's go ahead and lay down the pocket liner and I'm gonna look at this for a second decide which way I want the stripes and I think I liked it the first way with this bold red line and you're probably not gonna be trimmed at exactly the same size but you'll just want to look at it both ways and see what looks best this striped pattern that I'm pulling in is from the 8x8 collection pack I don't think I mentioned that earlier this is 12 by 12 this is from the 8 by 8 of course the this is ephemera and then the purple is from the 12 by 12 patterns of solids and I'll try to keep remembering to share that with you guys so you know which pack you're pulling the paper from and only if you want to make it exactly like what I've done if you want to do some variation then of course it doesn't really matter okay so pattern Salas let's go right here and then we're gonna add this paper and then we're gonna do the blocking in here come on there we go [Laughter] turn it so I can see what I'm doing and this has orientation so I just want to make sure I've got it right side up and I do alright that's it okay the next large panel it's going to go here as you can see I'm kind of alternating the pattern so here up I told you I was going to tell you why I did this so originally I planned this piece to go on the inside just as a solid piece like so and then I decided that was too much stripe it was just kind of overwhelming so it was already trimmed down to be 8x8 so then I decided well if I put a two inch pocket in here and split this off it would still be big enough to go over here and then I could put an alternating pattern here so that's kind of how I came up with that and that's why that is 2 inches wide because it came from that 8 inch panel that I had originally planned so rather than have it go to waste I split it 2 by 6 and now this piece will cover the inside of this flap perfectly and I had enough for the pocket so that was my design process for anybody who trying to figure out what my planning process was now because these are because this fits exactly and doesn't overlap I can't put a magnet here to hold this flap down which is why I introduced the next flap here typically when I have a flap I want it to come further over to the the pocket so that I can apply a magnet to this flap into the top of the pack pocket you don't want your magnet here because you're gonna stuff a bunch of stuff inside this pocket and it's gonna be so thick that the magnet won't adhere so you want it to reach across the pocket or introduce another flap so that's another design tip and I'll try to share those as I go sometimes I forget it depends on when I designed the book and when I'm actually videotaping because sometimes weeks can go by and I can't remember why I did something hey sorry about that my sister just called me we're getting ready to go out and do something but I'm gonna finish this page before I take off and here is the current plan so it's going to lay out just like so so here's what I'm planning to do these will each need to be trimmed out to fit perfectly and I'm gonna lay these two down first and then I want a little excess on this side because I really want it to slip slightly inside the pocket just like so so I'm gonna wind up with a nice black line between each of these pieces but that means I have to do a little bit of trimming let's see and first we're going to start by trimming the middle piece so I figure out I need to figure out how much needs to come off each of these so we have a nice perfect gap here now if this is too tedious for you I can appreciate that there's two things that you can do one you can put a solid panel here and of course you've got lots of colors to choose from because we used to stripe you can put a solid panel here or you can and I've shown you how to do this on the cover put tape behind all of these make a single panel and trim it down to fit so that it's acting like a single piece of paper now the last thing you can do and I just recently seen a scrapper do this I'm like I don't remember who did it she had glued all these pieces together but she wanted it to look like it was pieced so she took a very thin eighth inch piece of black paper and ran it up and down and side-to-side and it gives you that the effect of the color blocking like I like to do and it's a lot less tedious so it's entirely up to you not everybody's trimmer will trim a thin piece like that so it was just something I had recently seen and I thought hey that's pretty good idea you could probably save a little bit of frustration in time if you did that so okay so it looks like I think these are measured out at seven eighths so it looks like I need to take a sixteenth inch off both of these so I'm gonna do that and I'm stacking them to trim them together and then I'm gonna lay them down and see what it looks like so let's see if that was enough nope it needed to be an 8 so I had started with 4 inch so it really needs to be an 8 inch off so 3 and 7/8 is the height 3 and 7/8 is the height I'm double-checking and of course the more pieces you have the harder it is to get that uniformity but when you're done it really looks pretty ok I'm happy with that so I'm gonna trim these down to 3 and 7/8 3 and 7/8 this way and then I'm gonna leave this with the loan I may adjust the width here not sure so my recommendation is to stack and trim together and that way you know you've got a continuous line and that looks that looks like it's gonna work for me so what I'm gonna do first is lay down the outside and then I'm going to take these two and slide them slightly into the pocket when I lay them down so I'm going to turn this around and look for my placement and that looks good yay ok because I trimmed I need to Inc one of these edges so it's 3 and 7/8 edge high and just so you know these are three inches across that is not gonna be in the cut list so if you guys want details on how I'm trimming out the designer paper you really need to watch the video and watch my process because honestly I think if I tried to give you a cut list for this you'd be unhappy you really need to check it against your album for any variations with the pocket or the panel size alright I'm not gonna burnish this into place I'm gonna leave it lightly there and try to get this in support rise so I can tweak them if I need to and I just realized I put that in upside down because it is directional or did I know I didn't I had it right I'm looking at the panel across from it yeah that's the right direction okay this is directional too so I'm just trying to make sure I don't put these in upside down there we go there it is so I just kind of tacked down this this side and then I wanted to make sure this was staying nice and even before I pressed everything into place again I can appreciate it if you guys don't want to work do the piecing it is tedious you can do one contrasting panel here or marry these up with tape and then treat it as a single piece and trim it down to size okay so those two were the hardest months to put in everything else is gonna get measured off what's it's already down so there's some consolation so I'm just making sure I've got everything going the right direction there we go and it's slightly into the pocket which is nice and here's our last piece that's just about it for the jewelry which is good timing because this is my last piece hey making sure my flowers are going the right direction they are slipping it slightly into the pocket looking for this continuous line here and here and as you can see we collectively did a good job I'm very happy with the way that looks little bit of effort but it's very beautiful now each one of these you could easily put a 3x3 or you know you could put a small photo on each one of these blocks or you could jump you know let me trim out a piece of paper give you guys an example let's go ahead and do a 4 by 6 or you could do a 4 by 6 and you see the pattern behind it it's very pretty 5 by 7 would fit here as well or leave it just for its beauty and put all your photos into the pocket like so I'm very happy with why this came out

notification every time i make a new video today i'm here to tell you about a video game that a friend of mine jeremy is working on with his brother dwight and it's called beckoned it's an old school style jrpg game and he does a weekly stream on youtube and 8pm on fridays so if that's something you're interested in definitely check him out i'm gonna leave his information like his website and his youtube down below that way you can check it out so during the weekly stream jeremy mentioned that food plays a big part into bonus in healing with main characters on their journey and ask for some feedback in making pocket type foods to bring along on their journey to help heal them when they're low on hp so i got really excited i love making food i love video games and i really jump at the opportunity to make something like this so as he was doing his streams he started making a character from the ground up and her name is nalka she is the mother of the main protagonist inel and she's known as one of the village elders and also is a skilled urbologist and very skilled in the kitchen as well so i had this idea of just uh nauka making a very simple but delicious sweet loaf for her daughter and her friends that they can enjoy around the table together after a long day just having fun enjoying each other's company so today that's what i'm going to show you how to make so this recipe is a simple pumpkin loaf and it has walnuts in it for an extra texture and then it also has a nice crunchy crispy sugary strudel on top and this recipe is best the day you make it but it can be enjoyed throughout the week my husband and i enjoy it in the morning with a nice cup of coffee or tea or preference and so without further ado we're going to get started in making noka's sweet gourd loaf i hope you enjoy it 5 tablespoons of packed light brown sugar 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon one tablespoon of softened unsalted butter one tablespoon of all-purpose flour and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt you'll need two cups of all-purpose flour and then you'll need one and a half teaspoons of baking powder and then half a teaspoon of baking soda a 15 ounce can of unsweetened pumpkin puree uh one and a half teaspoons of cinnamon one teaspoon of salt and a fourth of a teaspoon of ground nutmeg and an eighth of a teaspoon of brown cloves after that you'll need 1 cup of granulated sugar and then 1 cup packed light brown sugar half a cup of vegetable oil four large eggs at room temperature and then fourth of a cup of buttermilk four ounces of cream cheese cut into 12 small pieces at room temperature and last but not least a cup of toasted walnuts chopped up and another quick reminder to have all your refrigerated ingredients at room temperature before starting 5 tablespoons of sugar butter and your cinnamon flour and that salt and then you're going to start using your hands to stir it together like a fine sand this is your strudel topping for your bread this is what it looks like and what consistency you're going for i'm using some vegetable shortening to grease to eight and a half by four and a half inch loaf pans the vegetable shortening definitely ensures that these will slide out of the pan with no problems after this you're gonna whisk together your flour baking powder and baking soda together in a bowl and set it to the side i usually like to put my dry ingredients first that way they're ready and all mixed together for when you have to add them to your wet ingredients later so for the wet ingredients we're going to take that can of pumpkin and put it in a large saucepan over a medium heat and then you're also gonna take the cinnamon salt ground nutmeg and ground cloves and you're gonna mix them together for about five to eight minutes and make sure you're constantly stirring it because it will scald at the bottom and what you're looking for is to reduce it to about or one and a half cups it's gonna start turning a darker richer color that's when you know you're doing it right and if you want to measure it after that's absolutely fine this is the coloring consistency and about the amount you're looking for after you reach that point you're going to take it off the heat for the next steps just be careful with handling the pot it's still really hot this is what your mixture is going to look like you're going to take your granulated sugar and your brown sugar and then you're going to take your vegetable oil and the cream cheese and stir it till it's just combined then you want to let that mixture sit for five minutes and then you want to whisk it all together so it's completely combined while i'm doing this step i'm just gonna let you guys know that even though it is a long ingredients list this really is a simple recipe and it's also perfect for this time of year and i actually can't wait for jeremy to try it we did send out a loaf for him had a few issues with sending it to him so we tried again he should be getting it today actually my husband and i had a lot of fun trying to pack this up so it looked like something straight out of devonis so we're really excited for him to get it so after you've let it sit for five minutes and you start whisking it together this is going to be the consistency that you're going for so now you're going to take your four eggs and your buttermilk and then you are going to whisk them together until they are completely combined and you know this is a really cool recipe because you don't need a kitchenaid you don't need a hand mixer just do it all by hand which i'm pretty sure that's how they do it in nevada's so you're going to take your pumpkin puree and add it to that egg and buttermilk mixture and once you pour it in make sure you get out any extra bits and then you are going to whisk it together till it is completely combined i love video games and i love reading so a lot of the stuff that i make are inspired by stuff i read or see and those things and it's always really fun to see how they come out so once that's completely combined we are going to take our dry ingredients and then pour them in gently so it doesn't poof out everywhere and you want to just start folding that together so there are barely any lumps a few you know flower lumps are okay but you don't want to over stir this at all [Music] and once that is almost fully combined you are going to add your toasted walnuts and then fold those gently in so you do not crush them into tinier bits finally we are in our home stretch where we are going to be evenly putting this mixture into these two greased loaf pans just take care so you don't spill any and you know it doesn't have to be perfect but try to make them as even as you possibly can using a rubber spatula to get the rest of it out and then finally you are going to put that strudel sugar mixture we made in the beginning and distribute it evenly on top of each loaf then you will be baking these in a oven preheated to 350 degrees for about 45 to 50 minutes rotating about halfway through so you have an even bake and then you can check once they are done if they come clean through a toothpick and you will set them out on a wire rack for about 20 minutes before you pop them out of the pans and once you pop these out of the pans patience is a virtue and you want to at least wait an hour hour 20 minutes before you cut into these that way they have a chance to set these totally make your house smell just like a beautiful fall day and too bad when we live it's not quite there yet after they've cooled down a bit you can use a serrated knife cut at a diagonal angle so it doesn't crush the loaf and check out that inside it's perfect if you guys try this recipe let me know how it turns out or if you have any questions please ask and i will do my best to answer them and don't forget to check out the website for backend and join jeremy and dwight on their live stream friday at eight o'clock eastern time and have a good day you guys", "zMnbSaicb8w": "hey guys we're going to get right into this recipe we're going to start out I have a food scale here and I'm going to measure out 8 ounces of rigatoni pasta and one half pound of lean ground beef I actually use a little bit more because I'm a beefy girl one half cup of chopped onion one clove of minced garlic actually bought this jar of garlic and I'm spooned out what I felt one about a club a little bit more for me because I like garlic 1 15 and a half ounce jar of meatless spaghetti sauce which is roughly 16 ounces roughly a pound 18 teaspoon of pepper 1 15 ounce container ricotta cheese one half cup of milk one-half teaspoon salt 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese divided so I just split my cheese in half 4 ounces here and then 4 ounces in a separate container this is Parmesan cheese two tablespoons grated I just measured out two tablespoons there so let's start cooking okay step 1 preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit spray an 8 by 8 inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray step two cook pasta according to package directions drain and set aside for the pasta that i'm using the actual instructions were to boil it for roughly 12 minutes so i just set my timer on the microwave here to 12 minutes meanwhile cook the onion and garlic and a large skillet over medium-high heat for four minutes or until the meat is lightly browned stir in spaghetti sauce and pepper reduce heat simmer for 10 minutes or until meat is cooked through step 4 in a large bowl combine ricotta cheese milk and salt add rigatoni to cheese mixture and toss to coat step 5 spoon hat the rigatoni mixture into baking dish sprinkle one-half cup mozzarella on top then add one cup weak sauce mixture repeat layers with remaining pasta cheese and sauce sprinkle with parmesan cheese step 6 bake 20 minutes or until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit and here is the finished product you guys this was really really delicious it's already a home favorite and I can't like to make it again actually and you can see here it was very cheesy and me and my husband we adore she so if you love cheese especially in you know hardy beat the pasta type dish this is a great dish is kind of like a play on lasagna except it's using rigatoni so I hope you guys give this a try and I hope you guys like it hi [Music]", "zsOWHR1PkSM": "everyone walking back to the range got some Aguila to test today this is their mini shells this is the slug we have 2 barrel lengths to run these through today let's check them out Aguila was actually nice enough to send some of these over a few months ago for us to sample and it got cold outside so I was gonna wait to a break in the weather and we've got that we have two barrel lengths a 12 and 19 inch what you see in front of you is my 870 SBS and then we have one of the SAS 12 semi automatics I've tested these before off-camera and they won't cycle the SAS action but we'll just run them one at a time pro kleh no digital is always 10 to 12 feet it's approximately 55 degrees outside today let's do this we'll grab the 870 SBS first usually with these shorter ones you're gonna run the action pretty fast then I'll feed 708 791 840 to 810 [Applause] [Applause] 8:15 763 786 900 they count wrong 890 now we have a sass 12 semi-automatic shotgun this did have a 26 inch barrel and I think I might make it a short Brill shotgun project not sure so I cut the rail down to 19 inches I might try to thread the barrel for chokes or something 9:43 9 1996 t 823 69 24 998 well there you guys have it basically these are subsonic out of both barrel lengths they do claim 1250 on the box I don't know if that's out of like a 24 inch or a 26 inch or 28 inch 12 gauge barrel we didn't see that with our typical short barrels here again I like to thank a Gila for providing us with ammunition and tests we've tested their 5 5 6 9 or 308 and there's nine-millimeter stuff runs pretty good again thank you all for watching until next time catch you at the range", "dqWI2meJ2jM": "hey guys Matt Allen here welcome back to tactical bass and today we are talking springtime fishing with Texas rigs it doesn't get simpler than a Texas rig and it will catch a ton of fish but today we're going to cover some of my favorite baits some of my favorite colors and a couple of tricks you can use to get more bites in the spring let's start off with why a Texas rig as well as what is a Texas rig essentially a Texas rig it can be done weightless or with a weight in this case it's got a weight on it we put a weight on the line then we tie on a wide gap hook here's an example of a wide gap hook you tie on a wide gap hook and then we thread a bait on to it let me undo this one I'll show you so we take that bait we go through the nose pop it out the side slide it all the way up turn that bait around push the hook through and then I really like to do what's called Tex posing where you rehook the tip of that point back into that plastic that's a basic Texas rig debate right there now you can also do it weightless I think oh let me see if I have one laying around here any cinco's I've got a beat-up saenko same thing with a cinco this is the weightless version so you just be tied directly to your line slide that up turn it around poke through and then skin hook it the important thing with a Texas rig is that it fits perfectly straight when you're done if that thing ends up kinked in any which way it's not going to work anywhere near as well so that is a Texas rig now let's talk about why a Texas rig essentially you can fish it anywhere it's incredibly adaptable and it's weedless as long as you've got that point tucked in this thing will come through any sort of cover with ease so whether you're a guy fishing on a pond standing on the bank casting out there and you don't want to lose baits or you're on a boat and the fish are and the thickest of cover and you're firing deep into that cover with a heavy weight or you're anywhere in between a Texas rig will come in and out of cover without getting snagged so it's a great option now with that said after that the varieties are endless you can do it with worms you could do it weightless like a sank oh you could do it weighted like a speed worm but one of my favorite ways to fish a Texas rig them what we'll focus on today is creature baits now in a very near future oh I don't know maybe a week or two we'll head underwater and we'll look at these baits and I think you'll really take a lot away from that footage we'll watch how fish actually interact with these baits but today we're going to just focus in on the baits themselves and how to fish them so essentially a Texas rig what I like to do with it just throw it out now if it's a heavy cover throw it out go through the cover and just shake it in place let it sit shake it in place let it sit pull it out but if I'm fishing open or cover throw up against the cover and then just work it let it sit reel up the slack work it let it sit reel up the slack anywhere that you throw a jig you can also throw a Texas rig a Texas rig again will get a lot of bites because you have variety so it'll catch a lot of fish it's extremely adaptable and again it's weedless I break my baits down into two categories baits that have a lot of action baits that have very little action and I treat them very very differently let's start with baits that don't have as much action this is what I like to do so we'll take the beaver as an example and basically I have two baits in this category that I really like first one is the beaver second one is the big bite and I'll link these exact baits down in the video description for you so you know exactly what we're talking about and colors and everything because color is key this time of year in spring color will help you get a lot of bites so with either one of these baits can you open this one up let me get a beaver out of this one with either one of these baits there are very little action on their way to the bottom the beaver now with a beaver it comes tails connected we rip those open okay but it has very little action on its way down it just essentially falls like a rock to the bottom this guy it's got a little bit of action it's got a little bit of kick in those tails on its way down but it doesn't have a ton of action most of its action comes on the bottom so with baits that don't do a whole lot on the way down I'll typically use a heavier weight something like a half ounce at the most I don't usually go more than half ounce in the pre spawn or in the spring once we get a little farther into the year you get more vegetation or spending more time punching and flipping and cover I'll go up to those bigger weights but typically I max out at half ounce in the spring so put a half ounce weight on but before I do I put a punch stop on the line so essentially you take one of these put your line through pull it up on the line and it prevents the weight from sliding up the line so you put your weight on then you tie everything on so the only thing different between this technique and what I would do is I put a punch stop on and it prevents that weight from moving at all and I put it very close to the weight within an eighth of an inch so if there is a plate if there's any play at all it's just a tiny little bit what that does is it causes that bait to fall to the bottom as quickly as possible and again I tend to focus on the heavier weights three-eighths half ounce there's not a lot going for me getting that bait to bottom so I want to get it there quickly and I want to stay connected to that bait once it's down I can treat those baits pretty aggressively I can hop them I can pop them with a dead action bait and that's not a very glamorous term but that's essentially what it is these baits get bit because of profile because of how they look not because of how they move so a lot of my bites will come as a reaction to that sharp fast movement so a bait like this I'll fish it pretty aggressively hop hop let it fall hop let it fall not a lot of that ultra slow stuff now there are there are times where that will work really well but if I'm choosing a place to start I'm gonna be pretty aggressive with these baits with that heavier weight on they hop and fall very quickly and a lot of the reactions from the bass will come as that bait hops near them and they just they just suck it in they lash out at it so again dead action baits peg that sinker a little bit heavier weight and you can get those stronger reaction bites by being aggressive now baits that have more movement let's pull some of these out of here consume baby brush hog is one that is like the original it's an awesome bait you can't talk this category without talking about that baby but here's a couple of my real favorites most of these if not all these you've heard us talk about reaction innovations manbearpig absolutely deadly bait that we have caught it on of fish on it deadly deadly bait with a lot of movement in the water missile base destroyer another one with an incredible amount of movement as that bait goes to the bottom and then last the Chi tech crazy flopper here's one out of the package high tech crazy flapper and it the crazy flapper tells you what you need to know it flaps like crazy these giant moving arms so with baits that have a lot of action any of these baits these are my essentials really the crazy flapper that destroyer and that manbearpig are the baits that I turn to most often what I do differently is I do not pay get so back to this setup here let's get rid of this bait let's put on a destroyer pop out the side turn it around look through and skin hook okay sliding weight is critical for these baits unless I absolutely have to 3/8 ounce is my maximum and given a preference I'm gonna drop down to 3/16 or 1/8 ounce just that little tiny tungsten weight without a peg the reason why is that these baits have so much action and they look so good on the fall that their action alone will get bit so with these baits you throw it out there as it's going to the bottom that weight will take off ahead of that bait it'll still pull the bait down but not as quickly the weight will get to the bottom first and then that bait will swim down behind it when you make your motions the bait is not as a aggressive it's slower movement because it's not fixed to the weight so the weight will still jump up and then pull that bait but it's a slower motion the bait spends more time fluttering on its own the more action the bait has the more I like that lighter weight unpicked it makes all the difference I think you will find that it will make a huge difference for you this spring the other thing with these Texas rigs and again today we're keeping this really really simple will go underwater soon but today I just want you to understand the baits and the basics of the technique and those little nuances that I think make a huge difference the other difference is color these baits that I've picked out I've picked out for very specific reasons the destroyer great colors as well as incredible action my favorite color there's probably sprayed grass it's got a really good look to it in the springtime the crazy flapper and again I'm gonna link all of this the crazy flapper I throw in this crazy color green pumpkin fire that same one I had in my hand it's a bright orange and green pumpkin it actually falls right in line with what we've been telling you with all these different techniques and we're going to build on it which is in the spring I really like to to focus in on those bluegill type colors if I have clearer water if you have muddy water that stuff goes out the window focus on your black blues your green pumpkin black blue those combination colors haematoma those colors that are bold junebug that will stand out and get you bites in that water but if you got clarity focus on those bluegill type colors we've talked it's fun about magic cross swirl from the in the beaver we've talked about that one you can also get that exact same color in the manbearpig and this is another one flora Bama you can get it in both we haven't talked about this one but it's a blue mixed with an orange again we're going for those blue gill type colors and do either one of these baits look like a bluegill on their own absolutely not but the bass respond to those profiles they respond to the movement and they respond to those general colors and things that are just generally bluegill do extremely well so in reaction innovations that magic cross swirl flora Bama those are two of my absolute favorites either one and in both baits you can get both colors in both baits let me think what else again Kai Tek that green pumpkin fire color it's just got a lot of that green pumpkin and that bright bright bluegill orange it doesn't have the blue but again it does extremely well so as you're going through your box trying to figure out what to throw if you just want to be generic green pumpkin green pumpkin black flake will get you through anything if you've got muddy conditions black blue or some version thereof will get you through anything but if you want to try and fine-tune it especially in that really clear water turn to those bluegill tones and I'll give you the names of all those colors in the video description other than that keep it really really simple the only other tip I've got for you is with the hooks the two different kinds of hooks that I use for this Gamakatsu and owner Gamakatsu the ewg the wide gap hook both of them are wide gap hooks this is the jungle white gap this is the ewg the baits that you want to fall slower I tend to throw them on the Gamakatsu without this label without the super line just the standard ewg and in black or red sometimes I do really well on red particularly with cinco's I feel silly when I do it it looks silly in my hand but I get a lot of bites doing it but black or red mostly black but again no super line just the standard ewg it's a thinner wire it doesn't weigh as much and it lets that bait really slow flutter to the bottom but that ewg that wide gap that's my preference I really prefer wide gap hooks for all of my Texas raking over a standard round band or worm style hook then an owner let me back up all these creature baits I'm either going to throw on a three OTT or a four OTT in the Gamakatsu you do not need a five on three or four OTT is dynamite for all the baits we're talking about owner the jungle wide gap it's a very very strong hook it's a grey shadow type color so like a flat matte gray color this has a deeper throat I have fallen in love with this hook we were we were flipping with the five OTT and a six on last summer fell in love with it because it was so powerful now again it's a thick wire so not my choice for that ultra slow fall but if I'm around bigger fish or those dead action baits I know I'm gonna put the screws to a great big bass I want to get it into the boat my confidence is absolutely in the jungle hook now what the jungle because the deeper throat you do not need the four OTT for any of these baits you can throw all of them on the three odd so Gamakatsu for ott owner three OTT and you'll have a very similar sized hook hopefully that wasn't too confusing guys Texas rig fishing is really really fun because again you can adapt it to anything you could drop down to an eight ounce weight throw it ultra shallow up against the bank and just slow fish baits out of there just slow fishing you can shoot it into cover let that bait swim down it looks so good or you can go to a heavier weight and treat it almost like a jig where you throw it out and just popping and working that bait and those fish will just come out and smash [ __ ] so many different ways to adapt the technique and then of course we'd list or weightless where you just throw it and let it fall that senko you throw it and you just let it fall to the bottom it'll just flutter down then pop it up and let it fall again pop it up and let it fall again all the bites come on that drop well almost all the bites Texas rigging is really fun it's worth trying and I think when we go underwater you'll be blown away at how good they look and how the fish respond guys I hope this video helps you get out there this spring this is the time to go bass fishing go out there catch those fish they're getting aggressive they're starting to think about the spawn and they're moving up shallower every day you can catch them if you enjoyed the video hit the like button subscribe to the channel and we'll talk to you soon [Music] you you", "ZVvMviOSXLY": "this is a little very little as you can see as compared to my hand digital scale and this scale can weigh everything up to about 6.6 pounds and that is equivalent to 3 kilograms so this is a smaller smaller size scale and it's meant for weight for wings small amounts of things it comes with these two pieces which you can turn over and use as receptacles for putting things into way and then when you're all done with the scale that one fits on there and then you can just slide the scale in here and it's kind of like a protective case which is an ingenious idea this scale comes with two double-a batteries so everything is ready to go out of the box you just put in the batteries and you're ready to go it has an on/off button it has a changing your measurement scale pieces button and then it also has a tare button so for the modes you can there are four different modes that you can weigh things in so right now I don't know if you can see it but there's a tiny little G and that means grams then it can go two ounces and as you see it comes out to three decimal places which is really nice and then it's got CT and that is a carat weight and that's used for gemstones I don't have much experience with that other than I know what that stands for and then you have GN which is grain weight and I have zero experience with that and as a matter of fact I had to look that up online to see what GN stood for so grain weight is very small and I don't know what you would use it for I bet most people who get this are going to be using the grams or the ounces I know that's what I'll be using so I want to go over this tear button with you in case you're not familiar with how that works but the tare button does is it allows you to measure things when they're in a vessel without measuring the weight of the vessel so I'm going to go ahead and put that on there and this way is one point four eight five ounces so then I'm going to hit the tare button and it will zero out and so now it will weigh what I'm going to put in the vessel without weighing the vessel so my pen weighs 0.4 ounces so then when you're all done you take the whole thing off and now it's registering a negative number you just hit the tare button again and then you're back to zero so operation is very simple on this there's not a lot of ways to mess it up and before you just so you have a true idea of how big this scale is it is exactly 5 inches by 4 inches and the plate itself I believe is this is going to come out at 4 yeah 4 by 4 inches is the the plate itself and its profile off the table is about 3/4 of an inch", "Pv54Vkz0p64": "[Music] at channel islands everything that we do is performance oriented we're not satisfied with just making boards that go straight and fast we're interested in speed we're interested in flow and glide and getting that feeling that we're all after but you've got to be able to do the turns that you want to do you've got to be able to do your best surfing so this is the philosophy that we took into our new mid length straight rail board that has all that speed and glide you can draw those high lines and get that flying feeling but you can also really turn down the face and up the face and surf the board well [Music] one of the cool things that we have at channel islands having been around for 50 years is this incredible design library of templates and history and rockers and all the things that go into making a board and in the 70s my dad had a board called the huevo caliente which was this really beautiful looking mid-length egg sort of board and we've been looking at pictures of that around the factory lately we felt pretty inspired by that so we dipped back into the archives pulled out some of those old templates to accomplish those curves and yet updated the bottom so that the board performs like a modern board but has some of that classic feel and vibe that my dad created so long ago and in trying to put those things together and come up with a board that is sort of reaches back into the past but pushes us into the forward we into the future we want to engage with someone who knew those boards so our guy devin howard has been surfing these boards really well for a couple decades and so he was instrumental in the design process of us achieving our goals with this board for me personally i wanted to work on a board that blended all of the different characteristics of mid lengths that i really love into one and if you could do that what would the board look like and what would it be ultimately the ci mid is the best of everything that i love about mid-length surfboards you know having the low rocker the ease of paddle the glide but then being able to have a board that when you want to step on the tail and really turn and really get critical it's really expanded what i thought you could do on a mid-length and without getting too hyperbolic or really overblowing this i feel that the board that we've come up with is almost in a genre of its own when you put one of these under your arm i hope you see the love and the passion that went into this board and really i hope you have as much fun riding it as we have designing and building it for you [Music] so [Music] you", "-w3QqE2HkcE": "hi guys today we're gonna make the truth or we can call it cream puff our ingredients today will be five ounce of milk half cup of water three eggs 1/2 cup of butter 1/2 cup plus tablespoon sifted flour all-purpose flour mixed with 1 teaspoon sugar and 1 teaspoon salt so we're gonna need the saucepan we can add mix the water now and the butter we're gonna boil them and medium huh and we're gonna wait until got boiled after it got boiled we're gonna add the sifted flour with salt and sugar one time and then we gonna try to mix it with a wooden spoon and so we got a ball form okay guys no we have the boil milk water and butter so we're gonna add the sifted flour one time and keep mix them and so we have that for a ball form just keep and we can cook it like two more minutes almost there and I have the cake mixer ready I'm gonna use the puddle and then I'm gonna add the firm ball and the mixer and try to mix it for two minutes just to take off the heat now you can see the firm wall so I'm gonna love it here and then try to turn on the mixer using the puddle trying to take [Music] and mix it a little bit and so separate it again so you're gonna see does it looks like it's mix all together but when we gonna turn it on black for five minutes maybe less will begin cooperated now the batter is ready so I'm gonna scrape down all the batter and then we cannot talk about the pastry piping back so I have the pastry piping bag and I have the tip number 8 or 5 so I'm gonna cut like a small piece from the top and then insert the 805 tip like this I'm gonna squirt a little bit now we're gonna talk about because we need that fat factor to are the cream puffs to be all of them same size we don't wanna have small one and big one so what I have here I have I made a stencil and I have this round shape so I did here I hope you can see it so I have the sharpie and I did like a 3 x 5 circle like this and we don't want them all close to each other like this can you see the circles but the sharpie I'm gonna fur on the bottom because I don't want the Sharpie be on the job so so I'm gonna put a little bit here because I wanna stick it on the tray it's like a ghoul I'm gonna use it as I can because I don't want your paper so there is a certain way to use this one but please don't panic and what you're gonna do it's all about practice so what I'm gonna do just keep pushing the bottom and then swirled like this so now I have everything that's ready I have 15 piece of the cream puff and the oven is heated 350 and I'm gonna and serve the tray in the oven for 25 to 30 minutes John opened the oven during that 25 minutes so now so the cream puffs it has to kind of cream inside the following we're gonna make now the pastry cream the pastry cream ingredients is 2 cups of milk 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract correct cup of butter 2 whole eggs and two egg yolks and the dry ingredients is 4 tablespoon of corn starch mix with quarter cup of sugar and 1 1 quarter of teaspoon salt so in the beginning I'm gonna mix the eggs both of them so before I continue with this one I'm gonna pour the milk and vanilla and put them on medium please while I'm mixing the eggs medium heat okay mix the two whole eggs with two yolks and then add the dry ingredients keep mix after we have the milk and vanilla boiled I'm gonna temper that milk with the egg mixture [Music] now then well got boil I'm gonna temple and not a little bit with keep whisking because I want the hot milk affect the eggs keep a little bit milk and keep whisking okay so now I'm gonna return the whole mixture to the saucepan and put it back on the medium heat and keep whisking until I got a little bit stay back for 30 seconds and I will add the butter to it so now the mixture cut say so I'm gonna add butter to it and keep mix until the barakah after the burdock melt I'm gonna strain it Travis cream pastry cream to have a very smooth cream after I straining I'm gonna attack there directly the plastic wrap on top of it I'm gonna put directly on top of it touch it because we don't want to have any like a thick top on top of the screen like this so we're done from the basic cream I'm gonna prepare the other cream and then at the end I'm gonna mix them together and saw the cream puff okay so now we're gonna make a chocolate ganache to dip the cream puff on it so this is one cup of chocolate chip and one cup of heavy cream and I heat it with a medium heat and I'm pouring over the chocolate chip and leave it for two or three minutes and then we will whisk it so going back to the to the pastry cream we made but that was made from the egg and a ghost and then I told you the following Gates makes of two kind of cream this is the easy cream just like that 1 cup heavy cream mixed with one teaspoon of vanilla extract and choral cup of powdered sugar just keep whisk until you have this cream so what I'm gonna do now I'm gonna whisk this cream just to soft it and after I mix them I'm gonna use the pastry bag with a small tip to fill the cream puff so I'm going back to that chocolate chip and heavy cream so just keep mixing from the middle okay after I mix the two kind of cream to follow the cream puff I made the chocolate ganache from the chocolate chip and heavy whipping cream and puff pastry is ready out of the oven so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna fill them out with the Queen so I put the cream on the pastry bag using this very tiny tip or you can use whatever you have at home so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna pull it so I have the chocolate ganache ready so I'm gonna it's just a little bit like this", "D4MhXeSEqXM": "alright guys his North Carolina shooter so see I got my mouth Bird 935 this is my duck hunting shotgun push the video to the morning of us out in the boat couldn't a little breakfast getting ready to do some duck hunting and there's something I wanted to talk about here real quick see I got a couple couple boxes sitting out here got Winchester Super X this is 3-inch one on one 8-ounce load of number two shot and then I also have some very cheap nine dollars and forty nine cents at my local Dick's Dick's Sporting Goods Field & Stream 12-gauge steel shot and if you look one and 1/8 ounce load of number two shot three-inch also so this is steel shot this is still shot that's what you have to use for duck huntin if you're not familiar and I just wanted to show you this you know Winchester is a reputable brand you know I know this is their budget stuff okay but this is more than this so even though this is their budget stuff III have a problem with this we shoot wood ducks here in southeast North Carolina nothing but wood ducks very rarely do we see any mallards but uh you know there's I can already hear it all to shot for wood ducks Wow well that's what I shoot we shoot a lot of passing birds there hi I need to get distance I like this because all we need one pellet one pellet makes contact I'm good to go anyway I can already hear some more comments are gonna be made about well you need to shoot better well coming up with me and if you can hit a wood flying 60 mile an hour through the timber great teach me but until I see some videos of you dropping wood ducks left and right in the timber let's just not go there this has nothing to do with that this is strictly a video about how poorly this stuff is made it's horrible it's the most useless junk that I have ever fed through my shotgun yes I have killed ducks with this don't get me wrong it will still kill them but I'm just blown away by the absolute trash that they're putting in these shells so I wanted to show you now just so you know this is the same shot 3-inch one in one eight thousand umber two same thing let's go with this fielding stream if you can read that one and 1/8 ounce 3-inch number-two shot these are the same kind of same kind of rounds now I'm doing this with my phone in the left hand work with my right so let's see how this works here I'll show you this shot alright I've counted these pellets this Winchester right here sorry this Winchester round right here has 121 pellets in it okay now let's take a closer look what do you see there is that nice round symmetrical pieces of steel shot no look good lord egg shape divot spits I mean look at that stuff and then my phone's not focusing great but I think that pretty much speaks for itself just look at it yeah it'll fly yeah if you hit your target it will probably go go in the inside and and cause some damage and yeah it'll probably cause a little more damage but I've done some tests with this stuff and at 40 yards which is a long shot and no doubt these will stick and I mean just barely stick into a piece of particle board you can rake your hand down the front of it and they'll fall off now let's take a look at the nine dollar field and stream shot and let's see if we can see a difference oh wow oh wow we have here nice symmetrical round looks like possibly even coated zinc coated possibly pieces of steel that is beautiful now any of you with a brain will be able to look at these two and know that one will fly truer will hold a better pattern and well one of them simply has more mass these being so odd shaped with pits all in them they're not gonna be consistent in weight by no means whereas these are so your shot string if you don't know what shot string is when you shoot a shotgun some pellets go out faster than others so let's pretend like this piece of paper towel is a body of water if you aim right here and shoot pellets we'll hit from here to way out here in a stream this is going to have a longer shot stream okay so you'll have a lot of slow pellets and some fast pellets the ones that are more round will fly faster because they'll cut through the wind better these pellets with all these funky divots and crevices and hits and at all this gum they're not gonna fly as good they're gonna you know good lord if you took a flat foot ball and threw it it's gonna it's gonna tell it whereas a round ball that's why to use round balls in muskets they fly they flew straighter and I've sat down and looked at these very closely when I was counting them they're very consistent they're they're virtually identical they almost look like I mean they almost look like bb's that you would buy for your child's BB gun they're so truly symmetrical compared to these come on Winchester what are you doing scraping this mess up off the floor tossing it in the shotgun shell and charging us $12 a box for it these guys ain't and just so you know this stuff imma show you assembled in the USA Fiocchi of America so this stuff it's pretty much Fiocchi branded for dicks with fielding string that's all it is but it's two dollars cheaper than this okay this says fifteen hundred feet per second this says 1550 I will guarantee you that that fifty feet per second is so greatly diminished by the poor quality of shot now there were too much shotguns and it doesn't take nothing great but if you knew how many wood ducks that I have lost this year shooting this junk right here I got these boxes just the other day and it was it was amazing the difference immediately I was shooting the same type of shots taking the same type of shot same distances but these birds shot with this shot they were just they were dying a lot quicker I didn't have as many cripples nowhere near as many cripples yeah if I was a great shooter and I could you know force pellets coming out of a tube to go exactly where I wanted them to go every time I would make one of these pellets hit the duck right in the head and that would be the end of it but I'm a human being so when I pulled the trigger on a shot they just kind of that's what happens I've got a extended range pattern master choke I'm not shooting you know junk equipment but I was shooting junk shot no doubt about it so I doubt I buy any more of this because I didn't really realize it I've never took any apart and paid any attention I've just shot it but this year we've had such a bad time losing cripples you know it's almost to the point to where when I go hunting my limits three birds I want to drop four or five because if I do maybe I find three because right here lately we're losing four to five Birds a trip me and my buddy that went over the morning we two of us we dropped six Birds we stopped shooting we found three we got some of this shot we went back and the very first day we shot this shot we dropped six birds we found five okay the sixth one was crippled and we had to shoot the water the difference was just unbelievable I just wanted to show the the shot that should speak volumes how beautifully round and symmetrical that shot is compared to this this just looks like they scraped it up off the floor when they were making whatever they're making and throwed it in here now let me address this they have hexagonal shot that's stacked inside of a shell to create more wound channels worse deeper wound channels or more violent wound channels in the ducts that's great no I haven't had good patterns with that stuff you may have and that's fine but when you buy steel shot that's meant to be round balls just like this none of these are even the same size I can't even look at these two for example let's pull these out this is not gosh knows this is hard to do I see cracks and some of this stuff if I can get him a stay still this is number two shot now let's talk to me I've got a possibly a number one or even a BB mixed in with the number two this one shot here is completely cracked in half I don't know if I was gonna be able to show you this but I'm gonna try yeah it's not gonna focus but that pellet right there is crack down the middle so it's probably bust open when it comes down the barrel I'm just shocked okay I had to post this because I'm so stunned yeah I know this is a I noticed a budget shot there's no doubt about that this is ridiculous Winchester my god you can do it why can't you your Winchester for God's sake make some good shot I can't afford to buy heavy shot where I would I can't afford to buy freaking dry locks at $18 a box at my local Walmart when I shoot a box a day you know we're not shooting decoying mallards so it's not simple killer would I shoot a lot of shells okay this stuff will now be my go-to shot if I have to order it I will order it this is just junk look at it okay I had to post that that's my rant I'm done I'm over we'll see you guys on the next video", "X8F_GloLPv8": "Hey everyone my name is aga tompkins\nwelcome back to my channel and if it's your first time here hi this\nvideo is about green bean casserole as you can\ntell by my green bean eyeballs\nthat's what we're doing today hope you guys like it it's definitely\nsomething that i enjoy and is super easy to make\nlast minute side tune in and check it out you'll need three cans of green beans\nthen you'll need one can of cream of mushroom soup\n3 4 cup of milk i just honestly eyeball it at this point\ni can tell what's 3 4 cup so as you can tell\ni pour it into the container that the cream of mushroom soup comes in\nand i can tell what's gonna be 3 4 cup\nwithout even measuring and lastly you will need\ntwo containers of the six ounce french fried onions original i'm almost doing an a recipe that's like\ntoo easy to be on here but i was in the mood for green makeup i was\nmaking them this weekend and i decided\nwhy not let's do this i mean i have so many recipes in mind that it's just like\ngonna be never ending and i may do the simplest\ndumbest stuff that everybody's like duh and\ni may do some stuff that's a little harder since i'm not a chef myself\nthere is a part of me that wants to kind of dig into\nrecipes for people that maybe aren't whizzes in the\nkitchen you know and that aren't confident or like teenagers\nthat are moving out on their own for the first time and never really had to make\nany of the stuff i'm gonna do from beginners all the way up to\nsome of my more intense recipes but i figure even though this one's\nreally easy it might be one that you didn't ever think to make as a side for\ndinner and although it is summer right now\nso it feels like this is not the right choice i hadn't gone grocery shopping\nand that was what was happening because what's great about\nthis recipe is that everything you need for it\nbesides the milk you can store in your pantry and have\non hand at any time in case of an emergency in a last minute\nah i don't have any food so i definitely made a wild last minute dinner that was\nlike this is what you get family i love you but that's all i got\nneedless to say i went shopping the next day\nand also since it's been summer they actually were so stoked on this dinner\nbecause i haven't made some like that during the summer at all because\nit's a little too hot to be doing all that but\nthat's what happened so like i said this is the easiest recipe\nout there period there's zero recipes that are\neasier duh oh i forgot to tell you guys you need butter or just something to grease whatever\nyou're baking it in you can use like a nonstick spray or whatever\nyou feel like so i do that first and then i dump in\nmy green beans all up in there three cans of green beans right into it plop in the mushroom soup\nit's like condensed so it'll like kind of plop out\nlike and then i add in the milk\nthen i kind of swoosh that all around in there as best as i can i add in some ground pepper\nthat's optional and then i mix it all together some more kind of like this but more sloppy\njust mix it up and then i add in the french fried onions\nand i mix it some more once it's all mixed i add the\nfrench fried green onions to the top and i cover it with aluminum foil so\nthat it doesn't burn the onions on top i've already preheated my oven to 350\ndegrees at this point and i pop that sucker in the oven you bake it for 35 minutes with the\naluminum foil on and then you take it off and i bake it\nfor another 10 minutes with it off you can do it the\nother way where you never put the french fried onions on top\nand then add the french fried onions on top the last five minutes so it's up to\nyou but the way i do it is i cover it so i mean both ways work for some reason i\nthink like it being like trapped in this little thing\nuh helps it it probably doesn't so you can do the other way but it's up to\nyou that's just the way i do it once it's done you take it out and\nit is just ready to go i like to do like a scoop where i take a\nlittle bit of the crunchy stuff so i sometimes i even use like a a soup spoon\nand kind of grab it from underneath and plop it out onto the plate\ni make this bad boy every thanksgiving one of the first things our daughter\nsaid was like this always reminds me of thanksgiving which\nis kind of nice when it's summer it kind of is like oh\nthat's nice thanksgiving's nice even though they're enjoying the summer\nthere's like a part of you that has like a nostalgia\ntowards thanksgiving so yeah in the summer bring in a little bit of\nyour thanksgiving vibes to switch it up a little bit and\nmake some green bean casserole because i'm foreign i never ate this\ntill i was like all grown up like super grown up i was\nlike what is this and where did it come from i fell in\nlove with it hope you all enjoy this easy green bean\ncasserole recipe and look it's easy\nbut delicious one of my kids doesn't even like mushrooms and he still loves\nit thanks for watching remember to subscribe like and comment\nwhat you think of this video and let me know if

how to convert from kilograms to pounds and from pounds to kilograms we're also gonna talk about what to do if we need to convert pounds and ounces into kilograms so let's begin let's say we have 15 kilograms how can we convert this number into pounds now the conversion factor that you need is this one kilogram is equal to two point two zero five pounds so anytime you wish to go from kilograms to pounds all you need to do is multiply the number by two point two zero five now if you need to go from pounds to kilograms what you need to do is divide by two point two zero five for those of you who like to get the answer quickly now for those of you who want to show their work here's how you can do it so let's start with this example let's convert fifteen kilograms to pounds step one is to write down what you're given on a fraction step to write another fraction now using your conversion factor you need to decide what goes on the bottom and what goes on top notice that we have kilograms on the top part of the first fraction so we want to put that same unit on the bottom part of the second fraction so this part of the conversion factor we're going to write it on the bottom so that these units cancel the other part we're going to put it on top of the second fraction and so that's how we could show our work converted from kilograms to pounds so it's going to be 15 times two point two zero five and the answer is 33 point zero seventy-five pounds so that's how you can convert from kilograms to pounds now let's try another example go ahead and convert 24 kilograms into pounds feel free to pause the video if you wish to and try that example so let's start with what we're given 24 kilograms and then for the next fraction we're gonna use the same conversion factor so we're gonna put this part on the bottom one kilogram so that these units cancel and then two point two zero five pounds on top of the second fraction so it's 24 times two point two zero five and the answer is 52 point nine two pounds so that's it for the second example now let's work backwards let's convert pounds into kilograms so using the same conversion factor go ahead and try that so when you want to go from pounds to kilograms you need to divide by two point two zero five so we have 12 pounds let's put it over one and this time since we have the unit pounds on top of the first fraction on the bottom part of the second fraction we're going to put this portion of the conversion factor so we're gonna write two point two zero five pounds here and then on top we're going to put one kilogram so the unit pounds cancel and because this number is on the bottom that tells us that we need to divide 12 by the number so 12 divided by two point two zero five gives us the answer looking for which is 5.44 two kilograms now let's try another example let's convert 19 pounds to kilograms go ahead and try that so following the same procedure we're gonna multiply 19 pounds by one kilogram divided by two point two zero five pounds so 19 divided by two point two zero five is equal to eight point six one seven kilograms so now you know how to convert from pounds to kilograms and from kilograms to pounds now here's the question for you let's say if we have 15 pounds and eight ounces how can we convert this to kilograms what do you think we need to do here now keep in mind that one kilogram is 2.2 zero five pounds in addition to that you need to know that our one pound is equal to 16 ounces so there's two conversion factors that you need so using those two conversion factors how can we convert 15 pounds and eight ounces into kilograms so go ahead and pause the video and think about it try to find a way to get the answer well the first thing we want to do is you want to convert ounces to pounds so let's do that a simple way to convert from ounces to pounds is 2/16 but let's set it up first so because we have the unit ounces on the top we're gonna put it on the bottom so we're gonna write this part on the bottom the other part we're gonna put it on top so the unit ounces cancel and it's going to be 8 divided by 16 which is 1/2 or 0.5 so 8 ounces is 0.5 pounds so 15 pounds and 8 ounces is going to be 15 point 5 pounds you just gotta take this number and add it to this one so what we're really doing is converting 15 point 5 pounds into kilograms now this is something we could do so let's go ahead and finish the problem so we're going to use this conversion factor now so 1 kilogram is equal to 2 point 2 0 5 pounds so the unit pounds will cancel and the math is going to be 15 point 5 divided by 2 point 2 0 5 and that gives us an answer of 7 point 0 to 9 kilograms so that's how you can convert from pounds and ounces into kilograms now let's try another example for the sake of practice go ahead and convert 14 pounds and 12 ounces into kilograms go ahead and try that based on a last example so let's start with 12 ounces let's convert that into pounds so keep in mind there are 16 ounces in a single pound so we need to divide 12 by 16 and this is gonna give us point seven five pounds next we need to combine these two numbers so we have a total of fourteen point seven five pounds so now let's take that number and let's convert it to kilograms so we know that one kilogram is equal to two point two zero five pounds so we could cross out the unit pounds and get our answer so it's gonna be fourteen point seven five divided by two point two zero five and so the answer is six point six eight nine kilograms and that's basically it for that example so now you know how to convert from pounds to kilograms kilograms to pounds and pounds and ounces into kilograms so that's it for this video that's all I got if you liked it don't forget to subscribe and thanks again for watching", "WG4ZFtl2eq0": "hi Christian radio kitchen and today I'm sharing a recipe for sunshine a lemon coffee cake be a perfect coffee cake for your Easter morning brunch or any time you're craving a lemon and I'm getting this out of our recipe book called 9 by 13 a plan for your pan it's full of all kinds of recipes and they all use the basic nine by thirteen inch pan now I sprayed my nine by 13 pan with cooking spray and I used about three tablespoons of flour and shook it around and remove the excess I am using the Raydor stoneware pan and it does make a really nice light fluffy cakes so once you get that done you can set that pan the side now before we get started you want to pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees and now in a large mixing bowl we're going to take one lemon cake mix and that's a 18 point 2 ounce package we're going to take 1 and 1/3 cups water 3/4 cup eggs substitute and three tablespoons of poppy seeds and then here I have 1/3 cup of unsweetened apple sauce so we're going to first beat this on low for 30 seconds and I'm just gonna straight scrape down the sides and now we're gonna beat it on medium speed for two minutes now we're going to pour half of that cake batter mixture into your number 13 pan and I like to measure mine out so this made about 5 cups so I'm gonna put in about 2 and 1/2 cups now back to your mixing bowl I washed it up it's all clean we're gonna add 8 ounce package of cream cheese that's been softened and a half a cup of powdered sugar now we're going to mix this medium speed until it's smooth now to that we're going to add a can of lemon pie filling this is a 15 and 15.75 ounce can now we're just gonna put that on stir and stir that into the cream cheese powdered sugar now we're going to drop teaspoon fulls of filling on top of our batter so once you have your teaspoons of the filling you just want to just kind of slightly spread that around and it's so pretty I love the taste of lemon I like how pretty it is I also heard if you paint your house yellow it will sell faster than any other color all right so now we're going to add our remaining batter to the top of this now we're gonna make a yummy crunchy tapping now in a small mixing bowl we're gonna mix 1/3 cup brown sugar fourth cup of chopped pecans I'm gonna add the cinnamon it's 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon I'm just going to mix all these dry ingredients together first and then three tablespoons flour chopped and mixes I'm using the Ray that server spoon has about 50 different uses you can serve with it you can stir with it you can whip with it you can strain with it it's just an all-around multi-purpose tool we're gonna add four and a half tablespoons of melted butter and then about 1/8 of teaspoon vanilla extract so now we're gonna sprinkle our brown sugar and thyme mixture over the top of our coffee cake so now it's ready to be placed in our preheated 350 degree oven for about 40 to 45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean so my sunshine lemon coffee cake is baked you'll want to let it cool completely I got a little impatient because it smells so good I cut mine a little early but I wanted to show you this glaze that we're going to put over the top so it's a half a cup of powdered sugar and then four teaspoons of lemon juice you just blend that together and this coffee cake has that creamy middle that's really good this glaze is gonna give it that extra lemony punch to it just drizzle it over the top if you want to drizzle it over in the pan you can do that you do want to keep the cake in the refrigerator but this is ready to serve that's just one of the yummy recipes in our 9 by 13 plan for your pan cookbook", "SuFAI7uzGQs": "[Music] hello welcome back to regular guys outdoors I'm Eric and I'm Chris Colorado spring turkey season is just around the corner so we're gonna get our shotguns pattern today we're gonna test out a load made by Kent it's a two and three-quarter inch 12-gauge number five shot here's an assortment of 12-gauge as we gathered up we got a Benelli super nova browning bps winchester SXP and the Mossberg 500 alright so when it comes to turkey patterns there's kind of two schools of thought one is the 10 inch circle and the other is the 3 inch circle we have both Illustrated here so on your chin its circle is gonna want at least 100 pellets in this 10 inch circle so but you don't want gaps in it if you start getting big gaps where you can start covering this and not touch a pellet still not a good pattern even if you get your 100 120 in there so on your 3 inch circle you're gonna want at least 10 pellets in this 3 inch circles it's a little more stringent but to be good so when you run into that range where you can no longer do that consistency that is becomes your max range for that shotgun choke load combo so we got our target set up at 30 yards here we verified it with a little rangefinder and just say if your shotgun eyeball pattern at 30 yards you probably don't want to use it as a turkey we got the Mossberg 500 here with factory modified choke gate pellets one in the three-inch here but the the main part of the shot went in in this area I think it would he got 10 on the 3-inch but this is a just a factory modified choke it isn't one of the fancy ones like a full factory choke or a turkey choke got the Pinelli supernova here with the factory full choke 16 pellets here on the three-inch got a few holes in here I mean just get it for up to get for up to thirty yards or anything after 30 yard you probably don't want to trust it too much so this is the bps browning bps with the karlsen's extra full turkey choke in it it's a it's just like one of the factory ones but it's extra full we got 15 holes in our three inch circle and it looks like the bulk of the pattern is is up here so this part is really nasty up here so there's a little potential on this particular combo a couple holes down around here but it might just pattern a little bit higher than then how I was aiming so we got the Winchester s XP with the HS strat undertaker choke I've got 19 pellets here on the three inches which is pretty good but most of it hit up here at our aim a little high and you know it's not a lot of holes in this pattern here I mean it's almost quite the cap but not quite so it's pretty good combination so we got the Winchester SXP here with the Carlson extended turkey choke we got 11 beads went in here on the three inches you can tell that I shot to the left but it's not too many holes in here nothing to worry about too much I mean there's some here and there but I still think it would be a great combination all right so we got the browning bps with a unknown brand extra full turkey choke up here you can see it's extended past the barrel we got 32 in this three-inch circle if you count these ones that are here half in half 32 now you can cover a couple spots with this if you try hard but man 32 in that 3 inch circle that's pretty darn impressive to me alright so now that we've shot some of these loads at 30 yards we're going to take the two we feel are the best we push the target out to 35 yards now we're going to shoot the reactive target and see what it looks like on a turkey head so we got the browning bps with that unknown brand extended extra full turkey choke in it we're out at 35 yards you can tell the pattern has opened up a bit it's not quite as dense in the middle but I think if you were to make a mistake and think your turkey was a 30 yards it was actually a 35 I think you'd be okay I think if you tried to push it past 35 you you'd be a little too dispersed in your shot pattern but that's not too bad 35 yards on the $8 box of shells so we got the Winchester SXP shotgun with the HS strut undertaker choke as you can see all this pink here it's about ten in the brain area a lot of devastations if it would be turkey there so I think this is pretty good you know winning combination this be the one I'd go so today we've been evaluating the Kent 12 and 3/4 inch turkey load and I got to say that has been a very good load it's shot very good or really really good and about everything we tried it in today I got the winning combination here with the Winchester SXP with the HS strut undertaker choke really decimated that turkey target out at 35 yards a lot of head shots there the runner-up here was the BPS with the unknown brand extended full turkey to extra full turkey choke in here I got to say I would give this a look best eight bucks I've spent on shot shells in a while as always thanks for watching we also do a review of Kent's 20-gauge load right here and a three-inch federal load right here subscribe to our channel we'd appreciate it [Music]", "A_vuoJtr71k": "hi everybody its Daphne from scrap and create and I know it's been a long time since I've been been online I've been kind of busy with a couple of things got a little bit of construction going on at my house so it's been very difficult to try to get any videos done with all the noise and dust and just chaos in general but I'm back to continue working on the graphic 45 eight and a half by eight and a half mini album featuring the dream line collection and in the last video I put together the two inside liners and today we're gonna start working on page one so I hope I have most everything cut out so it'll go pretty quickly so we're gonna start with a pocket page which I pre assembled as part of just the base album build tutorial so I'm not going to go over how to cover this but if you go to the playlist the base album build is part of the collection of this playlist for Dreamlands so with that I'm gonna go ahead and sit down and we're gonna get started and gosh I have to say I feel a little nervous it's been so long since I've done a video I feel very out of practice so hopefully this will go well and and you guys don't have something to work with here pretty soon and I'm hoping I also got in here with everything I need and it looks like it so so what are we doing on page one so page one and you've seen this in other albums that I've done before we're gonna have two flats a left and a right flap so I'm just setting aside all the designer paper so we can see the actual base page so excusing that aside so we have our our 8 by 8 pocket page we're gonna have a left and right flap and then on the very top of those flaps we're gonna have a pocket and inside the pocket we are going to use one or graphic 45s large tags now the large tag is a little too long for the 8x8 album so I'm going to be trimming these down a little bit I'll cover that when I get to it but I noted that the the rectangular regular tags too short and this one was too long so I'm choosing to use the long one and trim it down a little alright so with that let's go ahead and get started by putting down by first putting down the left and right flaps and of course I didn't get the tape on so I knew there would be something and where's my turret is I also wanted to share with everybody that we do have these in stock and I think I mentioned it in the last video this is a tape chair tool so I had previously used something that was called an omni grid which is used predominantly I think either in quilt-making or certainly in in the fabric space in general and it had a lot of gridlines on it and to me it was just a little too hard to look at so with a friend of mine Martha Jackson she came up with this little template or I provided a template and she actually created this for me with on one of her machines that cuts a laser machine that cuts through acrylic so what you see here are two lines so there's the edge and then the first line is 1/8 inch mark and the second line is 1/4 inch mark so I use those as reference just as I'm moving through the album just to make sure things aren't drifting up or down but then what I mostly use this for is to tear my tape so enough of that let me show you how I use it and like I said these are available in our shop and it comes with the pop socket and the base and it was actually a tool that I developed kind of out of necessity and used that Omni grid just because that's what I had and then put what I consider to be a handle on top so I'm liking this a little better of course if you have the Omni grid I mean by all means continue to use it but it was just difficult for me there was just too many grid lines on it in general it was just very hard to pick a line and then try to stay on it so I think the solid line a solid simple line with just a couple reference lines works better for me and those are really the only two measurements I used on the omni grid oops anyway sorry for all the racket so I just simplified it and it's for sale in our shop and I'm not going to tell you the price because I'm afraid my partner might change the price and I'm not even sure what it is right now but I can't tell you it's cheaper than buying the Omni grid we made it more affordable than if you were gonna buy the Omni grid which by the way isn't a very inexpensive piece of acrylic it's kind of expensive for what you get and it doesn't come with a pop socket and I should have drank that this first so I'm gonna go ahead and flip it over and make sure yeah it looks good make sure that it's gonna fit on the page so the pocket is here so I'm applying it to the left so the spine side and the outside pocket space and I'm just going as close to the edge as possible squaring off the page itself okay so that's one put the second one in and then we'll actually get to start laying down some designer paper I'm excited so I've been very anxious to get on camera again but there's just been too much noise and I'm having my son's bathroom redone and between the noise and the what feels like constant interruption I just couldn't get anything done so I was just dry kidding to make sure it's the same height and it's not gonna hang over and it looks good oops that didn't grab all right there we go okay so now we have these two vases in so the next thing I want to do is apply these two pockets to the outside here and I'm just doing them side by side to make sure there's no interference and it looks good I need to get some tape on here so I also want to give you a heads-up that it is an airshow weekend here in San Diego so but I may get drowned out a couple of times I'm actually right in the flight path I live very close to the base Miramar just a couple miles away and when they're looping around to come back over the air base they actually come right over my house so you may hear some of that and it'll be unmistakable it'll be quite loud if they come over on Sunday I'm not sure but they have been doing it for the last couple of days so just heads up on the noise or the possible noise there goes a cloud taking up my son so I'm gonna add a little artificial light here there we go not the best I prefer natural light but I'm so far behind I just I'm happy to be sitting down working at all so hey I also want to let you guys know I'm back to my jibber-jabber self apparently YouTube just came out with this new feature which is way way overdue in my opinion as a content creator I think most people like myself do their best to try to stay on top of comments I always want to respond to you guys for a couple reasons one if you have a question I don't want to out there and - oops I think we want that to happen and - sometimes you'll tell me or give me tips that I'm not familiar with so I want to take advantage of that so anyways back to YouTube YouTube just delivered and it's still in test right now this new feature that allows me to go look at all the comments that you guys have provided and narrow it down to the ones that I have not responded to which up until now I've not been able to do so if I miss something and a couple of weeks goes by it's buried so low that it's hard for me to find anyway so I just they just released this feature limited and fortunately I can see it so some of you may be wondering why am i responding to such old comments and that is why because I am going through and I'm making sure that I read every comment that was ever put out there and if I somehow had missed it I'm responding to it now so I'm just giving you a heads up I know it's old some of the questions I'm sure I've already answered or that you've moved on but that's that's why you're finding these comments or responses for me that are two three four six eight months old because I've missed things and I'm trying to go clean that up so when I go look at comments that I have not responded to they're relevant and new and I'm up to date so just a heads up I've been working on that for the last two days and it looks like I might be working on it for a little while longer because there are quite a few but my goal is to get to all of them and you there's no need for you to respond I just want you to know that I've gotten the comment and that I see it so the other reason it's important for me to do that is the last reason I guess is YouTube has lots of algorithms that will help me get my word out and get me on other people's radar in terms of possible videos or recommendations and one of the things that they consider when determining you know how to make recommendations is you know what the popularity of your channel is and whether or not you're actively responding to your your audience and so that's the other reason of why I want to be up to date because I want to be responding to my audience and I want to get the benefit from that so just FYI that's what's going on if you see something come across that you you know what I didn't do a very good job making that even so I'm gonna have to come back and trim that piece out or am i hmm it's pretty close so I'm gonna let you guys see so if you look very closely these two don't come across straight but it's so close I think I'm gonna go ahead and leave it but those are the kind of things that kind of bother me if I wasn't so far behind schedule I think I might actually undo this and redo it but but I am woefully behind schedule okay so here's what I have planned and I just realized this this is what happens when I don't record for a while I completely lose my mojo and forget how I did this so I'm gonna back up right now and tell you the two flap sizes so this is a left and a right flap and it's four and a half by eight four and a half by eight it's eight inches this way four and a half across the top and then you're gonna score a half-inch for the hinge itself so that is the measurements of the left and right flap so same measurement you're going to need two four and a half by eight score at half inch for the bottom I've wrote it two different ways four and three quarter by five or five and so it's kind of funny that I wrote it both ways but you're going I didn't write the score line so I really am out of it I have to retrain myself so let's see so four so it's five inches across and 4 and 3/4 length and you're going to score half-inch on three sides so again it's 5 inches across and you're going to score a half inch on either side of that 5 inches so when you're done you've got a four inch here and then this is four and three quarters you're gonna score half-inch and you should have a finished panel of four and a quarter by four so four and a quarter by four when you're finished and that's what these two things are for and I apologize for not covering that before I started moving our head to put down the designer paper and I'll try to be mindful of that moving forward okay so here's the picture that I chose um and I have to think about this but I'm pretty sure I'm pretty darn sure that this is from the twelve by twelve collection pack and when I go through the walkthrough I'll verify that but I'm pretty sure this is from the twelve by twelve pretty sure it's from the twelve by twelve pack but like I said I'll verify that and I'll try to cover that all this was fresh in my mind week and a half ago when I started this when I'm going through the construction process moving forward when I'm working with the graphic 45 and I'm using a twelve by twelve collection pack and an eight by eight I'll try to tell you as I'm laying the designer paper down which one of the pads it came from of course you can always substitute but I'll at least tell you what I'm doing so you can be cutting from the same pack I'm just gonna give it here we go this will help me see my edges a little more clearly all right there we go there's one piece so the other piece is gonna go here and I think I'm actually going to leave this like so so I can actually make this line go straight across and you'll see what I mean in just a second oh and here's another reminder and I sent an email out to all our subscribers on our our shop page but I'm gonna let you guys youtubers know whether you buy from us or someone else stock up on your art glitter glue as soon as we get into the freezing temperatures or below 40 our glitter glue will won't ship their product and they won't warranty the product if we ship it so stock up before it cools down that's just a heads up and also I the this is the old format for the 4 ounce the 4 ounce now comes in a longer slumber slimmer bottle which is much easier in my opinion to handle so I'm really liking the new format I'm gonna use up what I have but I'm anxious to start using the new format which was one of the reasons why I really like the 2 ounce was because I just like the size of that bottle in my hand so if you didn't see what I was doing I was using this edge and pushed pushing it against the designer paper and then pushing this one up so that you get that nice consistent line it was especially important here because I pointed out that the pockets aren't exactly the same size so visually I'm going to make up for that by making sure these two designer sheets are exactly lined up so and you can do that with anything that has a sharp flat edge or of course you can use one of these okay so this is the cream cardstock there's always one sheet in the collection pack and most of the time I try to make use of it not always most of the time so that is what this is and I want this to be fairly simple and in a minute it'll be evident from right so I'm just double-checking to make sure they fit and that I can slide them slightly inside the pocket and I like that because when I go to put something in the pocket it won't get hung up on the edge of the hinge if whatever's on top is just slightly over that edge so once these are in I am gonna use these tags to go into the pocket that's why it's okay to have this be so simple okay excuse me okay all that looks good so another thing I want to point out is I always ink my edges and I use these powder puffs at ink ink pads which I really like they're called chalk ink I like them for a lot of reasons one of the reason I biggest reasons is it doesn't transfer onto me like many other inks that I've used in the past also you don't need a separate applicator you can actually just apply it from the pad that's attached to the container so that's just one less thing for me to keep track up but what I was going to point out is I've inked the edges of the designer paper but I did not ink the edges of the cream paper I'm just not a huge fan of inking everybody's different it's so that's personal preference but I kind of like the crispness of a solid piece of paper here so that's really entirely up to you but I just wanted to point it out alright I am ready to get some glue on you oh look I have a little arrow that's telling me which way oh and I was gonna put it in the wrong way I think sometimes I'll do that when the paper is you know not not quite square and this one was not quite square and I almost did the same thing so it actually fits better this way so no pattern to tell what direction it is so I just put that little cheap on the back okay oh I have some other exciting news so Janet is this Janet Mueller's a subscriber from Australia and I had exchanged some comments with her through YouTube and then she came on over to our Channel and I was so excited to find out that she he has family here in San Diego so she's here now yay hi Janet and Janet is gonna come to our retreat here in San Diego and that's exciting she's our first international customer for the retreat so that's kind of neat she actually was gonna head home but then was able to change her plan so she can stay in and play with us so I'm kind of excited about that so our retreats a really very small quite quaint we cap out of 25 people between the YouTube channel and the shop it keeps us so busy with shipping and customer service that it's harder to get away get more time to plan larger events or to even get away for that long it's it's usually kind of treacherous even to take that many days off from shipping but anyways they are fun but they are small and of course they sell out because they are so small but I was really thrilled that she was able to make it and I hope she has a good time with us she was very knowledgeable very nice she used to own her own [Music] scrapbooking store and also to classes so we have a lot in common which i think is pretty safe to say that's our whole community right okay that's in how's it looking guys looking good so I also started taking apart and looking at and shuffling through the life is a journey paper and I know it's not everybody's cup of tea but I'm loving it so I'm really anxious to get something going so I've started kind of getting my head wrapped around what to do with that paper so that's gonna come next and then after that it's gonna be a flip between either romantique la romantique which is another graphic 45 the DCE that just came out or maybe doing something with stamp area I'm not sure okay so as you can see this is too long for the pocket that I have here the book is eight and a half inches the pocket page is eight so I'm gonna need to turn something off this so I'm going to turn it over push it in get it flat and then I'm going to mark where I want to trim this and I want it to come down just a little bit below this white paper so I'll tell you how much I'm cutting off in just a second because I didn't measure it I just did what I showed you I turned it turn it upside down but I'll tell you it is I just took one and a half inches off so we're gonna test that and see how it looks and yes that's I like it so I wanted a little space up here and that's how that's turned out so I'm gonna do the same thing here only this time instead of measuring it off the pocket I'm just gonna measure it off the tag so now from tip to bottom it's about seven and a half inches it's actually slightly less than that so now I'm gonna need to trim these down because I use the die to cut these and that means these are too long as well so these need to be trimmed down just a little bit and I am going to use my pencil to mark it and trim it and then we'll cover these tags okay double check how does that look I think I should take a little bit more it's very cool very very cool okay all right now I need to ink this I didn't do that after I took it out of the dye and I think I got in here without it but this is the graphic forty five large tag dye and it comes with a large tag and the very small ATC tag die and then flower dies which I used also and if I had my corner rounder in here I'd probably round all these corners but I don't have it handy so I'm not gonna stop to go get it tomorrow my house will be full of contractors and noisy again so I need to get as much done today for you guys as I can and that might mean taking a couple short steps like not going and getting my corner rounder [Music] after all the noise I've had for the last two weeks it's kind of eerie it's so quiet now all right looks so pretty I haven't covered the back and I think I'm going to but I'm not gonna do that right now because there's still a few pieces that need to be cut and I don't know how much paper or which papers I have left yet so for now I'm going to just leave the back length which will be fine either way but I think I will come back and cover it with something once I know really where I'm at in terms of paper how much paper is left okay we'll need to trim this one as well so I'm gonna put lay this in get it set double check looks good well ink it and glue it get it down and then we're gonna open our doors and then figure out where to put our magnets and also lay in the designer paper and wrap up page one as a heads up page two is a waterfowl page I think I actually design page two and three to go together but I can't decide which way I want me to go if two is gonna be three or three is gonna be - I don't know I'm gonna lay them out we're gonna decide together no I got it I'm good I'm about ready for glue myself because it can tell it's getting thicker on me when I get down to the bottom of a 4-ounce it's it starts to get a little thick because it takes takes a while to go through a four ounce bottle all right let's see what else is going on guys I can't really think of a whole lot the weather's really beautiful here right now and I am excited about our retreat which is at the end of October so that's right around the corner and I don't usually do this but I'm gonna I mean I always do making takes for the retreat but I don't usually do a YouTube forum and I think this time I'm going to so I'm going to do a couple of small videos with cards that we're gonna use for the making of take there we go I have to I want to make sure it's not getting hung up on the there it is so this one is getting hung up on the hinge down here that's holding the pocket together so I just need to get it to good go on top of that that's why it's so much taller there we go there we go after I train it a few times it'll want to slide in the right place okay so let's get this on cuz it's drying out on me that is that is the front of page one I am going to put something on these grommets I just don't know what yet and this collection has been so popular I had to give up my charms and my ribbon to Julie to ship to a customer so as soon as we get some more stuff in and before I finish and do the walkthrough I'll come back and show you what I'm gonna do but I'm thinking of two ribbons with maybe a little charm dangling off each one I just think that's pretty ok here we are lots of space to work with so I think this is what I had planned I'm pretty sure yeah so this is what I used on the front here and then this is just the flip side and again this is 12 by 12 from the 12 by 12 so you could use either side here's what I'm planning to do as far as the flaps just two very simple flaps so we have that's one side and there's the flip side and I actually think I'm going to go with this and here's why I like this pattern better but I think I'd have a hard time putting a picture on it so I'm going to flip it over and then I won't have to struggle so much to put a picture of it so this is going to be the completion of page one once we get these down now pre inked everything I'm just gonna go through and dry fit make sure everything's looking good before I apply some glue yeah I think so let's just double check there is a cut list in the description so if you click or if you scroll let me back up maybe I had too much coffee just underneath the video box itself there is a description and there's usually just a little blurb about the shop and maybe a link to our website which is our shop then there it says show more if you click the show more and scroll down the first thing you're gonna see is material list what it took to make this album with some links to our shop and we hope you consider buying from us but it's not required great and then keep scrolling and you're gonna come to the cut list and the cut list will cover everything that's interactive about this album it does not cover the base album itself for the base album go back to the playlist find the base album tutorial and it will have all the build components for the pocket pages the covers the spine the hinge and all of that so what you're gonna find in terms of a cut list under this video is just the interactive pieces that are sitting on top of an eight and a half by eight and a half base album it's a little bit confusing I know but it really saves me a lot of time not having to rebuild the eight and a half by eight and a half generic book for every album for you guys so I appreciate your patience but go to the playlist and it should be an order you should have a walkthrough a base album build whatever size it is in this case it's eight and a half by eight and a half and then when it says tutorial one that's the tutorial that's adding the flaps and pockets and the designer pieces if you scroll down in the description of the tutorial one that's where you'll find these flap and pocket measurements thankfully all the tutorials are organized the same way so once you figure it out for one you've got it mastered for all and I encourage you to use the playlist and save yourself some time so you're not searching around for the videos they're all grouped together so there's usually four tutorials per album and they're all in one place for you to use so you can just go one video to the next and not have to go searching for you know tutorial two or two 4:03 they're right there so please do take advantage of that and the way to get to those playlists is from our channel page go to scrap and create and right underneath our banner there's a couple of menu options and one of them is playlist and click on that and every every project we've ever done has got a playlist with you know anywhere from three to six videos associated to it and the playlists are titled with a paper that's used so that should help you if you've got some paper and you're trying to figure out what to do with it of course you can use any one of our tutorials but if you have some that specific like a graphic collection look up that name and there's a good chance that it's been released in the last two years that we have a tutorial building a mini album with it and we also have stamp Rio - Ciao Bella as well and they're just all in order the way they're listed on there they're in order by the most recent one is the one gonna see first there's also a tips and had to double-check make sure I was putting flu on the right side there's a tips and tools tutorial and there's not much in there but one of the things that's in there is how to use an edge die in your albums which has been kind of popular but if you haven't seen it take a look it's really quick I think it's 15 minutes maybe less on how to use an edge die and how to get your designer paper to map perfectly on top of the edge die once it's turned out so hopefully that'll be a oh my gosh you guys I've been jabbering and I didn't put my magnets in how could you let me do that sorry about that too much jabbering okay I need to figure out how I'm gonna keep this closed dummy okay I'm gonna need two magnets and I have to figure out how to get them here so I'm probably gonna put a designer strip that splits this so that I can get a magnet behind it so as you can see you can always you can always figure out a way around it but it's best to keep your keep your mind on what you're doing in the first place do what I say not what I do sorry about that guys so hopefully you're not doing exactly what I'm doing and you're at least a few minutes behind me so you don't make the same mistake alright I'm gonna go ahead and stick these down because like I said I'm gonna put a decorator strip across to mask it so now I do want them because the strip is gonna cover it I want them in the same place so I'm gonna make a quick reference line maybe mm-hmm okay so I'm just gonna Center it it's eight inches so we're gonna break it up put a strip in at four inches on both sides dum-dum that's okay I think it'll actually look better with a strip across it instead of just a solid panel but but it's not like we have a choice anymore okay now I'm going to put the matching line on the other side I'm gonna hard time get my ruler flat there we go here we go okay put a magnet somewhere on that line and then we're gonna do the same thing on this side keep picking up the magnet okay yeah that looks good all right so we are looking good okay I'm just gonna put it toward the edge not too far out so that I'm worried about buckling cover my glute buckling the edge of whatever strip I put over it so I'm not gonna put it too far to the edge so maybe right about there so 2/3 2/3 across and if if you're a little bit behind me you don't have to do this at all you just put it under this panel right and I'm just using my reference line to Center and like I said I'll put a 1 inch or inch and a half strip over it when I'm finished it's not the right one here we go okay now we need to find where to locate these so thank goodness I caught it before that took hold silly me good night like I said I am just kind of lost it out of the groove okay okay I'm gonna cover all four of these with some tape to soften the edges um it also it's very helpful I'm just gonna put a big piece across here you know to glue doesn't want to dry on the metal so it it ensures that he's into whatever you put on top of it and that there's not a bubble over your magnet okay let's do over its to do what we're [Music] and then putting glue over the tape right now the tape is extremely tacky so if any part of this paper goes down upon the tape in the wrong spot you can't lift it it'll tear the paper so so I always if when I'm doing something like this I want to get glue on the tape so I've got a few minutes to torque it into place which I might eat or will probably need it sounds very crunchy because of a dry glue that'll get better a bit okay well there you go come along these straight edges out of the way now we need to find a strip to go over this so I am going to look first at some here's a little basket that I have that helps me stay organized so what I'm gonna look at first is whether or not I've got a scrap that I can use that will fit without you know having to cut into a big piece of paper so I'm gonna try a couple of different things where you guys are with me here and we will find something together so one of the options is this which is off the twelve by twelve and here's a larger piece of it actually this is the 8 by 8 so on the flip side of this paper there are these cut aparts and this one is actually you can see the difference so this is from the twelve by twelve and this is from the eight by eight and I like the twelve by twelve size better but I'm not sure I like it so I'm gonna keep looking and see if I like something better it's too busy so really I think because of this paper yellow or blue or is what I'm looking for oh here's an option to you yellow or blue is what I'm looking for and I think I like this one so now I'm gonna find another piece of it it's on the orange patterned paper so if I can't find another strip of that there it is so this is actually part of the this is from the 8x8 pad pad so it's one of those trips from the 8x8 pad that's what I'm going to use to cover this up so hang tight I'm gonna get this trimmed off and I'm trimming it right below the blue line okay so it was like this so you can see I've got the Stars just on this side so if you're gonna do the same thing or you may have already put it under the panel but if you did the same mistake this is the trim line where I'm cutting which is just below that dark blue with the blue with a gold stars so now we need to shorten it so that it fits on here with wise okay let's see how we did okay looks good I'm gonna get some ink on that so you can either put it down as is or you can put some black cardstock behind it and mat it which looks nice also setup so your other option to and is to just glue down the sides and have it be a belly band I I think I'm gonna glue it down completely just because I don't want anything slipping through here and catching on the magnet even though it's covered with with double-sided tape I'm worried that something might get hung up on it so I'm gonna go ahead and glue this down firmly trim this piece up first it's yes it does okay get some ink on this so before I put it down I'm actually going to put this trimmed off from the tag I'm just gonna set it behind it and it's lay it down here and look what it looks like matted I wouldn't use this piece but you can see how it kind of pops more than this in fact I like it so much I'm gonna stop here and go get some black paper so I can do that because I just think that makes it look so much better and I think it'll also soften the look of the magnet that's behind it so I'm gonna pause for a second go get some black paper I'll be right back okay I'm back so people often ask me and since I'm getting ready to do it I'll share with you what do you do with all your scraps well I I save them for either photo mats or scraps that I can use to back things like stickers and small strips so I I save almost everything some of it sometimes it gets out of hand I go through and I get rid of anything that's shorter than four inches and narrower than an inch but even oftentimes that is still large enough to use on a sticker if I want to stiffen the sticker up instead of just applying the sticker directly and one of the reasons I like to put stickers on black cardstock is I like to fussy cut around them because I like the look but the other reason is the stickers don't seem to want to stay down they want to peel back up I don't know what it is about that adhesive but it doesn't feel permanent so if you are gonna put stickers directly on your album I would recommend adding glue to it as well because it will peel up okay and because this is so small I am going to trim it by hand because it won't fit in my trimmer very well so I'm going to show you real quick so you can see I didn't really leave a black border on here and the reason is because I've trimmed it so that the black border is going to be exposed from this mat anyway and if I added another black border it would be inset so just FYI okay not very elegant it's just a box cutter but my exacto knife is sold up so dull I can't use it right now sure there you go I don't know what it is about is back tone nice but they don't seem to stay sharp as long as my box cutter also when my box cutter gets dull I take a fingernail file and sharpen the edge and a blade will last me years sorry I was trying to find my pick tool alright so I'm going to leave one down and then I'm going to get a straightedge to carry it across to get the other one in the same position and there's my one or my four-inch reference line and I'm gonna Center it on this but you could go up or down but I'm just gonna try to Center it there we go problem solved right there it is the other reason I wanted to trim the black level is I don't want that any of that to get into the hinge area so that's the other reason why it's a little bit shorter okay I might actually have enough left of the scrap I cut off mmm-hmm I do so that's perfect so I'll get this adhered and then I'll trim the other side okay get my straightedge and I just need to take a little sliver off this is always a little challenging especially if you're using a cork back because the cork doesn't go all the way to the edge so what I would recommend is you didn't using a flat edge that is totally flat I do not like using this particular ruler because the blade can cut into it but if I don't a paper underneath it could shift and I just had a panic attack that I forgot to turn the video on but it's running so yay alright we're almost I promise we're almost done with page one and what I usually do is number my pages and put the spine orientation on them when I get started and I didn't do that but I am gonna I am going to moving forward I didn't do it for page one but I am gonna mark page two and which side the spine is supposed to be on so that so I don't get anything in upside down okay I'm just gonna do a little housekeeping here and then we're gonna walk through what I did okay so this is the inside of page one and here's the closed position and like I said there's nothing on the back of the tags but I'll probably come back and put something on them once I finish the album and know what kind of scrubs I have left I am gonna put some ribbon here but I had to give up my ribbon because we were it was so popular we were actually running out of ribbon to give to the customers so I'm pretty happy with the way that turned out this is page one there's the pocket this will be the spine side so this is page two and when we come back we'll get started on page two but I'm gonna leave you with one more thing before I go and that is this is page two this is the spine so that when I come back and sit down I keep track of where the spine is where the pocket side is and what page number I'm on I'm gonna go ahead and number the rest of my pages as well but I'm done for now I'm gonna go get this uploaded and then I'll be back with page two", "Cnb1oPD_YBQ": "I'm out here today I've got the target downrange down here well I've got the Mojo choke tube on the Benelli and I figure while is out here be cool to do a little comparison video pretty much myself and I think my whole team uses the Winchester long beard XR well I went ahead and picked up the double X and I've got the winchester super X two kind of shooting down ranch just to compare those and I'm gonna show you guys the results of that at the end of this video [Music] [Music] I'm pretty much shot my shoulder off and this was the last one I did here this is the five shot long beard XR and I was just doing it from 30 yards I did everything from 30 yards you can see I was a little off there but that's open sights and everything holds a really really tight pattern and this holds a tight pattern I can vouch for it up to you know 60 yards even and that mojo choke there's a heck of a job combined with that well I try to lay him out where you can see them as best as you could a shot pretty much three-inch of everything except the XRS I already had them at three and a half inch and didn't want to buy them in three-inch but I had the devil X that is the six shot that did really well it's pretty impressed with that and then you had the Winchester Super X which of course just didn't hold the pattern even anywhere close to compared to the double X or the long beard XR and of course the long beard XR I shot the four shot and the five shot both hold a really close close pattern and if you like taking those longer shots or if you like to hit exactly where you aim that is the ammo for you now if you like to have a little bit wider shot then you might want to look at the devil X or even the Winchester Super X but all three have done great and I was pretty impressed by them [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "eqdS598Ygwo": "[Music] hi I'm Chuck Dorsett for Weaver leathercraft and we are going to make two gorgeous leather journals now right off the bat two big points to this video first off leather work is just elements and they are all easy to learn so we're gonna break this down into chapters that way you can see every tool and exactly what it does second big point though sky is the limit with design we're gonna use one design we're gonna drop in this beautiful feather pattern but the coolest thing about this I love this pattern but we don't have to be top-notch tools to make that gorgeous every time I'm gonna show you exactly how to do that now any tool any liquid any leather I use in this video weaver leather craft comm or check below we've got links they're gonna take you straight to the website now first step in any project we're going to make our patterns so let's step over here and start on that now let's start with our field journal because this can be a pretty good size pattern when we lay this out but this is super easy because all I'm going to do here is take my insert or my journal I can measure that out or I can simply lay that in and draw a broken line because that's not our cut line that's our actual size our pattern line is out here we're going to add 3/8 of an inch all the way around which makes this a great pattern easy it's gonna fit just about any journal you have we're going to add 3/8 because we're gonna sand so on all four sides to sew our flap in so that gives us 1/8 of an inch for our stitch line and 1/4 of an inch so that our journal or our insert will fit in comfortably now with our flaps I'm gonna bring this in three inches one trick here is I don't want to bring this flap in too far because the further in I bring this the more someone is going to have to bend the spine to insert this say we've got an old family Bible I don't want them to have to do that to get this into our journal cover so for this let's go 3 inches in from our edge not from our size not from our journal edge but from our pattern edge so I'm going to drop in marks and lines three inches in from each side and there we go okay so our flaps are in now I've got a flat panel here again to save us a little time that's three by nine and a half easy enough but here's a small trick I'm going to over cut this because when we glue this down to sew it I'm going to cut that panel or trim the panel down using the body as my straight edge what that will give us is a cut that looks just like it was die-cut so we've got three by nine and a half as our actual size but we're going to add quarter-inch to our three so that's three and one-quarter inch and then nine and a half is our length so we're gonna add 1/2 of an inch quarter inch each end so that's ten inches so cut to three and a quarter by ten easy enough there now one more piece we need to talk about or one more element so we're going to add a rivet and a button post now with our rivet I don't want to set that inside my flap now I could hey I could drop in a piece of marble behind that set my rivet or be I can set my rivet before I sew it the problem is this tab is going to be flapping around while I sew it and that's relatively irritating okay so let's just let's make this easy we're gonna drop our rivet in outside of our flap so we've got three inches there let's simply come in another half-inch make a mark circle that and we're gonna call that rivet now I've also labeled this back in front to keep us from getting confused now we're going to come around to our front with the same brown that simply screws in easy enough so I don't really have to set that like a rivet so I can drop that in under my flap and I'd like that maybe a little bit closer to my edge so let's go one and a half inch in from there let's drop that in and put button post there we are easy enough cool our pattern literally is making itself now one more piece our billet now we need three and a half inches here we need to make a three-quarter inch Bend and then one and a half inch here now I want to add a little extra room because we need a tab here but what we're going to do is want this once this is sewn we're gonna drop in our insert and I'm going to bring this around tight mark it and then punch it that assures me that I will have a good fit every time so let's do this let's write in bill it 3/4 inch width by 7 inches that's going to give me plenty of room for a tab well easy enough there's our pattern so let's do this I'm gonna lift this up cut it out we're gonna pull this out and work on our feather now with feathers I love the feather design first off looks great but it is super easy like I said we don't have to be a top-notch tool or we don't even have to be an artist all you have to do go online search feather silhouettes and then hit images you are going to get all manner of feathers but because that's the silhouette it's going to be easy to trace out so you can print that you can size it proportionally to your project and feathers will fit all manner of shapes and sizes now I'm not going to drop this on our pattern because I can use this anywhere I'm simply going to trace this onto my tracing paper and I can use it on any project size I've got 12 inches here even a small feather would look great or a fault a small feather in the corners all manner of ways to go here but let's drop in two feathers we're gonna add in a little tooling or stamping to make it look like a conch oh and drop in an initial so let's take our tracing paper drop this in over our pattern tape that down and now here's two tricks we're going to use tools first off we need a good even circle and I will never draw a circle freehand easily but what I can do is take my template and our circle is done alright easy enough their second trick to these is a French curve because our quill that's the one thing that does need to be clean and straight and a I'll never hit that freehand so what I can do is drop in my french curve and simply trace that quill in so I'm going to trace all four sides there and quills are done let's add a nice little detail there okay so we're already halfway there now I'm simply going to freehand trace right onto my tracing film but again does not have to be spot-on perfect and my last line there we go not perfect does not have to be but that looks great now one point two I'm not going to drop this actually on to my pattern for my portfolio because I can use this anywhere it will fit I'm going to take this when we're done drop this into my artwork folder and I can pull that out any time I need a feather back the tracing film what a great material great tool all right so our feather is done and ready to go what we're going to do now is move this out and we're just going to take a quick peek at the pattern for our portfolio because in all honesty it's the same thing as our field Journal now there we go okay like I said this pattern is huge and it's hard to try to get it in the camera shot but here's the cool thing no different than our field Journal exact same measurements now I've dropped in my spine here in case we want to add a name or some initials or maybe some tooling perfect place for that but 3/8 of an inch all the way around flaps we're going to go four inches instead of three but again we're gonna over cut those by a quarter of an inch and last thing we're not going to use any closure here I'm not big on a closure on a large portfolio so cool our patterns are done let's jump over to our main table and cut some leather alright we've got our pattern cut down to size so really all I need to do is drop this in and Mark's great pattern straight lines we're going to use a 12 by 24 inch chrome tan distress now this is the coffee beam it's a beautiful color but the panels are great inexpensive and I can get ample room for my my journal cover now one point I can certainly draw all the way down my edges with my all but that's not a great pattern paper that's just copy paper but I use that in the videos because we've all got some easy to make a good pattern now if this pattern fits and it's good I'll transfer this over to some thicker paper but also to what we need to do we're going to be careful here let's read our patterns before we cut because our our actual size on our flap is three by nine and a half but we're going to cut two three and a quarter by ten inches need to be careful of that so all I need to do is mark with my all my corner points and with my straight edge just cut between those and they're easy enough to see with a good all now let's cut this out I'm going to cut my main body out and my two panels then we'll jump over to our veg to annal and my last piece three-quarter inch by seven that pattern is ready to go so let's do this let's set that aside we're going to jump over to our larger portfolio now I'm going to use the four to five ounce Hermann oak 12 by 24 inch sheet but notice - I'm not going to be able to get the whole pattern out of this but I can simply order a second one and I'm there so with this perfect fit look at that spot on 12 inches just what we're looking for now just like our first pattern I'm simply going to mark and mark and cut then I'm going to jump into a second panel to get my two my two flaps from but let's be cautious here again our actual four by 12 we're going to cut four and a quarter by twelve and a half so I'm going to cut those out also two on the billet no need we're not going to use one and my last cut second panel piece or flat piece is ready to go again how easy could these patterns be all straight lines and easy yes but here's the biggest point you'll notice this chapter is almost twice the length of any other chapter in our project videos because our pattern we need to take our time there if we do we take our time and we measure correctly every step from here on will fit into place will not only have a better time with it but our project will look like we took the time but will actually end up saving time because we don't have to cure mistakes so let's do this follow me to chapter 2 and we're going to do our edge work", "aGVuObJih14": "Shot sizes are one of most confusing aspects\nof the shotgun world. For newcomers, all those arbitrary letters and numbers are an utter\nmystery; and even many experienced shooters can\u2019t keep track of all the different sizes,\ntheir diameters, and how they\u2019re organized. And every shot size chart or table I\u2019ve\ncome across is incomplete in one way or another. So I figured I\u2019d kick off this new video\nseries with an exhaustive, two-part video guide that covers all of the American shot\nsizes, common and uncommon. I\u2019ll explain the various formulas and naming conventions,\nand touch briefly on what the different sizes are used for.\nI\u2019ll explain some basics and try to keep things easy for newcomers to follow, but even\nexperienced shooters should be able to learn something new here.\nNow, the American shot size system isn\u2019t the only one in the world, but trying to include\nothers in the same video would just be confusing - especially with birdshot, where the same\nnumbers and letters refer to different diameters in different systems.\nA majority of my viewers live in areas that predominately use American shot sizes, so\nthat\u2019s what I\u2019ll cover first. Other shot size systems will get their own videos later\non. I\u2019ll get to specific sizes shortly, but\nfirst, some definitions and background: For the purposes of this video, shot refers\nto spherical projectiles fired two or more at a time from a firearm. Shot size is either\nthe nominal diameter of the pellets, or the standardized name representing that diameter.\nNon-spherical shot exists, but I\u2019ve never come across a standard size system for those\nprojectiles, and they only show up in a handful of novelty or specialty shotshells anyway.\nShot can be made from a variety of materials, but I won\u2019t get into that much in this video\nbecause standard shot sizes are the same for all materials. Despite some misleading charts,\nthere aren\u2019t separate size systems for lead and steel shot.\nAs used in firearms, shot can be separated into two major varieties: smaller birdshot,\nand larger buckshot. Both are round pellets fired manifoldly, but they can be distinguished\nby their size, the way they\u2019re loaded, their ballistic properties, and how they\u2019re used.\nThe next video will cover buckshot; this video will focus on birdshot.\nBirdshot is very much the characteristic shotgun payload. Dozens, hundreds, even thousands\nof birdshot pellets are fired simultaneously, and spread out in flight to create a wide\ncloud - called a pattern - that improves the shooter\u2019s chances of hitting small, fast-moving,\nand/or distant targets. The idea is that with the right pattern; a\ntarget anywhere inside will be hit by enough pellets to get the job done.\nThis is the kind of behavior most folks associate with shotguns - sometimes incorrectly so,\nbut more on that in the next video. As the name suggests, birdshot is used on\nall types of birds, along with other small game animals, pests, and varmints; and inanimate\nobjects like the breakable clay discs used in various shooting activities.\nBecause birdshot pellets are relatively small and used in large numbers, the amount of birdshot\nin a shell is typically described by the total weight or mass of shot, usually in ounces\nor grams. When it\u2019s loaded, the shot is measured out by weight or an equivalent volume,\nnot by a specific number of pellets. Ammo manufacturers may give pellet counts\nin addition to the weight of shot, but these numbers are almost always estimates.\nStandard American birdshot ranges from the size of a grain of sand to just below the\nsmallest buckshot in steps of one hundredth of an inch. There are also accepted half-sizes\nthat cut that step to just five thousandths of an inch.\nThat\u2019s less than the thickness of one of my beard hairs.\nAll these birdshot sizes are split between two major naming systems. The smaller sizes\nuse a system of numbers, while larger sizes are designated by letters. We\u2019ll run through\nthe sizes, starting at the bottom with the numbered birdshot.\nThe way these numbers work, the lower the number, the larger the pellet. It\u2019s a little\ncounterintuitive, but there\u2019s a handy mathematical formula that relates these numbers to their\ncorresponding pellet diameter. Simply take the shot size number, subtract\nit from seventeen, and the difference is the nominal pellet diameter in hundredths of an\ninch. Take #5 birdshot as an example. 17 minus 5\nis 12. Move the decimal point two places to the left, and #5 birdshot pellets are .12\ninches in diameter. This formula also holds true for non-integer\nnumbers, allowing for half sizes such as 7\u00bd. 17 minus 7.5 is 9.5, or .095 inches. The numbered birdshot sizes start at #12, which is .05 inches in diameter, followed\nby #11, and #10. Anything smaller than #12 is simply called \u201cdust shot\u201d, though sometimes\n#11 and #12 are also referred to as dust shot. Because of their very low mass, tiny #10,\n11, and 12 pellets are only effective on small animals at very close ranges. For that reason,\nthese sizes are used primarily for pest control, and are often called rat-shot or snake-shot.\nYou won\u2019t see many actual shotgun shells factory-loaded with this tiny shot nowadays;\nbut it does show up in specialty shotshells and pistol cartridges, and the shot by itself\ncan be obtained for handloading. Moving up the scale, we have #9, 8, and 7\nshot. Unlike minuscule #10 and smaller sizes, this\nshot is heavy enough to remain effective beyond absolute point-blank ranges, but still provides\nvery high pellet counts and large, dense patterns that are ideal for fragile, but small or fast-moving\ntargets such as clays or small game animals. Also in this range are #7 \u00bd and #8 \u00bd birdshot.\nThese are the only common half-sizes in the American system, though others can be defined.\nWhen dealing with pellets this small, half-sizes offer relatively significant changes in pellet\ncount, and with the way these sizes are made and used, it makes sense to have these intermediaries.\nSince #9 through #7 lead birdshot is less expensive to manufacture than most larger\nsizes, they\u2019re what you\u2019ll usually find in cheap, steel-based, bulk-pack shotshells\nthat are great for inexpensive plinking and training.\nNext, #6, #5, and #4 birdshot are popular for hunting most upland game, as well as smaller\nor close-range waterfowl. .125\u201d #4 \u00bd shot isn\u2019t unheard of. Some\nreloading suppliers offer slightly oversized #4 shot that\u2019s technically #4 \u00bd. And since\nthat\u2019s exactly one-eighth of an inch, metal balls from various other sources can be repurposed\nas shot. But if you see shotgun ammunition specifically\nmarked as #4 \u00bd birdshot - or 5 \u00bd, or 6 \u00bd - you\u2019re more likely dealing with a different\nshot size system. British birdshot sizes include #4 \u00bd, but that\u2019s similar to American #6.\nAbove #4 is #3, #2, and #1 birdshot. These bigger pellets are used primarily on waterfowl;\noffering the penetration and energy retention needed for big, tough birds like geese, or\nlong-range shots at high-flying game. At .16 inches in diameter, #1 shot tops off\nthe numbered birdshot sizes. Larger sizes still move up in hundredth-inch increments,\nbut the math is replaced by a new system of letters and tuples.\nThe sizes just above #1 are the \u201cB\u201ds. At .17 inches \u2013 what would have been #0\nby the number-size formula - is B shot. After that, we have BB shot at .18 inches, and triple-B\nat .19 inches. If that middle one rings a bell, yes, .18-caliber\nBB birdshot was the original basis for the name and bore size of BB air guns. However,\nair rifles have evolved some since their introduction, and the standard pellet size for modern BB\nguns is 4.5 mm, or .177-caliber. Also, it\u2019s worth mentioning that \u201cBB\u201d\nis often used as a catch-all term for shotgun pellets. If someone uses \"BB\" as a plural\nnoun, as in \u201cI like magnum shells because they hold more BBs\u201d, they probably just\nmean pellets in general, not necessarily BB-size pellets.\nAnyway, above triple-B, there\u2019s no quadruple-B. Instead, things start over with a new letter,\nand we have .20-caliber T shot and .21-caliber TT shot. Then, the letter changes once more\nto give us .22-caliber F shot \u2013 sometimes called triple-T \u2013 and .23-caliber FF shot.\nThe \u201cB\u2019s\u201d and \u201cT\u2019s\u201d are common steel shot sizes for waterfowl hunting in\nareas where lead has been banned. Since steel shot has a relatively low density, achieving\nthe same penetration and effective range requires larger pellets.\nThe biggest \u201cT\u201d and \u201cF\u201d birdshot sizes are also used on thin-skinned varmints and\npredators like coyotes and wild cats. Compared to buckshot, these sizes offer higher pellet\ncounts at the expense of some range and penetration. There\u2019s no handy formula for these letter\nbirdshot sizes, but they\u2019re not too tough to keep track of. Just remember that \u201cB\u201d\nshot is essentially #0 at .17-caliber, then the other two \u201cB\u201ds, the \u201cT\u201ds, and\nthe \u201cF\u201ds follow in the usual hundredth-inch increments.\nThe \u201cF\u201d sizes top off the American birdshot system. One hundredth of an inch above FF\nis the smallest buckshot size, .24-caliber #4 buck. We\u2019ll start there next time.\nAll in all, American birdshot isn\u2019t too difficult to grasp and remember once you see\nhow the system works. Stay tuned for part 2 on buckshot, where things get somewhat less\nstraightforward. For now, I welcome any questions and comments,\nand please let me know if there are any general shotgun topics you\u2019d like me to explain.\nI\u2019ve been planning this new video series for a while, and now that it\u2019s finally off\nthe ground, I\u2019m looking forward to feedback. Until next time, have fun and shoot safe.", "nzXEWAhLJao": "[Music] hi this is kat with beadaholique.com thing blank and waxed cotton cord now this is a very simple project and this is something that

so I'll show you how to do that stuff as well but to complete this project here's what you'll need you'll need your stamping donut ring right here and then I have to crimp ends with loops two four millimeters 20 gauge jump rings I have my magnetic clasp and my 1 millimeter cotton cord and then you'll need whichever empress' art stampings that you want to use today I'm going to be using that little 3 millimeter heart if you want you could also use various letters or various other shapes you just want to make sure that whatever stamping you're using fits in the size of the doughnut stamping blank that you have I have my impress art hammer my bench block with my steel plate and my rubber backing and then for other tools we're just going to be using a pair of chain nose pliers a pair of crimping pliers a pair of scissors a ruler and you're also going to need a paper towel for this as well so that is all the supplies so let's go ahead and get started so I want to start by doing our stamping first so I'm going to take my little blank here and when you have a blank depending on the shape and size you might notice that there's a side that has a little lip and a side that is a little bit smoother I tend to think of the side that is a little bit smoother as the front however some people sort of you know choose whichever side they like but I'm going to use that from this side as my friend I'm going to go ahead and place that onto my table and you can tell by looking at the end which side you're going to want your little heart on so usually the empress' art stamping here is going to be facing you but just always double-check the direction of your particular stamping so very simply what we're going to do is I'm going to place my little heart right where I want it take my hammer and give it one good whack and there's my little heart that mine wasn't quite as centered as I wanted it to be but I think it will look just fine so I'm happy with that so I'm going to set my tools aside and now before I fill it in I'm going to set it down on to a little paper towel here I'm actually going to take my little paper towel here and just kind of rip it in half let's go ahead and set that down and now I'm going to take my impress art stamp enamel and just remove the cap very carefully and now all you're going to do is use that tip and just sort of fill it in you can see that it comes out like a really thick little ink and all you want to do is just cover your stamping there and let it sit for about 10 seconds or so and I you're going to take the other half of your paper towel and just wipe it clean and now to take a clean part of the towel and just make sure that you've gotten it off here we go so now our stamping shows up and it's nice and bright and shiny so we are ready to move on to the next step so now take your ruler and you're going to take your cotton cord and for as long as you want your necklace go ahead and measure that length I'm going to do about a 16 inch necklace so I'm going to get 16 inches of my cord here take my scissors and just snip that off now you can set your ruler and your cord aside so I have my length of about 16 inches here now what you're going to want to do is match up those two ends string that down and now we're going to tie a larks head knot over our little donut here so what you're going to do is you're going to take your donut and place it on to the little loop just like so and now pull that loop through pull your two ends through and I you're just going to pull down and you're going to get that little larks head knot so this is one way to do it if you want your front side to look like this you'll just simply reverse it so I'm going to show you how to do that really quick it's very much the same technique just with your donut facing the opposite direction so it's just a preference on look as to how you want it to come out in the end so again just loop it through and pull it down and now my friend I like it this way it looks just really nice and clean so now all you're going to do is separate your two sides here and you're going to take one of your crimpers and just slide it on to that one millimeter chord there and now take your crimping plier and simply set it in there and that's very first notch make sure your crimpers are facing the right way we're going to set it into that first match and make sure that court is pushed nice and far back you're not going to push it through that end so make sure it's really nice and tight so you make your first crimp and now you have your little feet cut so now you're going to move it to the second match there twist it and crimp it one more time to give it a nice strong attachment and now we're just going to simply repeat that with the other side so I'll show you really quickly string on your crimp make sure it's nice and tight in there and make sure it doesn't fall off there we go nice and tight I think my fingers are sticky let's see from the ink all right so now just slide it in there and again just go ahead and crimp lift it out turn it and crimp one more time and you're all set there so now the last part of this is going to take our team has pliers and our jump ring here and the zero on four and one crimping pliers also work as chain nose pliers so I'm going to use those to help open my jump ring slide that on to one of the loops and slide on one side of my magnetic clasp and it will nicely attached to my pliers they're simply close up that jump ring and now we're going to repeat on the other side open up that jump ring slide it on to your loop and slide on the other side of the clasp there we go close that up and remove your pliers from baby eidetic class and you're all done that's how quick and simple and easy this little project is if you want to get really fun and do some more stampings I definitely where is that instead of the empress' art stampin ammo you can also use vintaj patinas if you want to add a little bit of color there so a lot of fun things you can do with this technique you can add two strands and create a little bracelet that's really nice and fun I hope you enjoyed this video you can get all of these supplies and find more videos at beadaholique.com", "Rq3EZNfVNjE": "[Music] talk to anyone in the UK name a Northern River they're probably going to say the trend and from a fishing point of view match fishing specimen fishing barbell carb he's got the lot this particular stretch here at talks he's actually where I grew up fishing a male that way mean and grounded at a caravan from being a little toddler little ginger kid squeaky voice I were down here for six weeks holiday every single year I still love it as much as I did then tidal rivers sort of sum up what fishing is from being a little tiny kid it's wild there's a massive amount of unknown like the trend was into the river Humber what goes into the sea so you never know when you get a buy what you're gonna catch you come along this bang it's not clean you're paddling about in more these big rocks and boulders everything about is wild aggressive and just pure fishing bain't choice is a massive part a tackling any natural war oh really and I think the reason for that is because there's so much variety here and unless you cover your options with plenty of different bases for plenty of different species you quite limited I mean if you were coming specimen fishing for Bible a few pallets a bit of fish meal groundbait that's fine but from my match fishing background to get the most out of a peg you've got to have plenty of bait you've got to have a good selection of different baits and you've got to be prepared to change between them and adapt during your session one of the most common questions I get asked is what groundbait mix you use when you're fishing rivers like this and although there's no hard and fast rules something I like to do is consider what kind of anglers fish the venue or that particular stretch and I know on this little bit of talk sir here it gets fished heavily by the specimen boy so barble anglers carp anglers but more importantly people who are putting a lot of pellets and fish meal in the river so the fish I'm targeting the roach skimmers hybrids bream are used to eat in fish meal baits on my ground Bay needs that bit of fish meal in if I'm going to catch them fish so I've gone for a 50/50 mix for a day of mainline match sweet marine very rich in fish meal really good quality pellets crushed up bit like the stuff that the barbel boys are feeding is breaking down on the bottom and then will the fishery in powerful ground bay catches all species that's the fish meal element and my mix the other part of it traditional cereal mix Proactive from mainland match it's got a lot of corn maize hand crushed up fresh ingredients and on big wild natural venues that high food content cereal nature of a mix is really important so I've got the fish meal element 50% of its sweet marine and I've got that sweet quality seed Hampi base which is the proactive so next thing is how the groundbait is actually mixed which is very important because I'm going to be putting a lot of damp wet particles into the mix and for that and I've mixed the groundbait on the dry side I used to be a stickler for over wetting it me it didn't come at me feeder pro kleh and when you're cramming a lot of hand casters chopped worms damn it base into your feeder if you mix it too wet to start with it won't come out which is really important you want that feeder to get to the bottom an empty pretty quick so then fish can come in so I always do mine before I actually get to the bank on the morning give it a little splash of water so all them cereals fish meals in that quality groundbait can be soaking it up and then when I get to the bank I have a little check maybe add a little bit mark to it and nice and dry is absolutely key you can always make it a little bit wetter but you can spoil it by putting too much water in too soon that leads us into what baits we're going to actually put into the feeder when we're fishing a river like this first of all Castor's and hemp to really important river bass hemp seeds quite a heavy bait so it stays on the bottom in that fast flow keeps fish grubbing about drops between rocks just holds fishing your peg for a long period and Castor's all fish love them great bait for big I bridge route skimmers even fish like b\u00e4rbel when you're catching them in the daytime love crunchy fresh casters so a couple of packs of casters a couple of packs RM that's my main feed that I'm gonna be putting through my feed however the other bait that is absolutely vital and reverse are these bad boys and Raveena's worms which of course we're going to chop up to release all that goodness you can play around with how fine or how coarse you chop them but really important thing to think about worms is when you actually put them in your feet or so hopefully I'll be able to give you a few tips when they're on the box about this but having some worms with you to either introduce halfway through a session introduce when some bigger fish are kicking about or if you're not catching anything putting worms in all of a sudden can completely change your pack the important thing you've got them with you so if casters and hamp aren't working properly you've got the dangerous another string to your bow a couple of other little things that I like to do on places like this to get a bit of an edge I've took a few casters out of the tub when I first got here this morning and just leave them dry while the ones I'm feeding are in war a second and fuller leave them in a little tub these are just for the hawk you'll find the bigger fish in FLIR war I tend to lack a very slow falling Bay and if you leave some casters out of war it'll dry out dark enough and more importantly go neutrally buoyant or even float so when you've put a hook in and they're gonna sink that little bit slower and your trick or nod bonus fish something I love doing don't it since our a kid here on the trend and it's amazing how often you'll be catching little fish slip a couple of darker floating casters on nail a big and straight away or the baits I've got we make corn a great changer up Bay only costs a few pans for it in a corn had never come on the trend with our way the final bait I've got with me maggots obviously number one up bait for me and if you are struggling a little bit like worms starting to introduce maggots later in the day can bring fishing I think the reason for it is is because small fish the fish have just spoke about not liking corn love maggots and if it's a hard day you're not getting many bags putting maggots in will get them smaller fish into your swim which of course creates competition if the little fish are there very in a way it won't take bigger fish long to come along they want to join in on that pie they want a bit of the buffet so introducing maggots on a hard day deadly rivers are the ultimate place to learn and apply war a craft because then fish could be living anywhere in that channel what is it 70 meters why today you don't really know where they're gonna be so you have to really think about it and know that it comes around a big vendee or in the deep water and all the flows on the inside so I'm pretty confident that's where they will be laying but if you've got five or six pegs further down that channel goes a lot further out into the river and you've got a fish then pegs down there different to how you'd fish these the nice thing about it is if you pleasure fishing you can sit in different parts to suit what you'd like to do but in a match fishing situation you've given a peg and it's a challenge to work out where to fish whether your pleasure fishing match fishing or specimen fish in that war a crafts aspect ticking away in your mind and I love that working out aware them wild fish are gonna be on a big river like this one thing that can be very daunting is deciding where to actually cast them fish for the day but nice simple way of doing it I like to get my rod that I've got made up we braid on clip a two-ounce distance led on it nice heavy LED and just have a cast a bar and feel your way around you swimming the area that I'm hoping to fish today is as the river slopes off and starts to flatten out towards that main deep channel and river bed that's the bit that I think them fish are gonna be holding up in there's a nice bit of flow not too fast out in the middle got a conveyor belt of food coming down all the time but knowing this particular stretch of river I know it comes around this Big Bend area and the flow is bored out this inside up to about 30 meters out poor rivers change so I'm gonna have a little plum up just to find out and it's nice to be able to see exactly what's out there on the bottom so I'll plop him saw a 15 meters out to start with no probably about ten foot deep there that 2 ounce LED took about four seconds to it the barn and just give it a nice smooth pull back and you'll find any snags and stuff like seems quite smooth there hopefully if I go a bit further it'll keep sloping away now until a fine that main river channel a little bit further probably 18 20 meters ow see you know that took a little bit longer to hit the bottom nice smooth clear bottom there now if I catch this a little bit further and feel like it's the same gap that's a nice starting point I don't like to be too strict or Fafi with it because it's a river you got to be willing to change and stuff but see it's about the same there so that's for me I feel like I found that main riverbed now it's very very smooth don't feel that there is any snags there and as a starting point I'm asking with that I'm gonna clip this rod up about that distance one last check these clear [Music] obviously I've got my other rod ready with mono one the reason I use braid to pull up with these question can you feel that bomb down a little bit that I feel any snags and bumps on the bottom but to get this rod and my mono rod the same distance out when I'm both down the same ol exactly I'm gonna use my distance sticks stick them both up at the same distance that this one is nice and accurate ready to rock and roller see what happens the start of a session on any natural venue always gives me a little buzz because you never ever know what is going to happen when it comes to actually starting your session one bit of advice I would give out is always err on the side of bigger fish heavier gear which means starting on your mono rod for me because the last thing you'd want to do even if you were pleasure fishing or in a match is hook a big fish on your first few casts and lose it you can always change to your braid but if there's a lot of small fish there but I'm starting on a size 10 L wgf hook actually use the pre-tied ones because I can't tie them back myself one meet along got Glenn - oh 79 gauge so nice balance gear that if I look big fish I can get out no problem all and I'm gonna kick off with my favorite three red maggots on there and I'm gonna load me feeder with do casters and a little bit of ham not too much plug lightly with that dry groundbait and see what happens this is the exciting bit you never know what you gonna get first Chuck in about that little rough plug around and we think it's pretty clean out there tides just turn nice and so we're fishing on what we like to call a runoff tide so now it should be flowing from left to right all day look at this chart see what I mean I don't even put my rod on the rafts they're not a big fish but just shows doing it middle of nowhere and this fish you're already know what it is my brick silver bream a lot of these entitled from lovely fish what a star there you go talked about being positive and using strong gear size Tanakh oh 17 line first your kid it's looking like it's gonna be an hour session [Music] I can't really change anything after nailing one first Chuck so another three red and maggots one thing I would say when it comes to catching a fish on rivers I always like to hook my maggots through the thin end it's just a little personal thing but I feel like you want maximum hook point showing because she relying on fish working themselves against your rig and you rod the Maho point you've got showing the better it is so a big hawk with the maggots up through the thin and leaves the maximum amount showing Castor's attempt again a little pinch of E it's obviously some fish out there already and I'm hoping that it'll be a case today if there is a lot of fish feeding a work you know how to catch the biggest ones no this premiere schemers and an awful lot of them I breathe what picked a nice marker on that far bank a tree I've got my line clip on so you can build your peg now start a recession regular casting picked my marker to cast to and one thing I want to talk about early on is this little bit paying that boa so that feed is at the bottom but I'm holding the rod to my left on side and just without moving that feeder keeping a semi tight line all the way down until I put my rod on the rest so that little bit of movement from my left-hand side as far as I could when the feeder landed on the bottom right round so this right on the side with my rod pointing downstream has created a bow in my line and what that does is allow your feed it's a whole bottom a lot better if you fished with a super tight line that feeder dislodge easily and you'd probably have to use a very heavy feeder but I've started on a three ounce er and this rivers trapping through quite fast at the minute but that feed is at the bottom and not move position yet which is fantastic nicely balanced it's just holding bottom that tips Ben I've got the bow in my line my rod pointing slightly downstream so everything's arcing round into that bow and on to my feeder means that when a fish picks it up you'll get a quick bang hopefully and the tip will come flying back that's the best bit for me all of it the by always brings back memories of coming on here as a kid when I used to fish a feeder every time it moved downstream in the flow your tip does move a bit but it's a completely different indication to when this official-like look about as a fish it's almost like becomes an instinct when it's a fish it bangs and rattles and you can tell this is something alive on the end but when it's just the feeder move and it's more of a steady little movement and getting used to them indications and working out what is a proper buy and what is an actual fish is really important cause you don't want to be winding in and moving your feeder all the time if he's not a fish on the end so you are on this session looks like we're gonna catch it for you in there well know what I buy is look at last a big eye bridge or silver burry whatever you want to call them soon build a big way or for them in a match look at an absolutely pristine fish look at that is it their maggots that art is blown them off the Orkin up the line that's a sign that these a lot of fish there and they feed in aggressive so all these little signs and fish like that so early on a telling me I can be nice and positive so I'm gonna keep piling the amp and castering hopefully keep catching these bad boys now some people might ask would you ever not clip up on a river and for me it's a really good question because yeah there are times when are definitely wooden and might turn out that later in today's session I don't want to clip off but the most important time to cast accurate and to make sure you clips up accurately on both rods is it a look laughs straight away is it the start of a session like this because you're trying to get them fish into a tie area and already you could see it's working and bikes are getting faster and faster but if it did go tricky and then fish slowed up a little bit taking your line clip off is a really good way of keeping them coming because they might just back off that line move a little bit further downstream a bit past where you're fishing so be prepared to take that clip off but at the start keep it flip shop nice and accurate another nice little pom a could I borrow silver [Music] I've been really lucky because I've fished all over the world on some really testing venues big rivers in Croatia massive lakes in Italy first big guard fighting fish but in all honesty nowhere has ever put as much strain and stress on my fishing equipment than the tidal river trend it froze everything out yeah big boulders muddy war a hard fighting fish who cashed in big feeders and every part you set off from your reel that's cranking them feeders in your main line you braved and nots have got to be strong your feeders have got to be bulletproof each little aspect has gotta be super strong durable and sell perfectly to get the best from this kind of venue [Music] on the tackle and rig side of big rivers like this I have a couple of different setups but importantly there's a reason for every little intricate thing that I do so kicking off what I like to class as my smaller fish outfit now not because I'm only gonna catch tiny fish on it but I'm hoping to catch everything from little Roach and ace right up to skimmers bream maybe even a Bible today so one of the outfits is geared towards the smaller side of that the other one towards the bigger fish so event a 13-4 a distance feeder rod for the smaller fish it's quite a powerful piece of kit still loads a backbone in the bottom end of the rod it's softer towards the middle and an ash tippy action so I can see them bites from smaller fish very clearly a lot of power to cast and hold big feeders up to four rounds not a problem however when you see in action you'll notice it's got that softness a progressive through action so you don't bump them smaller fish off partner in the rod I've got a nice powerful big reel when you're cranking in a large feed or even if I'm fishing clothing need that power for me it's a dialer cast ISM 25 QD I never let me down yet last four years loads of power the reels loaded with Oh ten pulsate braid main line and there's two reasons for this for me first of all by detection when you target in the smaller fish which is what this outfit is designed for I like to see them little indications bites that you get as your feed is just settled often I'll even hold my rod when I'm fishing for them smaller fish follow that bow a line down it's amazing how many Roach and a she catch as you're actually paying out your bow and I'm telling you now without braid you will not see them indications secondly for holding bottom in fast flow braids the one you can use a much lighter feeder because there's less resistance is that bows paid out which means you hit a lot more bites from small fish because you can get away we're using a slightly lighter feeder to the end of the braid I've got a 10-pound shield shock leader which might sound heavy for small fish but think about it you're using feeders up to four ounce in weight these loads of rocks loads of bits of wood and stuff floating down that bottom end you rig get some absolute hammer and the beauty a 10 pound shockers you don't get a tangle with them onto the important terminal end of the rig for me there's one thing that's really important on rivers and that's that it doesn't tangle at all and this rig I haven't had a problem with kicks off with a super tight line stop slid up the mainline followed by a really durable snap links River below that another super tight line stop and finished off with a little twisted loop about five inches long with a little hook line flew in the end of it hook lens and hooks I don't want to go too much in depth during the rig chat because it's something that I changed quite a lot while I'm fishing so back up here however there's a few little tricks I really want to show you the reason for two super tight line stops you might ask well first of all I can slide the first one well apart of the way so I've got a completely free running rig which is how I will fish for most of the time like that bit of freerunning movement if a fish ever gets snagged it can pull the line through and not going to break your upland however when you catch in small fish on rivers a bolt rig or fixed feeder can be very good and the beauty about this cell is that you can slide the second line stop down tighter to the feeder and have it literally fixed like so so if you're missing bikes and having problems you can alter the rig in a matter of seconds by sliding that line stop down so your feeder straps if you want a freerunning rig which I prefer for bigger fish slide it up out of the way and that feeder can slide no problems tangle free super simple we've not a lot of stuff on your line you can fish it fixed and you can have it free running so you might ask now why not use this braid lighter style for everything the reason being if you hook in big fish like barble bream even bigger skimmers it's nice to have a little bit more gives a little bit more length in your rod to cushion them bigger fish the last thing you want to do is hook a barb alambre Smith on it you can get them out but it's not comfortable playing them especially in a match so on to my bigger fish cell the main difference between the two setups is that this one features a mono mainline rather than the braid I've got a simple 8 pound pulse Pro which is a durable super strong absolutely bulletproof main line that's still quite thin diameter so it does cut through the flow nicely or it's got a little bit of giving a little bit of stretch compared to braid so when you do what bigger fish on it you're a lot more comfortable playing it the terminal side of things is exactly the same the same rig so I can tighten it up and lock it off have it free running if I want what on the rod from I've gone for a 14-foot version an extra foot inland so I can keep that line a little bit higher if I do what bigger fish they're a little bit further out from me less likely to snag me in near side Bank side vegetation and rocks and stuff all round little bit more control little bit more forgiving that's the big fish cell with me today I've got four different tips from an ounce and a half carbon right up to five ounce that should cater for any big river fishing to be honest for me today I've sell for the 3 ounce carbon you'll see nicely balanced keels over love Lac and see plenty of ice on it well I've been plenty with you to play around with during the day if you need to is really important that's my tip for the day okay got it fit [Music] feed a choice something that's absolutely essential to get right that can have a big influence on what you actually catch and for me on big tidal powerful fast flowing rivers like the trend the why the seven different places throughout Europe the gripper feeder is the one it's designed just for it tested on venues just like this two different sizes medium and large which both come into play again I can't tell you when to put a big one or a small one on because that changes throughout the session so we'll see when we're on the box and see putting a bit Mar Bay in get a bigger one on feel that there's a bit too much bay switch back to the medium one so changing between the sizes throughout a session is very important another reason why I select this particular feeder is durability you're never gonna get anywhere more testing them venues like this the batter in your feed a big rocks on the bottom loads of snags and stuff you need it to be solid as a rock there's nothing worse than dropping off from your lead coming off a little bit of power going above it snapping these are designed for this rugged environment this kind of venue another nice thing I like about these feeders is the fact that your bait releases from them very well I've already mentioned don't like coming back with bait stuck in it baits look in the feeder the whole idea of thinking in depth about what you put in them is because it can be released for the fish to come in and eat to get them in your peg and catch them so the smooth internals of these feeders combined with the cage just to grip that bit of bay in means it comes out very fast and effectively once they're in your swim another nice thing lovely low profile I've mentioned the design for this kind of venue you can see they've got a big surface area there to grip on the bottom I've fished the trend on this particular stretch when its add six or seven for extra water in a marine through loads of people using different feeders have problems with them bouncing round at the swim so they're not fishing effectively these hold a lot easier and more firmly for the size than any other feed that I've used and that's thanks to this big surface area and the nice little grips on the bottom lots of little things into one tiny product that probably the most important terminal item on your rig over the years I've had some absolute nightmare days on venues like this that really test you to the limit sometimes you get a peg that's full of snags you're gonna lose some gear and it's taught me to step it up a notch on venues like this if you think you should use an eight pound shop for you to use a 10 pound one if you think you should have a size 12 on stick a size 10 up you've just gotta go that extra bit more aggression wise to get the best out of places like this hey-up firstly the perch nothing this water level dropping which is something you can't do a lot about and you've got a deal with on tidal rivers it's time to have a little move bit further down there and out fillet catch bigger one or two I get my feet wet here some people lights actually stand up and fish on tidal rivers like behind the seat box or on a platform we are Rob dress so that they can move a bit easier for me I like my seat box and side train to be nice and comfortable so spending five or ten minutes moving isn't a problem and now that water levels dropped I think it's time to try and catch a few bigger ones there's a couple of different ways I like to go about it but the main one is to mix it up in terms of what you're putting in your feeder and the two baits for me that seem to pick out bigger fish consistently on natural venues are worms and also corn so my first fly is to start putting some chopped worms and corn through my feed and not like I'm gonna start putting instead of hanpan casters I'm gonna start putting a blob of chopped worms not too finely chopped and four or five grain decor just to see if it will pull in some bigger fish that worm smells quite a lot quite a smelly bait shop where so it might pull some bigger fish upstream and the good thing about Cornish little fish like the my Briggs and Roach and Dyson stuff they leave it alone you've always got a bit of a builder perfect bigger particles on the bottom it might take three or four casts to get some bigger fish there oh I hope it does at water levels really drop now and you might also ask if you have actually moved a little bit closer to the water like we have here would you unclip and try and fish down the same ol that you wasn't for me I actually like a little rattle straightaway there well beyond doing of a small fish to start way I actually like to leave my clip on my reel because as that water level drops the depth out there is obviously getting lower and lower and I feel what a bigger fish in particular will back off into the main channel of the river with that water level dropping so leave my clip in the same place to start we have moved maybe a metre and a half two meters forward so I'm actually fishing a little bit further out now but it all makes sense to me and I can always come back in on that little bit about if I want to but in my experience I found it's nice to follow out the tide so to speak I've also changed and I ruin it on the up now I'm putting some worms through nice bit of cord and as I've said out for life after a short space of time of putting these different baits through the feed we might nail a bigger fish or so and if not don't seem to hurt them small fish you're to put off anyway and keep him busy all time it's not a negative way of fishing it's a massive River look at size over loads of feeding fish here and you don't get any prizes by be negative on places like there's plenty of a decent size feeder you can do is always get your bait ready for the next cast because you're in and out quite a lot as you can see I've got my next blob of worms there few bits of corn in with it I'll play another small fish seems like you still wear them little ones it's only the second cast putting them all the babes through for catching these sides fishing braid rather than one out you do see indications a lot more clearly and seem to hook a few my fish would grade when they last saw shy but not after them maybe bigger brush there's a big a bit of worm on when I read and I get this time again just constantly trying to hook a bigger fish got worms in corning piece of worm on the orc now every cast you can see I'm building up to making something a little bit different happen which is what you've got to do in situations like [Music] tell you what just seemed to have brought some better ibrehem if anything just been my positively bigger bait smacking the swim just better and better and better be absolutely over the moon if this were a composition because the queuing up now got that probably the biggest eye bridge yet welcome to that corn worms looking best part or a pound probably lovely fish keep it going lintel your bream and skimmer might want some ham as well definitely some better fish coming in just takes a bit of time to get them worms and corn going in pull them bigger fish upstream sometimes gotta have a little bit of patience with other mice this is a proper skimmer or not definitely a bigger one now whatever it is there we are that's what we want it mr. schema bream haha these are like chunks are muscle in the EU now a patient's putting in some bigger baits and stuff and we've nailed a bigger one hopefully there's a few mark there what we're after tell you I even surprised me plowing them all the bigger mop Oz ative Beijing just made it better in general it's absolutely solid now [Music] got a piece of corn on the orc now just in a bid to catch a more and more bigger fish [Music] well cut them by its are they good you sure you have even though my bridge proper Fang that chip down you get a big drop back you might not believe me now but I've actually got got that double core got many there ran a pic out and bigger fish that's a big bun prove them fish your own we donate two pieces of sweet corn on a straw chat Wow quite a lot of these smaller fish there now and I feel like well I'm at fishing brain saying to me our fishing with my braid rod applying a few of a little trick you probably catch them quicker son we have a little go and just see if I can up that capture a a little bit more I think smaller up baits just one or two maggots even on that great big ox really good for catching smaller fish because you leave so much hook coin showing for him to open themselves another thing I'm gonna put a few less particles in the feeder just so the fish out there will hopefully pick up the update a little bit faster but the important thing I really want to show you something that Alan Henry brilliant feeder angler on the trend wind loads of matches showed me some years ago cast out flowing from left to right so as that feeder lands on the water get you out as far upstream left as you can dink you see it you see it at the bottom then keep that tight line all the way around little clocks and stuff done there we go on this one arm just shows you can catch these little fish without even putting your rod onto your rash it's a great way of catching up really quickly and doing the I'll and enrich tail blower in fantastic see I'm not moving the feeder or just keeping that steady little it's hard line you do get to your wraps and again works an absolute treat for these small fish I'm not even getting it on to the rest of the minute look at look at that not catching much quicker on a tidal River than that feeders literally in the bottom now getting a bite so important to hold that rod really catch a big weight very quick if it's green light didn't see that one coming bigger fish on the braid rot it nice there when you feel them from their heads like that that's a really big fish feels big man earlier on a mentioned about getting them smaller fish feeding in your peg often brings in the bat efficient you literally cannot get a better example of that we're showing you the braid rod fishing fast for smaller fish caught 15 or 20 and then whatever this is has come along and muscled in on the action very large proposition you won't need many chips we'll look at that yeah Wow well I said that I liked the unknown about venues like this sack they are fishing for them small fish catching a couple of red maggots a list brew muscled in on the action you know what you cameraman think that I'm coming over you you've got another thing coming so I'm stopping in for a few hours cheers mr. Brue [Music] I have to do any sort of pleasure 15 it's always touching barbell or big fish on a river because you sat there early morning your rods up in the air you poured yourself a coffee everything's calm and collected but the second that fish takes your Bay all hell breaks lose the bye it's absolutely epic [Music] when you're trying to target an R big fish you want to be very very selective you only fishing for one or two bites in a session so all the bait is tailored towards that so starting off with groundbait compared to the sweet less oily baits we're using match fishing when I'm targeting a bar well I've got pure ground halibut palates and there's even a few two mills mixed in there for good gesture absolutely stinks to high heaven which is very very important because b\u00e4rbel and big fishing rivers will come upstream on the scent of that ground bay and obviously find your hook bait with a little bear look I also always bring some 8 mil high Oriole halibut pellets which you can loose feed upstream make a nice little bit of noise you've got to use that pulling power and smell of the groundbait the noise and the falling of the pellets through the water to get them there in the first place and then there's the hook baits and for me there's two different combos the first one really simple 2 8 mil drilled halibut pellets not a lot of people use a bait that small for b\u00e4rbel and I find that the bigger whereare ones often pick it out but these times I'm rivers like this when you get pestered by fish like bream and skimmers on small hook baits and that is when the big bad boys come into play these are for email link dumbbells the stink as they are but to give them a little bit more spice I've added some squid goo to him little trick that we all may Ally showed me I have a little sniff for them oh absolutely disgusting but when there's a big fish in you swim its gonna sniff that out quicker than anything fishing than that [Music] dear wise-4 barbel and bigger fish on rivers for them pleasure sessions a keep it simple a little bit like the match fishing self but on steroids stepped up a notch the same rod a 13 foot a ventus distance feeder I've gone for a three-ounce tip today but if it were hammering through and I got really big feeders on stepping up to a 5 ounce and that's matched the same cast ISM real but this time loaded with ten pounds rag line absolute bulletproof stuff at the terminal end of the rig everything is really simplified because the thing about catching b\u00e4rbel and bigger fish is that you haven't got to worry about I'm hooking themselves against your feeder the bites are so aggressive they'll pull your tip that often lifting the butt of your rod up its best bit of it for me so I've gone for a little micro LED clip setup that's free running which is very important because if this feeder gets stuck in a rock while I've got a fish on it can pull that swivel out of the clip and still pull my rod and often dislodge itself from a snack so a freerunning rig with a national microlight clip really really important and if the feeder gets really jammed it can often pop off the clip as well now the hook length another very important thing something I've learned over the years about barbell on rivers especially when targeting them in the daytime is that the back half away from the feed are quite often you've got all that smelly groundbait in there but you want you hook bait two to four feet below it so I'll often staff with around three feet of Oh 25 pure fluorocarbon very heavy quality fluorocarbon that lays nice and still on the bottom and is almost invisible in water down to a size 10 M wgb hook not too big a rope but nice and strong so then where a fish succubae up we got a problem loads of strength to get a mat and that's got a nice hair Egon there you'll notice it's not too tight and there's a reason for that and that's because when there's a lot of fish like skimmers bream even chew ba-bow a longer hair will stop your hook in them smaller fish as I've mentioned this side of fishings all about being selective and picking out the big uns and that is one little way to do it as well [Music] now my lord look at that what a fish [Music] look at that what a fish if someone said to me why do you like fishing rivers and natural places like this I'd say because of the unknown however even I didn't expect this little chap to come along this morning my first ever River Trent car you don't realize how much you're a shock surprise and tree that is to me I must have been an annoying little kid because I used to come here with my dad and granddad and always asked a million questions just because I were never sure what we're out there dad is the only big barb of the year granddad would you ever cut your car Finny areas the only big pike and stuff and I remember catching the first barb look round that corner at law has been funny a little and about a pounding weight but our absolutely over the moon and I think they're summed up that mystery and inquisitiveness of river fishing because we've caught a big barb or probably five or six times the size of them ones we used to catch twenty years ago up there for we've caught a carp and I've never seen one out area before and I think that kind of mystery and never knowing what's going to happen on a river is what will make me come back here for the rest of my life you", "dMuPrRmY49s": "hey guys welcome back to my channel my name is caitlin dalbrow today we are making carrot cake with a cream cheese frosting i had actually asked you guys if you preferred this cake or a pumpkin pie recipe and i got two responses and one said pumpkin pie and one's a carrot cake so i just went with what was next on my editing system so yeah carrot cake and cream cheese frosting let's get right into this recipe okay so first we need to peel and grate up two cups of carrots this is a pretty long process so if you don't want to deal with all that i'm pretty sure you can get already shredded up carrots at the store next we're taking a large bowl and we're adding in two cups of flour two teaspoons baking powder one and a half teaspoons of baking soda one teaspoon of salt and two teaspoons of cinnamon and we're just gonna whisk all that together you're actually supposed to sift all this stuff i don't know why we didn't yeah after the dry ingredients were all mixed up we're adding in two cups of sugar one and a 4 cups of vegetable oil and 4 eggs [Music] and we're beating all that up with a hand mixer until everything is combined then quickly preheating the oven to 350 degrees and then back to that large bowl we added in two cups of shredded carrots along with one 8 ounce can of crushed pineapple drained and again mixing all that up until combined now we're going to take a 9x13 pan and we're just greasing that up with some butter then we're gonna pour that batter into the pan and cook that for about 45 minutes and once it's all done it's gonna be all sunken in in the middle and it's gonna look all sad i'm not sure why that's how this recipe has always come out i know it's most likely not supposed to be like that but it is and it's gonna come out a little dark it's surprisingly not burnt it's just dark it's weird but anyways we're gonna put that off to the side so it can completely cool and while that is cooling we can make that delicious cream cheese frosting so that calls for another large bowl one softened block of cream cheese one teaspoon of vanilla and two sticks of softened unsalted butter and we just quickly mixed that up and then gradually added in one whole pound of powdered sugar the recipe says you can add in a little bit of milk if you think it looks too thick and i was pretty sure we were gonna have to add in some milk because it was really thick in the beginning but it actually ended up being pretty freaking perfect without that milk [Music] and lastly we just had to frost that cake so we just spread that over top and since the middle is all sunken in and weird just make sure you scoop that frosting out of the hole because otherwise it's going to be the thickest layer of frosting you've ever seen i mean if you like that then keep it in the hole but if you don't make sure you spread it out and yeah it's done this is a really yummy cake i'm not a huge fan of frosting but i will eat this frosting i hope you guys enjoyed this recipe the next video will be that pumpkin pie cool whip cream cheese thing and then we're done with like family recipe stuff but there will be more food videos i'm in the process of getting my arm fixed so for those who miss the makeup tutorials those will be coming back hopefully soon within i think next month i'm thinking so yeah that's what you guys should be expecting on this channel it's still going to be a while for makeup tutorials but still more food to come but yeah thank you guys so much for watching i love you guys so much and i'll see you very soon bye", "nbywJIEYNfQ": "hi i'm joel from Jonesy's auto restoration in Ridgefield Washington and I'm going to show you how to mix automotive paint so what we have here is we have a whole assortment of different types of paint and what I'm going to try to convey to you is that different brands of paint all mix in a very similar manner and there are some tips and tricks that you need to look out for so that you mix them correctly because if you don't mix them correctly then all kinds of really bad things can happen the paint won't harden properly it won't spray properly it won't have the right viscosity to work in your gun and you can just ruin it it won't match subsequent top coats that you need to put on it so one of the most common types of paint is a base coat clear coat and this is a base coat and again depending on what brand of paint they have a different method for how to mix it sometimes it's mixed with a one type of thinner and a hardener on top of that sometimes it's mixed with just a reducer and so what I'm going to try and convey to you today is how you figure out what needs to be added to the paint and what ratio needs to be mixed and nine times out of ten you can find that information directly on the side of the can this is a this is a very common pain as a PPG paint and it tells you with a picture and then also a ratio of the two different types this right here is a DBC and that's the actual base coat and the DT is a reducer so it mixes one-to-one with color and the reducer and so what you want to do is you want to get a paint cup that is specifically for mixing automotive paints it won't deteriorate it won't melt and then on the sides of the cup you'll see all of these different little legends and so if I want to mix one to one you find up here one to one on that paint cup and then each one of these marks corresponds to the level at which you need to fill this Cup you go up to the seven with the paint and then you go to the next column over and you go up to the seven with the thinner so it's one part of paint one part of thinner and you can see they have it already marked out for a whole bunch of different ratios 2 to 1 1 to 1.5 3 2 1 4 2 1 8 to 1 and then they also have gradients in milliliters ounces and just generic scale this is this doesn't mean anything so if you wanted to mix 1 to 1 you would go to 5 parts of paint go to the 5 line and then 5 more up to the 10 line with the thinner getting a little bit more complicated is this is a single stage paint and if you can zoom in on there you can see that there's a whole bunch of different options for different products that you can mix DCC that's this paint a DT is a reducer and then a Dec X is the hardener so they want this paint mixed 4 to 2 to 1 so that means 4 parts of this paint 2 parts of the reducer and 1 part of the activator or hardener so the way you would do that is you would want 4 parts of the one so you go four of the paint two parts of the reducer so you'd go up to six with the reducer and one part of the hardener so you'd go up to the 7 so it's 4 to 2 to 1 so if you do your math and you think about these cups you can pretty much mix any kind of paint here's clear coat this one's very simple again you always look at the side of the of the can and it says it needs to be mixed 2 to 1 so 2 parts of the clear coat with 1 part of the hardener again you can find that directly on the side of the cup used to find 2 to 1 and then all these different gradients correlate to 2 to 1 so if you only need a little bit of clear coat you'd put the clear coat up to the 2 mark and then the next column over you'd find the to mark and you put the hardener to the level goes up to that again here's a completely different brand but on the side of the can it tells you specifically how you're supposed to all the information you need now if hypothetically the paint mixing information is not on the can go to the manufacturers website and what I always keep at my paint mixing station is a three-ring binder and you can see this we've used this a lot and inside I print off all of the different types of paint that I generally use including the primers all of their technical information so DBC for example that was the first base coat that I showed you where you mix it one to one well if you go to the manufacturers website you can print off technical information specifically for DBC and they do a great job of outlining the different additives that you can use what type of tip you need to run for your gun all kinds of different things like the amount of time you need to spend between your coats so go check out the manufacturers website and you can download and print off all this technical information as well as safety information finally if you still are not sure after checking the website and checking the side of the can call the paint company that sold you the paint they should be able to provide you with all the information that you need as well as all the chemicals and all of the safety equipment that you need to mix and spray paint successfully", "dY3AVpzBAwo": "[Music] howdy friends today I'm gonna start building a new deck box for the 4runner but first I gotta take this one and all the crap in there out put it in the garage while I'm doing that why don't you go check out the video where I showed all about how this thing works and how I built it okay back to work [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right so it's done this thing is totally finished I got all of my tie-downs installed I've got the tie-downs that install it to the cargo straps in the 4runner this thing works great I really like the design we're out here testing it on a maiden voyage at this beautiful alpine lake off of Sonora Pass it's a really pretty spot Sonora Pass is just a couple miles that way we're probably about 9,500 feet really high super awesome so this deck works really well and the design I think works a little bit better than my previous design it's a little bit higher the gap here is a little bit taller most of all the table doesn't rattle the table is really nice it's a lot bigger - let me show how it slides out it's really nice I've got this whywould coated with some nice beeswax butcher block conditioner I can slide it out it's the same width as the top of this thing so I could slide it way out but obviously leverage I wouldn't want to use it much farther out than this but this is works really well it's really convenient it's really nice it slides out pretty easily but it's tight enough that it doesn't rattle at all under here I've got a few odds and ends over there I've got a wrench for the thule bike rack I keep some of the trailer supplies over there and the dog bowl in here I've got this bin which I'll probably rebuild I've got chairs to pocket some bug spray and sun block and this stuff stays in here all the time all year round because you never know what you're gonna want to pull your chairs out and relax for a while over here right now I've got this is my camera case all my camera gear is in here but this is the standard size for roll-aboard suitcase carry-on suitcase so this fits in here with ample room I've also got my tripod and over here strapped to the side with a quick fist I've got my shovel up on top when we're doing these trips with everybody we have the dog sits up here is plenty of room for the dog I've got a wolf box here food gear goes here and I can strap it down so it doesn't slide over and hit the dog and the cooler over there so when you want to stop to eat you pull out the table you grab some sandwich bread you've got some sandwich meat and you make it right here you grab a chair you sit down and then it all goes right back in close the door and you're on the road in no time it's really convenient it's a really good design I like it a lot if you like this if you thought this was cool you're gonna build one of these there's a couple of measurements you want to take note this will work with any SUV the measurements I used obviously are really only good for a third gen floor runner so the measurements are first the opening here from side to side it's nice to be able to just slide it in without having to kick it at a corner and an angle and and muscle it in for mine it's 48 inches for years that are probably different then you need to know the height of the wheel wells so you can get this end of the table above the wheel and without hitting it ours is about ten inches I think and then you need to know the width between the wheel wells so you can make this the uprights on the side exactly that width so they just sort of push up against them and then you can use the the cargo tie-downs to pull it tight and that'll keep it a lot tighter and make it more of a snug fit so it won't slide around and rattle around it'll also act as a support when the load starts shifting so yeah that's it if you want to build one of these go ahead and and let me know how it went if you have any comments or improvements on the design let me know those too because I'll always make on them and if you like this video go ahead and click the like button and if you want to subscribe go ahead and click Subscribe I'm gonna do more working projects say bye bye bud [Music]

to go on top of it as well some people use just powdered sugar the way can you see what I do all right so come back with me and we'll get started [Music] [Music] okay the beginning of this section of the video ID already existed all the ingredients in it how much you used but I'm showing you all the ingredients I'm gonna be using powder sugar butter short beans salt cream cheese softened butter and vanilla acts extract for both the dumplings gonna be for both and I'm gonna have total of four eggs cream cheese half a cup of melted butter and yellow cake mix which I prefer the duck tonight is perfectly moist and this part right here is gonna be the cake and that's gonna be the frosting all right so be right back and let's get started okay I've already put the two eggs there half a cup of melted butter and the cake mix will mix this up real quick I'm gonna probably mute the sound because this camera is really close to this mixer all right here we go okay now definitely you can see the consistency it it looks really silky smooth and fluffy at the same time so let's go put this in the arm p.m. be right back okay I sprayed the pan with the it's called PM baking see it has the flower in it it's going to keep sticking cuz you want this cake pull away from the sides it's gonna look like almost and also it's like taffy but you just see why it needs to be that way oh god that looks so good at two I could eat it off this there goes my sugar level spread it on there as evenly as possible once you have this type of cake you don't want to go back to the normal cake this is good alright that's about as good a good get yes I'm gonna link that here in a bit you okay now the next thing I'm going to do is reference to the GUI part is I am going to take that 1/8 ounce cream cheese that's been softened in two eggs and I'm going to beat them and cream them together before I add the confectioner sugar so here we go again okay there we go it looks a little bit smoother yes you're gonna have a few little lumps and that is okay because with my typing add the sugar and get that all beaded in just it will smooth out all right so here we go again add a little bit at a time you don't have a powdered sugar bump and start off slow scrape the other sides as you go that's the more tea has a full 16 ounces which is approximately 4 cups four to six cups you'll be able to chop eyes once you open up the 16 up I know what it's supposed to look like so if you'll see ok the consistency is very similar to what the cake looks the cake part looks like so let's go over to him put this one in the pan or is a glass dish whatever you want to call it be right back can you just pour it right on the top it spread it all over and you're thinking oh god this is never gonna bake to look like a cake not with all that trust me you're gonna love this okay guys most out there I can't but guess what I'm looking this spoon to be rad back okay this is where I get my cake my frostings better and I smooth that all over the top there we go put this in the oven at 350 degrees between 20 to 25 minutes go and check it you can either get a toothpick or a knife just remember this is a GUI GUI okay so there might be some gooeyness but you'll be able to tell the difference between GUI and raw all right here we go see you back to here about 30 minutes okay inside here I already have full cup of softened butter and a half cup of the shortening and then I get a little bit of salt that's muscular there and no let's blend these together first before we add the cream cheese and before we add the sugar so let's go well I hate to tell you this folks big blooper I thought I had the video I should say the camera recording well I was making this so here's what it looks like and I'm gonna show you what I'm gonna do with it they blue per se ok so this will be my blue fur frosty and I'm gonna have a poop or everything alright here we go alright be back in a few okay let's check this again I'm still all wrong yes I'd say you okay here it is with the cream cheese frosting I only did a little dab because this is a very sweet cake it has all those gooeyness let me see if I could zoom in on it look at that look at that GUI now you're wondering where's that other piece hold on there it is you [Music]", "9fZB4s38Ygg": "hi this is pressure Locker your parents or grandparents may have had milk delivered to their home and this mathematical problem relates to that custom imagine a milkman carries a full 12 litre container of milk he needs to deliver exactly 6 litres of milk to a customer but the customer only has 8 and 5 liter jugs can he measure out exactly 6 litres for the customer while taking 6 litres for himself he can obviously use all three containers in order to get this measurement the story goes this problem was asked to a school child in France around the late 1700s he was so interested in the problem that he went on to pursue mathematics this child was named Poisson and he's made many contributions to statistics so the question for you is can you figure it out how can the milkman measure exactly 6 litres and take home 6 liters for himself give this problem a try and when you're ready keep watching the video for the solution all right we have 12 litres of milk and the other two containers have 0 and 0 they start out with nothing so we're going to pour this milk between the containers and we're going to keep track of how much milk is in each container first we'll pour 8 litres and fill up the 8 liter container so that leaves 4 litres in the 12 eater container and we filled up the 8 liter completely we'll fill up the 5 liter container so we now have the amounts of 3 & 5 we'll take that 5 liter amount and put it back into the 12 litre container so we have 4 plus 5 which makes 9 we transfer the 3 litres from the 8 to the 5 litre jugs we now fill up the 8 litre container from the 12 litre jug so that leaves 1 liter of milk in the 12 litre jug and we have 8 litres filled in the a leader jug we fill up the five liter container from the eight liter jug and that leaves six liters for the customer the milkman can then take the five liters pour back into his twelve liter container and he is left with six and so now we've measured it out the milkman can take home the six liters of milk and he's provided six liters exactly six liters for the customer did you figure it out thanks for watching this video please subscribe to my channel I make videos on math and game theory you can catch me on my blog mind your decisions which

everybody, it's Charlotte. Today on\nMaker's Moments, we will be teaching you how to find out how much candle wax you need. Calculating the amount of wax that you will need depends on how many candles you are planning to make, as well as the total ounce fill for each container. First, you'll want to find out the total ounce fill for the vessel or container you plan to use. Many candle container companies will give you the ounce fill. For example, you can find the ounce fill for all the vessels from The Wooden Wick Co. under the description on each product page. Next, you will want to subtract an\nounce from that container's fill to account for your candles fill line. For\nsafety purposes you never want to fill a candle container to its full capacity.\nAlways allow for a minimum of approximately a quarter inch around the\ndiameter of your candle to be free of wax. To do this, you can subtract one ounce of wax from your container fill. For example, if my container fill is 8 ounces, I'd only be using 7 ounces of wax to fill the container. Next, you'll want to add up the total amount of your ounce fill by the amount of candles that you would like to make. Here, I'm making six candles, so I would want to multiply 7 ounces by 6 candles - I'll need a total of 42 ounces of wax. Most waxes out there will be sold in pounds. You will want to calculate the ounce conversion for your chosen wax. For example, virgin coconut soy from The Woden Wick Co. is sold in five pound slabs. This is equal to roughly 80 ounces of\nliquid wax, so I would need only one slab of wax and have some leftover for the\nspecific candle project. Ready to put your newfound knowledge into practice? How do you calculate the amount of wax you will need? Let us know in the\ncomments below. Don't forget to subscribe to our channel to stay in the know on all the latest maker's tips and tricks. See you next time on Maker's Moments.\nHappy making!", "ySJUhN7mQF0": "Hey hey everyone and welcome to my channel my name is Lisa and I will be doing a collab playlist with a bunch of lovely ladies out there and I'm so grateful and thankful for doing this Thanksgiving sides clap with them and I will take you to my counter and let's get started we're gonna have to swing you around a little bit I'm using my laptop so therefore yeah okay what you will be needing to make a green bean casserole classic green bean casserole is two cans of green beans I can't as mushroom soup some black black pepper some milk I got this from the Dollar Tree and some original french fried onions okay and what we will done as we will be just doing it all in one pan I got this pan here and let's get to it first of all you will open up your green beans and you are going to drain them so open that can and now I'm opening this can sorry for the angle guys I'm having like I said and we are going to drain the green beans okay we're going to dump just in the baking pan that we're going to be using so I'm trying to do this is my first slab and I'm gonna try not to mess it up I got one can of green beans in here already and I'm going to drain the other can my think is behind me sorry for the noise and we're dumping the other hand of green Beach and I will show you that thing see I have two cans of green beans in the pan okay and then I'm opening up my can of Hannah cream of mushroom soup which is also a flipped awesome and kind of cooks it out well it came out all right good okay and then we were add 3/4 of a cup of milk mixture which I'm just gonna eyeball because that's what I do I don't measure really anything so I'm gonna say about a half a can of this milk you want to do less not more just in case you go over so I put that in and then I'm gonna just add a little bit of little bit of ground black pepper do my mixture and I'm going to mix this up and then we will add some of the half bag of green French green onions in this I think I got too big of a pan for this but we will see I am mixing mixing mixing mixing okay this is my first collab so I will show you what it looks like you tell me stuff a little bit okay this is what your green bean casserole will look like after you mixed it up before the green onions or french-fried or in front onions all right mo test we got movement going on here okay and I talked about half this bag I made a small batch you can double this batch however you need I only made a small one because just my husband and I so I will humble these up and add these into this mix this up product here as soon as I get done plus about half the bag mix mix mix I'll have to move my laptop so y'all can see my dog is also working on the background anyway I'm gonna move my laptop just a little bit so I can show you guys what I finished that's what it looks like I don't know if you can get a good angle or I got a good angle for you to see but my kitchen is kind of dark as it is with lights or I don't have that many lights in here but anyway that's the green bean casserole and you will pop it in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes you will pop it in the oven for at 350 for 30 minutes check it see if it's bubbly and all good and then you will finish adding the rest of the french fried onions to the top and let it bake and get crispy these get golden brown on top for five minutes in the oven take it out in it'll be in and that's that easy and real time it takes 30 minutes so I will be right back with the finishing product up and I'm back and here is the finishing product product that I have done green bean casserole and I will take a bite sample it we yeah I put a little extra french fried onions on it it was really good and I hope you all will try this sorry about that hope y'all will try this recipe and let me know down below what kind of sides that you enjoy on Thanksgiving and I would like to say thank you for

sizable jokes I'm just going to add this triple and just add them all together because they're going to add it anyways yeah dicing the onion onion tomato you okay so i have meat in a bowl just going to get out all the lemon so sing it and i also have okra cut okra in a bowl they're all defrosted and they will be ready to mix everything together alright so we have our pan we're going to add excuse me um a little bit of butter because we have to melt them so this is a lot but i'll put in a little bit the butter so just melt the butter and then we have to add a little bit of flour so exactly how much of this it's called the roux I'm supposed to make i'm not sure but this is kind of what it turned out haha hopefully it'll be okay and it'll taste good i'm hoping so we cook we do this for 20 minutes and then we add celery and onion to it ok so now i'm going to add the onion shut up hey fellers and so do 45 minutes so it's not Cyn five minutes just yet so this is what it looks like next we're going to add some stop yeah so in the recipe it says you can use this stock or you can use half of stock and half of water so I'm going to use the half stock half water and then let's make sure that the flour butter mixture is completely dissolved okay so now we're adding the stock and we just have to make sure that that the roux is completely dissolved okay so oh no we are gonna add some water mixture you know how much you want to beg for more there we go and then we just cook this until all the roof is dissolved so um I didn't know what couldn't rise to get that we just I regular rice and we'll just put that in at the end so now we let it simmer for 10 minutes all right now we're going to add the meat and everything else okay now we're going to add some tomatoes and so okra you can do it we can rid of in oil ok now that spices so I have pepper I'm not really sure how much I should put in but um I'll put a little bit of it because it says an eighth of an ounce but you don't need something I definitely need to get over your pot so since the filet is missing I don't know how this is going to taste hopefully it'll taste okay the last thing we're going to add is the right I think we're going to let simmer for a little bit more before we add any of that because it's going to tell to get all the show okay so add at the right feels really good um now i'm just adding a little bit of salt for taste and we're all done already you", "MlunHqsUN4o": "hey there we're gonna be testing some stuff that shotguns have to offer we have a standard door here it actually came off of our front front door at a house and I can't think of a better way to utilize the door and to shoot it so we're going to test out some stuff that 12-gauge it's a bird shot a double ought buck and some slugs so we're gonna check it out see what can happen I don't expect the bird shot we'll start with bird shot to go through or even close to this is a standard metal door here so we just got some number eight bird shot it's just gonna most likely just hit the surface they're not do much but well see what it does alright being a pretty nice dead oh cool alright let's see what number four bird shot here alright that actually did it more than I expected that's pretty cool nice pattern there alright number 4 bird shot Wow I think I may have penetrated a little bit yeah we'll check well check it out after the double-aught buck here it's a double lock lock I think is gonna go maybe even go all the way through we'll see here so this is the standard double-aught buck suprema nine pellets alright here we go the other side there we're here we're fairly close it had a nice tight pattern let's go check it out all the way through oh yeah I see light so the door doesn't hold up hold up much it is a metal door though Wow look at that the birdshot almost went through there maybe a piece a couple spots there there's just a few few spots where it actually went through maybe one anyways that's surprising that's a pretty it's a pretty decent dip man that's awesome alright well let's see what else we got so next in line I've got the standard slug that one out slug so if it kills a deer what you think what do you think it's gonna do to a door I think it's gonna go through a little hollow point wow they actually made some dents around the side there oh very cool that's surprising okay and last but not least these are awesome these are Winchester defenders so the 1 ounce rifled slug and then they have three double plated but bucks buck pellets so slug with 3 Dunlop pounds very nice let's go check it out actually we'll check it out after wall well we'll just do a variety back here and we'll just kind of the rest the doorway here it might be kind of fun these couple more big shot the brute shots are actually pretty impressive to look at that's it alright so the rest we're just gonna have a little fun with that's cool I'll shoot the people all right this is so much fun let's check it out Wow a double up but it looks like every single one went through that is amazing ever single one went through like all nine pellets look at that gosh that would be some major devastation that kid he managed to get hit by that look at the people well it's people I'm surprised with this birdshot bird shots especially the floor the the number for birdshot room and packs a pretty good impact yeah look at that hole the way through just sistah punch the tree well there you have it a standard door out at the range it was a lot of fun I gotta tell you I'm gonna have a lot of fun just shootin the heck out of it and thanks for watching", "f0a0ZaEeXY8": "good morning everybody okay so in this video I've got something I got to talk about I've got a document what happened to me the other day wild squirrel hunting I picked up these shotgun shells at Walmart about a month ago right for squirrel season because they were like pretty cheap they were cheaper than the regular shot shells number six for squirrels they're cheaper than lead guys so I was like alright I'll try on so I want to show you what happened to them and what happened to my shotgun in this video so here we go guys [Music] alright guys I wanted to show you that this shotgun the other day I went squirrel hunting I loaded up I sat down and then I had to change locations so I had to unload my shotgun and when I was coming out of the woods and I went to unload basically eject the shell and then cycle the ones in here out they went in cycle so you can see there is still one in the tube I hope you can see it and this one will not come out so what I'm gonna have to do is take this shotgun apart take the doggone shells out through the tube and that was a real problem because when I was changing location I didn't have anything to take this thing out with and basically my my hunting day was about over and these are these super X teal shot so you can see them and see these so what I have seen and I hope winchester figures this out and recall some of these but the ends of these shells are not the same size I've had this happen before on some Federals and they wouldn't go through the tube I guess when you mass-produce these things these things happen so I just wanted to document this and say hey guys if you're gonna use these shells and you're a duck hunter especially thought of taking these out in my kayak my day would have been over because I wouldn't have been able to fix this in my kayak so this guy gotta take this tube out of here hopefully it yep there goes the end of the plot or the end of the tube and here comes a shell and boom and for you guys that are gonna yell at me the actions open that's weird that this bad boy would not go through the tube now just so we can have a test and y'all don't say that it's my shotgun I'm going to and yeah I have a plug in it I'm going to put this bad boy back together and then I'm gonna put some sure shot heavy Devils in here and show you that it's not my shotgun there's the other shell - alright put it back together put the barrel back on these things are pretty easy to take apart once you get used to don't lose the pieces oh and don't let the plug shoot at the top so hold it with your hand put it back together screw it screw the end cap on rock and roll all right now I'm gonna take some sure shot heavy double it's here one two three all right so these are just seven and a half short shot heavy Davalos but you'd shoot everything from dove to squirrels with and I'm gonna load them up so you can watch it's gun will cycle all right so here we go pressing it its cycles okay all right guys so that's basically the test all right the gun cycles those two wooden so I guess it's just these I don't have a diameter checker to see if they're different there it's like one of those situations where they're super close when you look at them at the back I mean there might be just a smidgen difference and I'm tough to tell I don't know if they're I mean they don't feel like they have a burr on them or nothing why they wouldn't go through the tube but they sure it wouldn't go through to but that's all I got guys I just want to make this video to say if you're looking at using these this is the issue I've had with them I don't know if it was like just a couple out of the box I don't really want to cycle the whole box and figure it out but just check them before you use them and if you find one that's irregular note it make a video so all of us will know like what's going on with these shells I'll probably shoot them until they're gone because I've already bought them and I can't take them back and you know so you know comment down below if you've had this issue with these shells if not put them a thumbs up and we'll know that maybe it's just this box or whatever but I'll see you guys later don't forget to Like and subscribe follow me on facebook at yak moly and i'll see you guys later

moldy or dry down looks like it came out of a booze ass", "z5kNNnjAZlo": "the life of a fisherman it never gets old so welcome to the show come on yo go away like hey everybody I want to talk to you about the recent going I kept Assad the South Jersey slam and if you live in the state of New Jersey especially in South Jersey you know what the South Jersey slam is that's a bag consisting of bluegill yellow perch crappie pickerel and finally bass and it was a really fun day on the water for being a wintertime pattern wintertime fishing is super tough and when the day started we fished a lot of grubs to catch those more aggressive cold water species the bluegill the perch the crappie and the pickerel all hit small finesse swim bait grub style lures and I fish that's that havoc beach at and I would just take it and bite it down fishing on a jig head and reel it slow off the bottom but the funny thing is in the winter a lot of times the bass won't cooperate to those faster moving baits you know the swim baits the grubs the jerk baits they ignore that stuff and they actually get super low to the bottom I mean they almost lay on the bottom and those wintertime conditions and we use the technique that's really neat and it's called a micro jig and you know I want to show you a small finesse compact jig in comparison to the micro jig and this is a traditional smaller jig this is the missile mini flip jig quarter ounce and it's a real small profile Jake look at it it's very small and in normal conditions that'd be a great small bait to throw but when it gets brutally tough like in the winter and the fish won't respond to any this micro jig becomes a real player and look how small that thing is look how tiny that micro jig is and if you look at it it's actually a sixteenth of an ounce it's more like a crappie jig size but it's got the features of a regular jig its skirted it's got a little fiber guard on it and it's got a little tiny trailer and that bait for us was the absolute key and compete completing the South Jersey slam in fact that little bait caught some giant fish three to five pound class fish on a little itsy-bitsy jig want to talk to you a little bit about how we fish it I want to talk to you about a trailer modification and then we'll look at the line the rod and reel and that's real critical you know but when they get really inactive in the winter and they're laying on the bottom ignore everything else the best way to fish this micro jig is what I call dead sticking and you know in the dead sticking technique you're going to make a really long cast to clear the water the longer the cache you want to make you're going to let that thing fall on a semi slack line until it hits the bottom and then once it hits the bottom you know your tendency is you want to jerk it you want to you want to pull it back you want to fish it like a regular compact jig but with this micro jig don't do it think about the fish they're laying low to the bottom they're lethargic and a lot of times in the winter like that you're not going to believe me but they do they're feeding on nymphs and larvae and grubs that live in the bottom also little tiny crawfish that's a big part of their diet in the wintertime and that's what we want to imitate with this micro jig we make that long cast we let it follow the bottom we're really not going to move it a lot at all in fact a lot of the time we're going to use the momentum of the boat and we're going to use the wind to be our r8 to move this bait every once in a while I'll pull in my slack and move it again if I feel something on the bottom if I contact a piece of cover I'm just going to real gently just so slow to shake it a little bit but the key to this bait is micro jig is to dead-stick it and to not hardly move it at all so key on that little tiny sixteenth ounce micro jig you know on trailers you want to match a small trailer to the bait and a little tiny baby chunk a little tiny grub is a great choice or a modification that I make on this micro jig all the time and it's taking your favorite of what I call broad tail finesse worm and I'm going to make a little modification that cuts the bait and and we've got a Berkley power bait this is their Pro g1 it's only four inches it's the perfect style bait to fish on a micro jig and we're just going to modify that bait to make it fit that compact jacket if you look at it it's four inches it's small it's natural looking and the first modification we're going to make is cut the length and we're going to cut that down to about an inch and a quarter so we're going to go ahead and just cut the body right off I've got a little tiny tail section and of course that that broad paddle on the back and then the second modification is to actually cut that tail and we want to cut it in the shape of a V just like a lot of the craw fish just like a lot of the larvae that have pincers on the bottom it's a very natural modification and I'm going to go ahead and get my scissors and I'm going to cut a v-shape in that plastic and just pull that middle section out and if you look what we end up with is that same bait we start it with and now we've got a beautiful little natural crawl larva cut in that trailer it's small it matches perfect to the size of the jig you know the last thing I want to talk about is the rod 3 on the line very critical you know when they get on the bottom like that and they want it barely moving action is so key and because of that I'm always using light fluorocarbon six and eight pound Berkeley try lean 100% fluorocarbon is a great line to use on the reel I like a 20 or 30 size reel with the middle-of-the-road ratio you want it a little bit slow - for sure - slow down but you don't want it to slow and then the last piece of equipment is the rod and a spinning rod for sure is the deal I like a seven to seven and a half foot spinning rod in the show I was using the Abu Garcia Ike series rod in the 7 feet 2 inch model it's a perfect finesse rod and it's medium action and look at the bend on that rod if you look at it about the 40% of that rod the first 40 percent is real tippy and that's what you need to make those casts feel the bite and set the hook the backbone of that rod is still there listen to me if you're having a super tough day it's winter times conditions and the fishery lethargic and toward the bottom put away your regular jig try one of those micro jigs modify the trailer and you're going to catch some fish too when a fish like him you know I'm fishing hard you might wanna say that I'm go away", "ar_13NACRqA": "welcome I'm drew I'm making these scrumptious simple easy apple dumplings and to get started I've got one granny smith apple it's the green apples you can find in the grocery store I filled it taking the center out and I've sliced them very thinly I have 3/4 of a cup of butter here this is like a stick and a half of butter and I've taken one of the wrappers off of the butter and I've lightly greased a 13 by 9 inch baking pan I have 1 12 ounce can of Mountain Dew here it's a soft drink I have 3/4 of the cups of sugar 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and here I have just a 8 ounce can of crescent rolls that you can find in your supermarket in the refrigerated section so over here I'm going to get started on melting the butter so off it goes while the butter is melting on low heat I am going to open up the crescent roll package it's like those biscuits that you can buy in the supermarket and actually I'm opening up the wrong end I guess I'm going to open up this in we're just going to fill it back all right now you have to hit this part on a hard surface like right in here this little area and it just pops right open see now you have these lovely fabulous prescient rolls now if you'd like to make your own dough that's great but this is just a really fast and easy way to get it made actually we're just going to roll this apart and as you can see we're going to start rolling it apart there as you can see where it's perforated I'm just going to tear that apart I'm seeing just going to tear it apart then you've got these little segments here get this and then we're just going to pull these apart you see and there we have a piece of dough here we're going to tear this one part and have this piece the wine here all right now you want to take your apples sprinkle your cinnamon and nutmeg over your apples and I like a lot of cinnamon and nutmeg now if you don't like cinnamon or if you don't like nutmeg you don't need to put it in also sometimes that walnuts in it and today I got decided just to leave after walnuts and to keep the apples from oxidizing and that's train Brown I added a teaspoon of fresh lemon juice to the apples once I sliced them and put them here in the bowl all right that looks pretty good all right now back to the dough now you're just going to take one of your segments like we are right here and you're just going to add a couple of slices of Apple just going to like tuck it in there and roll it up there we have our first Apple Dumpling all right and you want to come over here you're just going to put it in this buttered baking sheet just like that all right then we'll come back over here and we'll go ahead and do it to the rest of them until we have eight apple dumplings over here in our baking paper also you want to make sure that you have your oven on 350 degrees preheating we have a beautiful those cooling these are so delicious and so easy I'm telling you every time I make these it's within seconds of serving and they're all gone so you may want to double your batch if you have a lot of people you're feeding because again this is only going to make eight all right I'll come back and show you what it looks like here's our crescent rolls there's eight of them and they've all got apples in each and now what we're going to do we've got our butter melted and we're going to pour a spoonful of butter over now here comes the fun part now the granulated sugar you're just going to generously sprinkle over each just back and forth okay then we got our Mountain Dew here here's the Mountain Dew and it calls for about 3/4 of a cup and that's about a little over a half a can of Mountain Dew make sure that you don't pour your Mountain Dew on top of your dumplings just pour them around the edges of the dumpling because you want your sugar to a he's to the top of your dumplings and if you pour your Mountain Dew over it it's going to cause your sugar to come on all right so there I've got about I got a little over a half a can of Mountain Dew and now off to the oven please go for 45 minutes there's cookies in here for 45 minutes shut the door and use your timer no peeking 45 minutes or up on the dumplings and here's those scrumptious delicious apple dumplings and let me tell you the cinnamon the apples the sugars are just so all lovely come together all right I'm go at this cool for about um half an hour an hour and I'll cut into it and I'll show you what it's like it's really hot right now there's a lot of syrup in here the apples are SuperDuper hot and it's alright it's good more and it's also good cold so I'll come back and show you how I'm going to plate it up other dumplings have cooled off for about 30 minutes and I'm going to dig in and I'll show you what this looks like I'll bring a little closure see the sauce in there that it's made for the dumplings and we'll just bring it right we'll bring it right out and put it this way and we can add some sauce from the pan right over the top of the Apple Dumpling if I had some vanilla ice cream believe me I would be adding to my dumpling truck here alright then I'm just going to cut in it show you what it looks like on the inside see looky there all those apples and that cinnamon nutmeg you know it's going to be delicious okay still hot warm take a

hey y'all give me thumbs up like leave me a comment until next time I'm Toronto with foods 101 thanks for watching", "zVqunZUuwSs": "today on the stay at home chef I'm showing you how to make the most amazing lasagna you guys should know by now that when I call it the most amazing it truly is this recipe for lasagna is full of authentic flavor and homemade goodness you're gonna love it we're gonna start on the stove with some ground beef and ground Italian sausage you'll want to add a pound of each so we have the Italian sausage and then a pound of ground beef into a large pot over medium heat then grab a spoon and start breaking up all of your meat and get it cooking once you've broken it up a little bit add in one large white onion that you've minced up as well as five crushed garlic cloves stir this in and let it all cook you'll want to make sure you cook the meat through completely before moving on to the next step we're creating a sauce and so it's all about layers and adding things in one at a time and creating a delicious homemade creation it does take some time but trust me it's worth it in the end I used a 93 7 ground beef so that it's nice and lean and doesn't create too much fat and you can see there's not a lot of fat in there some of that is liquid from the onion that has released but we don't want to add too much fat to this the fat that you're getting mostly comes from the sausage and we're not adding in any extra fat either so it all balances out and it works out in the end next we're gonna start developing even more flavors by adding in a secret ingredient one teaspoon of fennel seed this gives it that truly authentic feel sprinkle that in there follow it up with one teaspoon of ground oregano do 1/2 teaspoon of salt 1/4 teaspoon of pepper 2 tablespoons of sugar 1/2 a cup of freshly chopped basil and a quarter cup of freshly chopped parsley stir this in real quick those fresh herbs adding a lot of flavor and give this pasta a fresh homemade feel follow that up with half a cup of chicken broth a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes 15 ounces of tomato sauce and then there's a nice secret weapon - 6 ounce cans of tomato paste tomato paste has such a concentrated flavor that we're able to add in a lot of tomato goodness in here with just a couple of ingredients we're really making that tomato flavor come out strong and bold when it comes to this sauce then we simply start stirring it and bring it to a simmer you can already see that this sauce is super Hardy and meaty and it smells absolutely amazing once it comes to a simmer it will reduce the heat to medium-low simmering is the time for your sauce to develop a lot of flavor the ingredients play off of each other and release a lot of different complex flavors as the heat is applied to it so you'll want to make sure that you simmer your sauce for a good period of time you'll want to simmer it for at least an hour and up to four hours for a really developed flavor now if you don't want to do this on the stove you can always put it into a slow cooker on high and let it develop flavor there you'll want to give it just an occasional stir and if it's in the crock-pot you don't need to stir it at all but this sauce is definitely made with a little bit of love and look at how delicious that looks while the sauce is over there bubbling and boiling I want to show you one of the coolest lasagna hacks ever you're gonna take your noodles and put them into the bottom of a dish and I'm just using a 9 by 13 pan you just want to make sure that the noodles don't come up over the sides and then you'll take some hot water just as hot as you can get it right out of the tap and we're going to pour this over our pasta you want to add in enough to cover all of the sheets of pasta looks like I need just a little bit more it took me about eight cups of water to cover my pasta completely now all I have to do is let this sit and soak for about thirty minutes after 30 minutes my pasta will be softened enough to layer in a lasagna dish no boiling required it'll finish cooking in the oven it's a perfect tack to save some time when it comes to making homemade lasagna well the noodles are soaking and the pasta is simmering we'll go ahead and put together our ricotta mixture start with 30 ounces of whole milk ricotta cheese and kind of break that up there you'll add in an egg 1/2 teaspoon of salt a pinch or an eighth of a teaspoon of ground nutmeg and then about 2 tablespoons of freshly chopped parsley then you just mix this all together all right now we'll keep this mixture in the fridge until our sauce is done simmering once the sauce is done we're ready to layer our lasagna in addition to what we've already made you'll also need some sliced mozzarella cheese and some freshly grated Parmesan cheese and make sure you use freshly grated because the stuff in the little can just doesn't melt nearly as well and isn't even always real cheese we're gonna start layering our lasagna by spreading about a cup of meat sauce into the bottom of a 9 by 13 pan and I'm using an extra deep 9 by 13 pan you just want enough to cover the bottom so that the noodles get some love down there don't get stuck then we're gonna start layering in our pasta I like to do it just a little bit off you overlap them just a tad and put four noodles four sheets as our base layer then we're going to spread on about a third of our ricotta mixture then layer on slices of mozzarella cheese and I got this cut in the deli section of my grocery store then you'll cover this with another layer of the meat sauce I use about a cup to a cup and a half not just enough to cover that cheese and then I'm going to finish the first layer by sprinkling on about a quarter cup of Parmesan cheese then we're going to repeat this process with more sheets of pasta and we'll keep on layering it and then we're gonna bake this in a 375-degree oven for about 15 minutes remove the aluminum foil halfway through the baking time to allow the cheese on top a chance to brown and then you're ready to eat now I know a lot of you will ask if you can make this ahead and the answer is absolutely you can compile everything and layer everything together in your pan and then just pop it in the fridge until you're ready to serve although I would recommend using and baking it within about 48 hours if you're gonna freeze it you'll want to add a ton of time to the cooking time in order to get it thawed in the center and cooked completely through [Music] thanks for watching you can

I will use a small kitchen scale and do everything based on the grams of dye so if I'm making a stock solution I will measure out say 5 grams of dye dissolve it in 500 milliliters of water for a 1% stock solution but this does add an additional step and has an additional server requirement and so there are some people who might prefer safer one skein of yarn to measure a quarter teaspoon on a teaspoon of dye and go about it that way the big reason to weigh your dye by grams versus by volumes is that the manufacturers mix these dye stocks they can keep it about the weight and the colors that you can achieve per weight of dye they recommend specific on weight of goods for example Dharma training company recommends and on weight of goods of 1.5% to 2% for most of their colors and then for some of their more saturated colors they recommend that you use a non weight of goods of 4% which would be 4 grams of dye per 100 grams to achieve the advertised color since I needed to make up some stocks today anyway I thought that while I'm weighing out my 5 grams of dye for each of these colors that it could be worth me using measuring spoons and measuring the volume as I go along and yeah who knows what we'll see as always I will be wearing gloves safety glasses and wearing a respirator while dealing with the powders so that way I don't inhale or accidentally get anything in my eye or anything like that we're going to start today with the paler cherry bomb and let's try measure one teaspoon of dye this is approximately leveled right here let's see how much the boys okay so that looks about two point eight grams right now all right let's do now a half teaspoon and again this is approximate okay so 4.2 4.3 it's good that there is some consistency on the food day for the same amount of that but it can really depend and the volume that you get in to the pen and how compact your powders are or even probably from color to color I'm not sure that we will see the same kind of weights with different colors necessarily all right next color is dirt navy and we're gonna get one teaspoon two point three grams so I'm gonna go ahead and do a second teaspoon oh that one was and that one was merde so the first one I got two point three grams the second one gave us about 3 grams of dye this one was notable because we get shootable teaspoons in a row and you can give us different weight I need the difference between two point three grams two point four grams and three grams insignificant the extra half gram of dye can make a difference in your depth of shape depending on the color now I think that we got such a different weight because one of our spoonfuls our second one that was more compact than the first one and so this was actually a really good example of what I wanted to show finally the last color I we know today is peacock blue and let's weigh out approximately a quarter teaspoon for about point nine grams second one that is pretty consistent so fun I was having consistency within this color but wait nine brands for a quarter teaspoon okay we've now added four quarter teaspoons and we have 3.6 grams again this is different a different weight per volume that what we've seen for the other colors this one is clearly more compact food I have been over filling my quarter teaspoon with this color definitely I definitely could have been doing that but oh yeah was measuring out what should be approximately one teaspoon we've got everywhere friend you know 2.3 to 3.6 grams which is a huge difference so why is this important and it really is only important if you're concerned about consistency because the density of your dye how compact or how fluffy it is can vary from when you first open it to when you use it a couple months later or even between one batch versus another from the same supplier so if you're gonna get like a huge variability when you're dealing with a specific volume of your dye powder then you could get inconsistent color results which is only a problem if you have a recipe and you are trying to replicate it so if you want to make a recipe for achieving a specific shade or a specific color way it makes a bit more sense to go for grams if you die more by feel and it's okay if there's some variability and what you within the end by all means you can go by volume there's nothing wrong with it one of my favorite techniques is just to go straight from the dye powder where I'm not doing any measuring at all I'm just dying by feel so that is absolutely okay but ultimately as long as you are consistent with the way that you measure the color you will likely end up with some reproducible results but there could be a fluke and you get one overpacked spoon and then suddenly your colors a lot more intense which you know you can always add more color but you can't exactly take it away so that could be a problem I am happy that I can finally answer a question and say alright there's between I guess like 2.3 and 3.6 grams of dye per one teaspoon and it really probably varies not just on the compactness of the dye but it could also vary a lot on the color different colors could have different volumes per weight just because they're made up of different molecules they have different amounts of filler and things like that when you're speckling with dermis silvered gray and true black the colors look of the specks of the actual dye and there looks pretty indistinguishable but there's no question that there's got to be some kind of filler in that silver gray dye stock so that way you can measure out a full gram versus having to do a fraction of the gram to get that more true gray versus sort of a deep gray this is something I talked about in the math of yarn dyeing where we actually went and looked at the different depths of shade of silver gray and true black and how they compare versus the amount of dye used for each of those scans I'll have a link to that video in the video description and my card anyway I hope that this was really helpful and helped answer some questions I have no problem dying by feel you don't need to do strict calculations to get beautiful results it's totally okay to go with the flow and just have fun but it's just when you want something more reproducible kitchen skills aren't that expensive and it's worth getting one one another thing the accuracy of your kitchen scale is something also to consider with this there's no question there can be some variability there and I know this particular scale has trouble when you're adding little amounts that are less than say point 2 grams sometimes in like itty-bitty increments sometimes those don't necessarily register right away it's important to keep that in mind and so if you're dealing with really low weights that you want to measure take that into account when you go and purchase a scale I am Rebecca from cabinets and if you found this video helpful make sure you subscribe

tablespoons of canola oil if you don't have canola oil just use an oil that has a high smoke content because we are going to do some toasting here so next I'm going to go ahead and toss in my 5 ounce box of avail I'm using this brand this is the one my grandma always used at the yellow box it's quality quantity fideo and if you don't find his friend that's fine just a 5 ounce box will do so now here is the long grueling task of toasting your video and you have to get this part right because if you do not toast it properly when you cook your video it will turn out mushy and you do not want that so take the time this took me like almost 15 minutes and here I have my toasted video you'll have bits that are darker than others that's fine but you just want to make sure that you toast all of it because this will ensure that the fideo will keep its texture and not get mushy okay next step I will be adding one chicken tomato flavored blue young-kyu and in a minute I'm going to show you a couple varieties a couple ways to get the flavoring but here's the blue myung-kyu but I'm just going to break it up into the pan okay now I will be adding about two cups of water and you can add another half cup if you like it a little bit more soupier but two cups works just fine so next I'm going to go ahead and add some garlic powder and you can add fresh garlic if you'd like I find my garlic powder very convenient when I'm pressed for time and now I'm going to add ground cumin and you can actually add whole cumin seeds you know I remember my grandma would use the molcajete and have whole black pepper peppercorns whole cumin seeds and fresh garlic and actually fresh tomato and she would just write it up in the mocha hit that and throw it in there so here's the other variety of ways you can you can season this this is also the powdered color the thematic once I water the oil which is chicken flavored blue on with tomato in it and you can just add a spoon of that or you can do just plain chicken blue on one cube of that and one small can of tomato sauce so those are a couple varieties of ways you could you know flavor your fideo now I'm also going to add some fresh onion you can skip this step but I love onion and you want to bring up your video to a boil and cover with your lid next you want to lower the heat and allow it to simmer for about 15 minutes just keep an eye on it and you do not want to lift the lid so try not to do that okay so it's been 15 minutes and here is our wonderful fideo mmm it smells wonderful and there is still some soup eNOS to that I guess in Spanish would say it's got a Google but you can see that there is some you know soup in there it's not completely dry but if you do like it completely dry that's fine let it go a little bit longer okay so now I'm going to plate this up in a bowl and I'm also going to add a long big ass which is a Mexican meatball or Mexican meatball soup and if you want that recipe for the add Wanda guys check out my gochujang Mama YouTube channel and you can get it there so I hope you try this recipe I hope you enjoy and thanks for watching", "6bJAxmStpjU": "if you love a good doughnut then watch this recipe I'll show you how to make incredible apple cider doughnuts that are baked not fried now let's get to the recipe shall we the very first thing you got to do is reduce one and a half cups of apple cider down to a quarter cup the step is gonna concentrate the cider flavor and reduce some of the unneeded liquid in the doughnut batter next grab another pan and place it over low heat it can be a fry pan or another small sauce pot it doesn't really matter we're gonna use it to brown some butter so melt four ounces of unsalted butter in the pan swirling it as you go until the milk solids start to brown slightly then immediately pour the butter into a bowl to stop it from cooking the solids will continue to brown a bit so keep this in mind during this step now it's time to mix most of the dry ingredients together so grab a large mixing bowl in a kitchen scale start with all-purpose flour and weigh out six and a third ounces followed up by a quarter ounce of baking powder this is gonna act as a leavening agent in our donut batter add a 1/2 teaspoon of both kosher salt and ground cinnamon and finally add a quarter teaspoon of freshly grated nutmeg to the rest of the dry ingredients ground nutmeg works good too but come on slow mo microplane shots yeah those are pretty hard to pass up and shoot the video how digress anyways stir everything together and put that bowl aside grab the scale and another mixing bowl because it's time to measure out the rest of our ingredients for this donut better grab the light brown sugar and weigh out 3 and 1/8 ounces now I'm sure these standard measurements sound kind of wonky and that's because I weigh out most of my ingredients using metric units you can find those conversions in the description box below the video ok add 1 in 2/3 ounces of the brown butter that you prepared earlier along with 2 whole eggs add that quarter cup of reduced apple cider and 2 and 1/3 ounces of regular plain yogurt finish the wet mixture off with one teaspoon of vanilla extract or you could set out with the seeds from about half of a vanilla bean give the mixture a stir and make sure that everything is fairly homogeneous you'll have to get aggressive with the whisk but for every discipline effort there's a multiple reward and that's a dozen donuts my friend now take the dry ingredients and marry them with the wet ingredients then grab your whisk and stir everything until it's smooth and combined but don't ever mix because you'll get a chew your donut that won't rise enough here's a good shot of how the batter should fall off the whisk now I've mixed the ingredients together for only about 30 seconds to a minute max once the batter is mixed grab a tall glass in a pastry bag the 16-inch length works best but if you don't have one try a gallon sized a ziplock bag cut the bag a few inches from the tip to form an opening about a half inch thick then shove the bag tip first into the glass and fold any excess plastic over the rim now that it's positioned carefully pour the donut batter into the pastry bag you might have to lift the plastic in order to get all of it in there but that's going to depend on what size glass you are actually using for this recipe you'll need two donut baking pans and I've left an affiliate link in the description box for easy access now spray all of the cavities with cooking spray or you can butter them whatever you prefer then grab your batter and start piping you only want to fill the cavities about halfway full anymore and you'll lose the donut hole when the batter rises in the oven give the pans a quick tap just to get rid of any giant air bubbles then pop them in a preheated 350 degree oven for 10 minutes and voila now you have one dozen cider donuts now I forgot to spray the pans on this badge so I'm suffering the consequences here this is a perfect example of the idiom do as I say and not as I do anyway move the doughnuts from each pan onto a wire baking rack and let them cool for about 5 minutes or so long enough to prepare a cinnamon sugar coating so to do this combine 1/2 cup of granulated sugar with 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon in a mixing bowl the amounts will give you extra but it allows you to easily toss the donuts around in the mixture I like to add a little something extra just a pinch of ground cardamom this paired with a nutmeg in the donut batter is reminiscent of a classic apple pie spice and it's a perfect fit for cider donuts now take some melted butter melted brown butters best and working with one donut at a time brush all sides with an even coating immediately dunk that butter basted donut into the sugar cinnamon cardamom apple pie spice whatever you want to call it coating and give it a good toss make sure each doughnut is evenly coated then place it back on the wire rack and let them hang out until you finish the entire batch all right so what do you think thumbs up or thumbs down on this recipe let me know in the comments section below thanks for watching and I'll catch you next time", "YsDkWsR-BRM": "[Applause] [Music] welcome to video one of our baby vests leather armor little baby armor here the first thing I want to say is you know while you're learning with me doing this I'm also kind of learning how to do all this video shooting so hopefully everything will come out looking good and you'll be able to follow along with that said first thing we're going to do is Mark out our pattern now here i have my pattern for the baby vest armor you can get this pattern on my gum road account which i'll list in the video description if you'd like to do that or you can try to recreate something yourself using photoshop or or something like that I have a 11 x 17 printer and that seems to have worked out great for anything that I've needed to do okay this right here just so people know is called underlayment it's a product used to put in between like hardwood flooring but I've found it's a great material for pattern making that said I've the reason being is you can mold it you know format however you need to and it has a lot of rigidity though to be able to withstand actually putting in Brad's to simulate rivets the buckles and all those kind of things you can actually kind of make the armor first almost what do they call it in a dress making you know you can kind of use this really cheaper fabric make it first make your your item let's make sure everything is going to work once that's good you know hey this pattern is going to work and everything's going to work for me that's what this underlayment is good for so all that to say i have my front pieces here the left and the right this is the back piece this is one solid piece and these are the pieces that will go on the shoulder to make the pull dhryn okay now the thing with cutting out patterns is you want to make sure that you don't just throw things down in the old way you know I'm going to put this over here this here this here and these whatever you want to try to maximize the amount of space you have by really finding the best way to lay out your pieces so they take up as little extra space as possible you want to try to leave as much remnant as you can for future projects that said you do also want to consider the grain of your leather at the same time as you can see this letter has a particular grain or pattern that runs this way has this a little extra bit has some marks that go down through here of course what's nice with the more kind of stuff that we're doing with LARP and cosplay sometimes it's okay to have things will look more rough and rugged because you want them to look used so you can kind of get away with not having to really follow the grain all the time you can mix and match a little bit and just have fun with the natural look of the leather now this is a 4 ounce leather reason why it's 4 ounce it's just referring to the thickness here there's a chart that talks about what all the ounces in what they refer to or how they reference the thickness of the leather yeah I can't remember right off the top of my head I just know everything by feel at this point I just know I can feeling up yeah that's about four ounce so that's eight ounce that's an ounce so on and so forth so for this since it's going on my son I figured hey I'll go with four ounce leather things I would make for myself it's going to be armor it's generally going to be that eight to 10 ounce range alright so we've kind of look at the grain here I think what I would like to do is put this way let's put it this way i'm going to lay down my back piece first okay and i just use a standard ballpoint pen to mark out the pattern some people are going to use maybe chalks or you know other different writing utensils a guy that taught me took one of his classes he actually marks everything on the front which is fine because a lot of times you're going to be doing beveled edges and those kind of things so you actually end up removing a lot of the stray marks I just can't bring myself to do it well just lost all my patterns I can't bring myself to do that so I had to do it on the back it served me well and I'll continue to do that so let's begin marking another great thing about the underlayment is since it has a more of a thickness to it I can just run my pin along the edges and not worried about any kind of weird slippage you don't have to be too too precise on this you're not trying to get perfect perfect lines you're just wanting to get that general shape down also with my pattern I've marked all of the places where I'm going to tie everything together so for my son's case i'm not going to Rivet this i'm going to actually just use suede ties that way as either he gets you know if he gets bigger as I'm making this thing or what have you I can use the suede ties to make things bigger or smaller and adjust things of the court you know accordingly and not really make things super coat you know uh what's the word I'm looking for help me out everybody type in the chat what's the word I like it before oh well so this is the back and I'm just going to go ahead and write that and that's fine it's going to be on the inside so i can write down what all that is okay next up I'm going to put this is the I don't know how to pronounce it necessarily it's either the lame or the LA may notice the part as me right above the elbow I'm going to put that right here okay set that to the sign and then try to figure out obviously what you need to be careful here when you have pieces like this that are mirrored you want to make sure that you don't put them facing the same way because you're just basically making the same piece so in this case I'm using this kind of as a guy this is the you know one side of the underlayment it's going to remind that okay this is the back side of that so i can probably get away with something like this yeah and make sure we're still kind of running the same grain so we'll do it like that one thing you want to be careful that sometimes on the edges you can get these waves and that can be hard to get out of your leather so I just want to be care you just wanna be careful that should I want to do it like this okay I'm trying to get you know kind of close to these as possible again we're trying to reduce the amount of extra remnant space just want to make sure maximizing the amount of leather well there can be expensive so we don't want to waste too much if we can help it get the most out of it as possible all right there's mark these these are going to be or is tied in front boot boot boot boot and this is where it's going to connect to these sides here and then it connects there okay again I'm not trying to be super precise with my lines that will come when I actually cut everything out using rulers and all that kind of stuff that will kind of clean up don't I don't want to be too wild don't have a pretty good pretty good markings ok like that okay and finally this is the actual pulled room piece so I think it hit my mic there so one thing I didn't do with on purpose with the shoulder pieces that it is I didn't mark how these are all going to be tied together just yet I'll wait to do that once it's finished because we're going to do straps and those kinds of things so don't want to mark in how these are going to connect just yet that said I will mark you sign that this is the neck next slide this is the shoulder side and of this side here this is the elbow this is the shoulder side okay so i just wanted to mark those widen as I knew so I can kind of reference back okay this is how these are all going to be this is make sure I don't screw things up later alright so that's marking the leather pretty simple process you're just trying to you know find the right leather flip it around put your patterns down you can use just regular paper if you want it does work carp some people use cardboard stock that's fine too whatever going to work best for you but again I found underlayment to be the best for me it is kind of two step process obviously because you're printing it out on paper you're transferring it to the underlayment and then you transfer from the underlayment to the leather but in the end I think you have a really good product okay so next up cutting the all the pieces out we'll see you then", "9AMatvQNyrU": "[Music] welcome back one hot biters we are making something so much fun today we're gonna make a filo dough pizza so we're going to use phyllo dough sheets not the

course we've already made our our filling so now i'm going to show you how we're going to layer these beautifully so our oven is preheating at 375 degrees i am going to go ahead and lightly coat our baking sheet with cooking spray and then we're going to go ahead and get our sheets going okay so we're going to carefully unroll our sheets and they're super delicate okay so the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna cut all these sheets in half okay let's bring our cookie sheet over so we're gonna take one little sheet on our and it's lightly coated with cooking spray coat each sheet with a little cooking spray here's number two number three okay here's where we're going to add two tablespoons of our cheese mixture [Music] just kind of spread it out as even as you can alright here we go again three more layers one spray two spray three geez we're gonna do this five times okay this is our fifth layer we're gonna do only two sheets this time one okay we're gonna spray our last layer another two tablespoons of cheese and we're gonna thinly slice our tomato [Music] we want to get rid of any moisture as much moisture as we can so we're going to put all of our tomatoes on a paper towel [Music] we're gonna pat it dry [Music] [Music] we need to add our remaining cheese on top like any other pizza and pop it in the oven for 20 minutes okay all out of the oven we are gonna go

gallon and 2 gallons. And what I want to\ndo in this video is try to convert this quantity\nof fluid, this volume of fluid, I want to convert it into\nthese other units within the US customary system. So I encourage you\nto pause the video and first try to\ndo the 1 gallon. Try to convert it into quarts,\npints, cups, and fluid ounces. Well, 1 gallon is\nequal to 4 quarts. So we can just multiply by 4. 1 quart is equal to 2 pints,\nso we can multiply this by 2. So 4 quarts, each\nof them are 2 pints. 4 times 2 gets us to 8 pints. Each pint is equal to 2\ncups, so we have 8 pints. Each of them are\nequal to 2 cups. We're going to have 16 cups. And then finally, if we're\nconverting from a cup to a fluid ounce, each\ncup is 8 fluid ounces. So if we have 16 cups, it's\ngoing to be 16 times 8. 8 times 8 is 64, and it's\ngoing to be twice that. That's going to be\n128 fluid ounces. Now, let's do the same\nthing with 2 gallons. Try to convert that into quarts,\npints, cups, and fluid ounces. And I encourage you\nto pause the video and try it on your own first. Well, same idea. 1 gallon is equivalent\nto 4 quarts. So 2 gallons are going to be\n2 times 4 quarts, or 8 quarts. quart is 2 pints. So if we want to go\nfrom quarts to pints, we'd want to multiply by 2. So this is going to be 16 pints. And then each pint is 2 cups. So multiplying 16 of them, then\nthat's going to be 32 cups. And then finally,\neach cup is 8 ounces. 32 times 8 is going to be? Let's see, it's going to be 256. And notice something here. When we went from 1\ngallon to 2 gallons, we essentially increased the\nquantity of gallons by 2, or we multiplied by 2. And you see that\nacross the board here as it's going from\n4 quarts to 8 quarts. This is going from\n8 pints to 16 pints. This is going from\n16 cups to 32 cups, going from 128\nfluid ounces to 256. When you increase the volume\nin gallons by a factor of 2, you're, of course, going\nto increase the volume in any unit you measure\nit in by a factor of 2.", "Sxhm6HTetZU": "[Music] so [Music] hello everyone and welcome back to my crafting world this is anna guys i was making some coffee you know the little miniature coffee cup i was making some holders that are holding some candy inside and a gift card on the back so my daughter is going to give her niece and nephews one of one of these each and i was down to my last one i thought you know what let me make a video just in case just in case somebody hasn't um seen how these are made they're really really simple and i'm going to show you how i have made mine they turned out really cute i really like them so the uh traditional red and white ones are for the boys and we are going to make one um for a girl so i am starting out with a sheet of cardstock this is 110 pounds a sheet of cardstock that is um two and a half by 11. now i found that that was the perfect size for this project so that being said two and a half by eleven and we are going to do some scoring so let me get my scoreboard let me show you where we're going to use today we are going to use the stamperia uh pink christmas and i am going to use a chipboard as well so the these i got from asc crafts and i'm going to go ahead and link their web store and their etsy store in the description box along with my coupon code so we are also going to use one of these four ounce coffee cups and i am going to link these as well i got these from amazon so i'm going to link these in the description box as well so they do come with the lids therefore are going to score at three quarters of an inch which is right here so remember this is a 110 pound cardstock so score at three quarters at three and a half and you know me i like to score a few times so it i don't score all at once and crack the paper and then we're going to score at four and a quarter okay and then the last score we are going to make at seven okay so um that's all the scoring we're going to do i am going to go ahead and round my corners before i forget i am using the quarter inch corner uh rounder the cropadile the quarter inch size and i am going to go ahead and die cut a circle okay so this is the top this is the bottom this is the front of the cup holder and this is going to be the actual cup holder so what i'm going to do is i'm going this is a two inch circle um it's a plain circle just your your basic uh circle so i'm going to take this over to the um cutting machine and i'm going to cut this out right here i'll be right back all right guys i have die cut my hole for the actual coffee cup right here and that fits nicely i had to figure out how much was left at the bottom so i know how much how tall to uh make my space here this is all we have to do to this piece right now so the next thing i needed to do was cut out my sleeve that's going to go around my coffee cup which is this one right here and the way i got this template was i cut the coffee cup in half i removed the bottom and then i went ahead and cut off the rim and that is my template so you know that gives me a perfect fit around the coffee cup okay so after i cut it up i put it down on my paper i traced it and then just cut around the trace line that's how you get your template for your coffee cups and you know the package of coffee cups i don't remember how many that there are but there's a lot so i'm going to keep this for uh the next time i need it so after i cut my uh my sleeve that's going to go around my coffee cup i just put glue on the back i did ink the edges with worn lipstick so all i did all i need to do now is glue it down now i don't want it right on that seam either because then it just becomes too thick so i'm just going to move over a little bit and start to glue this down [Music] [Music] there we go there we go guys it is on here and it looks like i do need to trim this just a little bit and i'm going to do that right now i'm just going to take my scissors and just go around the rim and make sure that it is down right up against the cup okay so there is my cup nice and covered okay now the next thing i'm going to do is is i'm going to set this cup aside and i'm going to go ahead and start to fold this so i know exactly where my folds are going to be and whatnot so i'm going to burnish that really well let me move this because i i'm finished with this for the moment so i'm going to burnish my score marks and this is the way our cup holder goes okay so before i glue that down i find it easier to go ahead and cut my mats and glue them down before i actually glue down the cup holder itself so let me give you measurements for these mats so the mat that goes right in front of your cup holder the front mat is two and a half inches wide by 3 and 1 8 inch long so that goes right here i'm going to go ahead and glue that one down way so i'm going to go ahead and do the top one and these i cut three three of these these are two and a half by two and five eighths and on the top one all i did was take my circle i die and i centered it right in right now as centered as i can get it and i die you know i cut it i ran it through my machine and i cut it and that goes right here okay i have glued that one down now i'm gonna glue my bottom piece right here there we go okay that's what we have so far now we're gonna go ahead and glue the back one so that the back one is gonna go right there okay so i have the bat the back on i have the front on so what i'm going to do next is i am going to um glue this one on there okay so that is the back it's so much easier to layer once you are before you assemble it it's so much easier to layer so i'm going to take my front piece and i'm going to glue that down right there okay okay and i want mine to look totally finished so you don't have to do the inside but i am going to just because um i can see the inside maybe because i am the one that's making it what do you guys think that's probably it but i'm gonna go ahead and cover the inside okay guys so there is that we're still um this is the way it goes this is where our cup is going is gonna go before i glue this down i'm going to put a pocket in the back for the gift card and that pocket i'm going to cut at i cut my piece at three and a half inches wide two and a half inches tall and then i scored a half an inch on this side half an inch on this side and half an inch at the bottom and then i just merely folded it in like that okay and then what i'm going to do now is i'm going to cut half a circle because i have to make them all the same otherwise the siblings get a little upset the other ones have a half circle on the back so i'm going to do that here and then i'm going to simply glue this down i'm just going to put glue on here and we'll go from one side to the other okay [Music] and that is the pocket for the gift card okay guys now i'm going to go ahead and glue this down this way okay and it is complete after that there so while that dries okay so that isn't that cute she's gonna love it okay so while that is driving drying i'm going to of course you can decorate your cup however you want but these are kind of plain so what i'm going to do is i'm going to put the little lid on there and i simply took the circle that i cut for this top mat fits perfect on the top okay because it's a you just need a two inch circle on the top as well so i took that circle and i added one of the rosettes that i got from raquel at paints and glitter during our swap and i went ahead and removed the little circle that was in the center because it didn't actually match the paper so it was really easy to remove she did a really good job of staying pretty centered and i am just inking this vellum paper and i am going to glue it to the top of the lid like that and that is going to be the top of the lid now i have two choices i really don't want to use hot glue and i have not used hot glue for any of the other ones either i'm just gonna use good old art glitter glue [Music] and just so you guys know i'm going to put the uh link the facebook link to asc craft supplies the vip group because they are having the 12 days of christmas giveaways today they gave away this enormous package you know that whoever won that was lucky lucky so all i'm gonna do is go ahead and glue this down and it fits right over the top all right guys i think that is glued down pretty well and on the other ones i went ahead and tied some um twine around the rim i don't think i'm going to do that that with this one i think i am going to put some bling around there [Music] all right guys there is her little bling blinged up cup oh i just love that so i am going to add a bow to um [Music] to the top there we go guys i just added a little bow with the bling center with a half back pearl on the center and she's ready to go of course you know we can do a lot more embellishing but um this is all i'm going to do to it so here is that one oh my gosh aren't these cute i kind of want to add some bling to the front but i'm going to leave them like that because again these are for the kids and hopefully you know i mean kids don't pay that close attention to anything so this is the way they turned out guys i may go ahead and add their names to the front i think that would be cute but um yeah this is the coffee cup holders with a pocket for the gift cards oh my gosh guys i love this one i can't wait to make one for like valentine's day oh i just can't wait all right guys here we go you can put chocolate in there you can put you know the hot cocoa you can do different candies you can you know if you're gonna send this off in happy meal you can put some small embellishments you can do uh you know crafty supplies oh my gosh i just love this i really truly do i love the way it turned out guys so i just thought i would show you really quick how to make these in case uh you don't have measurements or something like that and there we go guys thank you so much for watching i appreciate each and every one of you thanks a lot guys y'all have a great day", "clTnjq2Ww0Y": "hello and welcome to the art of cooking today we're going to make duck sauce or plum sauce if you use plums instead of peach just use whichever fruit is cheaper or in season this also is very versatile you can serve it with egg rolls or you can use it as a glaze for pork chop for instance so let's get started select peaches that is right and solve when you gently press on it remove the skin from the peach if you want to easily peel the peach make an X Mar on the bottom with a knife and blanch the peach for about 35 seconds in boiling water then place it in ice water blanching the peaches will loosen their skin and make them really easy to peel this method is only economical if you have a lot of peaches to build since I'm only using one peach I skip the plantain stem cut 250 to 300 grams or 9 to 11 ounce of features into bite-sized pieces the actual amount I have is 279 grams by Veen several pieces along the way which reduces our mount to 253 grams yeah now thinking about it I should have been three more grams to make it two-fifty even anyways Vince one cloves of garlic 5-grand 0.18 ounce it's ten grams or point 35 pounds of onion let's make the sauce add the garlic and the onion into a sauce pot no oil lightly saute for 10 to 15 seconds on a medium low heat adding the chop peaches and cook for about a minute or so make sure to stir often so it doesn't burn I didn't have a teaspoon of salt 1/2 cup or 100 gram of sugar and continue to cook for about 3 to 5 minutes I then 1/4 teaspoon of red chili powder this chili was not spicy at all but it will give the duck sauce its orange color next add in one cup or 235 milliliter of water cook for about a minute or two so all the flavor will come together put the sauce mixture into a blender put the lid on and make sure to place your hand on top of the lid while blending the ingredients together so all the sauces won't spew out and splatter on pulses several times just until the chunks of features are in small pieces we don't want to puree this put those sauce back into the sauce pot let's make this slurry in a separate Bowl work put in 1 tablespoon or potato starch and 1 and 1/2 tablespoon of water and mix pour the slurry mixture in and start to thicken the sauce next turn off the heat then add in two tablespoon of white vinegar if you are using other vinegars such as rice wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar etc make sure to reduce the amount as these vinegar are stronger than the white vinegar lastly add in 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne pepper this is optional as this gives a little kick to the duck sauce the red pepper that put in earlier didn't give any kick to it so I want to kick it up a notch to make this spicy anyways I hope you like this recipe and

meal we made in celebration of our wedding anniversary recently we usually dine out to celebrate but we haven't dined out since the start of quarantine back in march so we wanted to continue taking these safety measures so instead it's a date night at home for two well two and a half and this entire three course meal costs less than 60 bucks way less than it would have been if we dined out so let's jump right into it we did a majority of the prepping the night before after ray went down and the hubs helped me here so i wouldn't be in the kitchen all night i always prep the night before every meal i plan on cooking so that i don't have to worry about rey clinging onto my leg like a monkey or pulling onto my shirt while i'm prepping food with a big knife in my hand so doing this the night before just makes my life so much easier with a toddler so the first course here is butternut squash soup this is a very fall and cozy weather type of soup and not only is it delicious but butternut squash has so many good health benefits so i'm gonna post the exact measurements in the description box below but here i'll be adding vegetable stock minced garlic some carrots granny smith apple a medium sized butternut squash some white onion salt and pepper and then some cayenne and a pinch of ground cinnamon and nutmeg [Music] so i really filled my crock pot to the top so i'm just going to add a little bit more veggie stock just to make sure the seasoning gets into the pot and give it a little mix and then i'm going to top it off with a fresh sprit of sage cover the lid and put on high heat for three to four hours so i decided to use a slow cooker instead of my instant pot because it gives me time to make all the other food so everything will come out nice and hot when we're ready to serve i was actually doing several different things at a time but to make sure these recipes are easier to follow along i will edit the vlog by the meal course so after about three to four hours turn off the slow cooker discard the sage use a fork to check if the butternut squash is tender then add some coconut milk to this i have a light coconut milk here you can also use unsweetened if you prefer then afterwards mix it up and using an immersion blender to blend the soup is probably ideal but if you don't have an immersion blender you can carefully transfer the soup into a regular blender and do it that way use the extra coconut milk that you have as a garnish at the end give it a little bit of swirl to make it look pretty and add some black pepper to it that's our easy butternut squash soup as the first course so moving on to our main entree we are going to be making surf and turf for the filet mignon i will be using a sous-vide to cook the steak because that's the only way i cook my steaks because i want it perfectly at medium rare so you need to season the fillet with some salt and pepper and seal it using a food saver or you can also use a ziploc but just make sure to release all the air out of it when you drop it in the water with the sous vide so just in case you don't know what a sous vide is it's the best thing to have in the kitchen if you want your meats like steak chicken or pork chops to be cooked at the perfect temperature without drying out the meat your meat will stay super moist and so juicy and you never have to worry if you're serving undercooked or overcooked meat so i love this sous vide and i'll link it below for you guys if you guys are interested in doing more research about that so medium rare temperature for steak is between 130 to 135 degrees fahrenheit i will set the sous vide to cook to 130 because we're going to sear this on the cast iron afterwards so i don't want to set the temperature any higher to prevent overcooking so after adding the steak in the water you can see that the temperature is going down because the meat is obviously not at the desired temperature right when we put it in so it usually takes about one and a half to two hours for the steak to cook if you forget about it and leave it in there a little longer the sous vide will not overcook it so while that is cooking i will rinse and cook the brown rice and the broccoli since those will be our size for dinner we only make brown rice at home since it's healthier than white rice and honestly there really isn't a whole lot of health benefits in my opinion with white rice compared to brown rice however when we used to dine out we do order white rice because it does indeed taste better so it's nice to have it once in a while [Music] so after the steaks are cooked remove it from the bag then pat dry before searing the hubs actually took over this part and helped me since rae started to cry because she wanted me to hold her since i've been ignoring her the past couple hours in the kitchen you're gonna need to add some oil and make sure the cast iron or pan is really hot it only takes a couple minutes to sear and the point of this is to give it a nice outer crust to eat and it just looks more appetizing this way so add some butter rosemary and garlic cloves in here sear both sides for about a minute each then baste it for a little and that's it just let it rest afterwards for about 10 minutes before you cut into it or serve it we decided to slice it up before serving but you can also just serve it whole on the plate so moving on to the surf part of the main entree so i actually forgot to prep the parsley last night so i rinsed dried it in the spinner and chopped these up very quickly you'll see later that i should have minced it up way more for the lobster tail you need to use some kitchen shears to cut down the middle of the shell but don't cut the actual tail all the way on the bottom then afterwards pull apart the shells and push the lobster bead upwards above the shell then mix together some melted butter dried rosemary thyme cayenne and fresh parsley but more minced up i clearly didn't mince it up enough here so i just used some scissors to cut it up because i didn't have time to get the cutting board out again i was on a time crunch here because i wanted all the food to come out around the same time pour or brush the butter mixture over the lobster tails and broil in on the top rack for 10 minutes these are 10 oz lobster tails so it usually takes about a minute per ounce to broil so that's it for the lobster tails the most simple recipe ever and i only spent 10 dollars per lobster tail here and this main entree just looks so bougie looking and it wasn't even that much our last course is dessert we'll be making some egg-free chocolate chip cookies rae is able to tolerate some dairy more than before but she's still very allergic to eggs so we'll need to whisk together some flour and baking powder then in a separate bowl mix together softened butter regular sugar brown sugar vanilla extract and i'm using almond milk here but you can use pretty much any type of milk then add the flour mush from earlier and mix it up [Music] then fold in some chocolate chips i'm using the semi-sweet chocolate chips because i didn't want to make the cookies overly sweet but it's all personal preference you can use regular milk chocolate chips instead then afterwards just transfer the mixture into a separate bowl cover and chill it in the fridge for about 30 minutes then bake it in the oven at 350 degrees fahrenheit for about 12 minutes and that's it so i had initially planned to make this a true romantic date night with dinner served on white tablecloth flowers and candles out but this is true life i'm still in my pajamas but honestly i wouldn't have it any other way i'm grateful for my family and this is my happiness which is all that matters at the end of the day good job baby you're so yummy right [Music] so after dinner rae had a quick change of clothes since she had soup all over and now it's time to bake the cookies with rae and this will also be her very first time eating cookies did you spit on it put it back okay good job here we go in the oven now okay it's gonna come back it's gonna come back you gotta give it some time so it can cook okay you need to cool down first before you can touch it blow it are you drooling because you see cookies it's coming baby it's gotta cool down okay hold on baby so good yup thanks so much for tuning in today guys i hope you all enjoyed this video and if you're new here don't forget to subscribe i'll catch you guys in the next video [Music] wow", "iS2btOQiJWw": "[Music] we're making old-fashioned mac and cheese today so we have some very heavily salted water that is rapidly boiling you want it to kind of taste like like the ocean I know that sounds gross but that's the best way to do it when you are boiling pasta and then we have just the very small macaroni noodles I'll use any pasta really for this but this is what we have and we have four cups and then just give it a stir and you want to boil your pasta this will probably take about eight minutes or less because you want to boil it until it's al dente which is it's done but it's firmed in this medium sauce sized saucepan I have a stick of butter and 1/8 ounce package of cream cheese and it's on low I'm going to add 3 cups of whole milk just to help it melt down and so I don't have to babysit left the pot this may be enough liquid however sometimes I have to add another cut from the edge so you just keep this on low and just stir it occasionally and once the the milk kind of warms up a little then it'll heat the but it'll heat the butter and the cream cheese enough for them to melt so now that our pasta is finished I'm going to just rinse it really quick with some water so it doesn't stick too much because it's gonna sit until the rest of our stuff is ready to go point you pour in a large bowl now that our cream cheese milk and butter mixtures melted we're going to temper our eggs and this recipe because it's old-fashioned Mac I use six eggs but before putting them in you want to temper them with the warm liquid there's still a few chunks of cream cheese but that's okay I'm just slowly whisking as I'm pouring in the hot milk cream cheese and butter probably should have had a bigger bowl you just don't want your Mac to be Curt curdled you can definitely tell them it has eggs in it when it's finished but you don't scrambled eggs well let's do one where we go for to our macaroni noodles the chunks you see is an out curdled milk it's the leftover cream cheese and it'll melt down when you put this in the oven now we're going to add the tempered egg mixture with your six eggs two teaspoons of sea salt two teaspoons of garlic powder she's been at onion powder a couple shakes of cayenne it doesn't make it spicy it just brings out the flavor a teaspoon of black pepper but about a teaspoon of turmeric [Applause] [Music] to see spoons of butter tablespoons you get a paintbrush and you start painting them and a 9 by 13 hand and I'm on my third can pan now insert everything into your pasta add about two cups of sharp cheddar the same in mozzarella cheese and then fold that in I usually hold off on the fourth cup of milk to see sometimes it just seems like it's has more liquid than others if you don't want to use whole milk you can use half and half you can use heavy cream you can use you can lighten the recipe up a little and use tack milk and half chicken stock a chicken box and you just stir that in then you pour the mixture into a 9 by 13 pan then we take about a pound of cubed sharp cheddar try to evenly distribute it and just poke it under the surface you can use Velveeta at you if you'd like or you can just omit this completely this step but I personally like to brighten a big gooey half-melted pieces of cheese it's thrilling I just poke them down in there and if you don't like sharp cheddar you can use mild cheddar Colby jack or and then we top it with parmesan I've also done the bread creme and and butter mix on top because it makes it pretty and golden brown now you're going to make it 350 degrees for about 45 minutes okay this is what it looks like when it's finished and just so you know if you don't want to turn your oven on you can put this all in a slow cooker on low for three to four hours thanks for watching [Music]", "F4vTbISChe8":

reeling the Blues first thing today I want to say thank you for taking the time to click on my video and watch it and if you like what you see please subscribe you can use the little subscribe icon right here on the screen or you can wait till the end the video or you can just search my name you really like you go and click that bell and that way you'll be notified when I put something new on there well today what I'm gonna go over is I got a lot of questions about a drifting video I done and people seen the stick weights I was using I like to use stick weights cuz they're just easy I use them for everything but I mean you can order a stick weight mold but if you notice these are a little bit different and they're pretty easy to make actually these are here weigh about 2 ounces and this one right here weighs about 4 ounce let me show you how I make my sink Ramon's you look right here there's the 4 ounce and you'll see I've got some other bulbs on it's ok I can flip it around like this and that gives me my 2 ounce pose it's pretty simple all I use to hold together it's just a simple nut and bolt once I take him for the lid I'll just turn it upside down and shake it the lids fall right out I can make a couple hundred no time at all with this alright let's show you how we do this alright the first thing you're gonna need to make these synchro monsters is but you're gonna need aluminum aluminum is the best product for doing it because I've got a couple reasons it gets good and hot good and quick it cools down pretty quick and it doesn't distort as bad as steel would if you're trying to make these out of steel they wouldn't last two or three pours and they would distort twist to the point where you couldn't get a good pour anymore but what you got to do is you got to decide how big a secret you want to make this right here is about 3/4 inch thick aluminum but the mold the sinkers I'm gonna link right now they're not gonna be quite so big they're only gonna be about two and a half maybe three ounces so I'm gonna make them a little bit smaller so I'm going to use half inch aluminum and I've got some half inch aluminum scrap laying around so what you got to do is you just I use the table saw you can use the skill saw but I use the table saw for the table saw you can set it up and with the accuracy of a table saw you can cut them nice and straight and you can get good moles because that's the biggest thing you need you need them to be good and consistent like I said I'm using a half inch thick did you see this an old piece of a half inch plate aluminum I had laying around I use it for everything so we're gonna rip this down and get our sink remember [Music] [Music] all right we got it ripped down and you can see what we have here it's a nice consistent peach that's about I didn't even bother a measurement whole ranch is tall so that ought to make some good sinker so I should be able to make sinkers there so around three and a half to three and three-quarter inches long and the reason why I like to rip it in a long piece like this is that way I know it's the same thickness from end to end now then I can cut this and when I cut this then it give me my to have some ammo all right the next step we got to do is we've got to rip down we've know what we're gonna do here you don't really want to make the molds too awful long because the longer you make them the more likely they are to warp in the center's I found that about 7 inches works out to be about the perfect perfect size so we'll just mark this at 7 and we'll mark it 7 again all right I should give us the perfect moles we're going to get that cut feeling using old miter box I keep around the house just for this purpose right here [Applause] Lexile we gotta do see how it's got these little birds around it we just gotta get rid of those burrs [Music] [Music] there we go - good clean pieces now I'll just sand all the burrs off for the edges here where they can fit together nice and tight and that way to be the basis for sync Ramone [Music] you [Music] now we put them together so they fit perfectly tight there's no gap whatsoever and they slide smoothly so that means everything is nice and true we'll move on all right on these sinker molds instead of having all the individual holes for the pins like I made on these what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do something a little different it's gonna be the first time I've ever tried this I'm gonna try to put a pull pin toward you pull one time and it pull off pin out of all the sinkers at one time then you can dump them out so what I've decided to do is I've got a quarter inch well it may be a quarter inch just might be a three sixteenths note this is a one-eighth brass rod so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna set my table saw because the kerf on a blade is 1/8 on a Skilsaw plate most the times so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna set it to where it literally cuts 1/16 of an inch deep inside these molds by doing it this way as long as I run both molds through from the same direction like this then the gap of being the same spot you just got to make sure you got pick which side you want to be your face side and from what I've seen this is the best side that's the smoothest on these molds so I want these both these are gonna be my insides and I'll compare them and see if I mean they're pretty true cuts because I ran both pieces at the same time you don't make no difference at all so what I'll do is I'll call both of these the bottom so now all I got to do is run these through just like this where the X is facing me and the X is facing out and I should be able to get it right and put a pool in [Music] [Music] there you go that gap don't look like much let's see that gives me a perfect template now I can run an eighth inch drill bit into that gap and to keep the droop the drill bit nice and true and then run right in there and then I can put this brass rod right inside there and pull it right out as you can see from the first part it's not really that hard to do it's a lot of little steps but it don't really take that long to do it so now we've got this ready now I'm going to show you how to bolt these together and what I'll do is I'll drill a hole through these I'll put a bolt through to lock them as tight together as I can that way everything stays nice and true while I do all the drilling to make the single I know it seems complicated but it's really not if I wasn't filming this I could make me a mold and about 30 minutes or less and that's a taking my time so hopefully you'll be able to make your own after you see this okay so what I've done you can see I've got them lined up perfectly where I run them through the table saw and I need to drill an eighth inch hole so what I'll probably do is I'll drill just sixteenth over or Mesquite sixteenth I'll probably drill about a thousandth over an eighth inch that way this brass rod is slide cleanly through it now if you don't have a drill bit that's where you got pointed into the thousands you can drill a eighth inch hole or you can drill one size smaller and the smallest you can get right below the eighth and you can always sand this and polish off with thousandth or so all right let's get it done I just remember when you're drilling this you want to be pretty accurate so take your time the slots we cut should guide this right down through there with no issue whatsoever [Music] I'm not trying to guide it I'm just let me go because that's what we cut in here she'd got it right down through there [Music] [Music] now you can see that's just slide right down in there no problem alright so as you can see this is nice and smooth here maybe a little rough because I could have been a table saw but they're both the same high same everything I've got it setting up on this so you know all the pieces are pretty much equal and you know I run it through the table saw and then I run a eighth inch bit through that gap to make it round and the reason why I done that was that way I can use a brass rod as a pull pin now right there's what you got you see I kind of got a little stupid right here I was trying to use a really dull bit but I went got a sharp bit once I got sharp bit and eat right through it with no problem it's gonna do that style that always pays to have a long bit I tried to do it with a short bit from his side a short bit from that side and they were dull and they kind of wiggled a little bit but for the most part it won't matter because this is just something for me to slide the black the brass right through all right and here's your brass rod that's half the thickness of the brass rod sinks in that so when I put this like this you see what that does it just gives me a way to make the holes in them you can see how easy that pulls in and out now it's really really tight it really won't matter when the reason why it's because we're gonna put clamps on it or we're gonna put bolts on these to use for clamps but that way you just loosen the bolt turn this a couple times slide it out and then you'll have your sinkers so now let's go ahead and get the sinker portion done and I'll show you how I drill it out to make the what I call it drift weights because there's just stick weights I use them for drop shot and drift in for perch for about everything the next step we're gonna make is decide what size sinkers we want to make and really I can make these things up to 1/2 inch in diameter it just depends on how big you want to make them what I'm probably gonna do on this one I'm probably gonna make most of them about 2 ounces I've learned that if you make them around 5/16 or 3/8 it gives you about an ounce if you go up to about close to 1/2 1/2 inch and end up getting you closer to 3 to 4 ounces depending on how long you pull alright so the next step I'm going to do I'm gonna go ahead and lay the brass rod inside of it and I'm gonna go ahead and put the two pieces together and now that I've got that done I'm gonna take a clamp and clamp them together as tight as I can and then what that's going to do is it's going in it's going to ensure that they stay lined up perfectly and what we'll do is we'll drill a hole right right here next to the edge we'll drill a hole right here next to the edge and what that hole is for is to accommodate us running this 3/8 bolt through it and what that does is when you're making you sinkers you just spin it tighten it up pour you sinkers loosen that nut the mold instantly just flops apart you shake it dump your sinkers out tighten it up back down you can just keep pouring alright now we're getting ready to drill those holes this thing is 4 inches I want to put them right here close to the center I want them a little bit right here so I'm gonna put a little bit off this edge so I'm gonna say 2 inches 2 inches and I'm gonna set them about 3/4 left 5/8 off the outside edge that gives me plenty I'll do this one final eats off the outside of the edge normally I always drill a small hole just to get it started so I'll just kinda like dimple it a little bit with a drill and then I'll use my drill press to finish them up and then after I get this one drilled I will just set it on top of the other one and then drill through this one through the other one that way you're not trying to drill through both of them and trying to keep them steady I'm trying to do is just pretty much get a spot to start I you see I've got the the little holes here just something to give me a guide we'll go and get that drill take your time you want to get nice smooth circle try to go too fast and make it wobble and make it out around all right since we drilled this on a drill press if you look real close you can see these little burrs sticking out every time you drill something always just taking get you a little piece of sandpaper and just kind of work it and that removes all them little burrs because you don't want anything that's gonna put any gap or any space between these two forms and we'll clean the whole thing up after we get it all drilled out we'll clean the whole thing up like say seems like a lot of steps but it's really not if I wasn't filming it I could make this whole mold and less less than an hour on a bad day an hour okay so here's what I was talking about we got these already drilled in this piece of our form and this piece of our mold so what I'm gonna do I'll lay the piece of brass in here and what that does that keeps those lined up it's imperative that that part be perfect perfectly lined up now you can see this form I can't shift it at all this mold the top piece and the bottom piece are locked together real good most time I'll put a clamp on it and then drill these holes but we'll just put her in a drill press and go ahead and just Mark those next holes by drilling through these and that way we know they will line up perfectly and as you can see that is the exact size of that bolt so what we'll do is we'll get this side drilled out that side drill now punchy's all the way through and then drop our bolt through all right we got these lined up perfectly got this through got this side flush let's go ahead and get our holes drilled for the other side you notice they're going right through the old homes that I just take your time because that drill bit will try to walk when you first start once you get it good and started we're know we're on drill press we'll be fine [Music] all right so we got that one right here I already punched all the way through we'll just go and stick our bolt through it and once we stick that bolt through it actually acts as another way of keeping this lined up perfectly [Music] now could you do this with a drill without a drill press absolutely would it be as accurate yeah it probably could be but it'd be a lot harder to do all right well now we got our forms made our molds I drilled the holes through you can see where I got a bolt run through that way when you pour your sinkers are you gonna do is just loosen these up a little bit shake the mold and your sinkers will fall right out now you'll notice I've got this thing gapped open and I'll explain to you and show you why here in just a second so what I've done is I've stuck a washer in between here it made little gap the reason I made that little gap that way when I go to drill is the drill is gonna want to follow that gap where if I hadn't pulled dead tight when I was drilling it if you didn't have it perfectly level the drill bit would want to walk off to the side a lot if it walks off a little bit to the side here it ain't gonna hurt a thing and if you were doing this using a hand drill you can see it'd be a whole lot easier for this thing to stay on path now what we're gonna do we will drill a small hole first I'll probably go even smaller than this one I'll probably go just enough to where it's a little bit bigger in this gap we'll drill that hole first we'll punch all of them and then we'll go up maybe two sizes and punch them out again and we'll go until we get up to the size of sinker we want to make alright now let's go ahead and lay everything out now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna space these out about 3/4 of an inch so what we'll do is we'll go I hate these little teeny tiny ones here make it right see my own thing here there we go we got them all spaced out 3/4 and that's what we're gonna make our holes that all the way through all right here we go all right one thing I wanted to point out getting it up to this stage took a little time you know getting this groove made in here and getting all that done now if you is making these stick weights just to use as something to fill a let's say a piece of PVC pipe or even a rubber hose that you were going to use for drifting so you don't have to go through this stage right here that cut 15 minutes off your total time right away you can go in just skip straight to this step just make your moulds get your pieces straightened out so let's say we were doing that you could just get you to pieces aluminum of equal size clamp them together drill these two holes through here like that and then you can skip straight to this stage and make you some pencil weights now like I say quarter-inch is about the perfect size now like I go plumb up to half-inch I even have some that are a full 3/4 inch round and I rarely use those so I don't make that many of them anymore all right here we go and just remember take your time don't get in a hurry to drill these holes because that's what's gonna set the holes for the whole thing if you get these all goofed up then the rest time are everything from this point on it's gonna be kind of goofy just remember when you go into this take your time go slow because if you don't it's going to want to walk all right let's go and get started you hi the other advantage to putting those washers in there you notice all the shavings were falling out the bottom they weren't getting caught up in the drill bit so it gives you a lot cleaner hole all the way through also alright now let's move it up to the next size drill bit [Music] okay I'm done drilling them I took the spacers out and I took the bolts out and see here's what you have now if you wanted to leave them I belong I can't you'd have to drill them a lot bigger of course because we got the pin coming in from the end now my other mold I've got the pins I get individual pins and each one of them and the way you do that is you don't do this part you drill everything out you go and do all these drills here and then all you just simply drill a hole with your drill press drill you 1/8 inch hole in each one of these about a quarter of an inch up from the em you drill one side always drill one side once you get done with that side clamp you two molds together line them up perfectly drill through the hole you've already made all the way through and then go ahead and drop your little pin or whatever you're going to use like say I use brass and I've got these little brass pins that I just drop in and then when I drop them in I'll drop this one in I'll go to this in drill that hole all the way through drop a brass pin in it that locks your mold together that way it's not moving around and then I punch all the rest of the holes and every time I punch hole just go in and drop your pin in it and that way they're all lined up alright now let's go ahead and make this one as big as I want it I'm wanting to go up this right here would be about an ounce and a half I'm wanting to go up to about two and a half to four ounces since I want my mold to be round so I can strop them inside of a piece of pipe we'll go ahead and take all these oblong holes and like say it seems like a lot of unnecessary steps but trust me by drilling those holes there to start with with that spacer these right here gonna be nice and true most people to try to do this using two piece of aluminum they get so out of whack to run through that I mean you watch how easy he is just going right down through that back gap perfectly I'm not doing anything to keep this straight up and down I'm just holding to keep it from spinning the drill bits are gonna follow that gap there we go we got them all rounded out so that's on the sinker Saint Paul one two three four five six I'm four seven at a time what I'm gonna do now I've already cleaned this up already washed all the oil off of it so what we're gonna do now is we'll go ahead and run our bit back through this hole here to make sure that all the shavings and the birds are out of it and then once I do that she's ready to start pouring sinkers really wasn't that hard all right a little dirty but that's what she looks like pretty little mold wasn't really that hard to do let's pour a few sinkers and see what it looks like okay there's your completed bowl now these bolts make it nice to always use longer than what I need I just found these two when I'm get done when I get ready to start using it I'll put bolts on here that are about four inches out this side and what I'll do is I'll weld these nuts inside of two little pieces of pipe about that long that way I can actually just turn the pipe tighten the nuts down pour and then loosen them up and when you loosen them up she'll just think I flex so then all they gonna do is just flip it over shake it a little bit and all the weight to fall right out and then all you gotta do is push it back tight spin these nuts back down tight and pour the next batch where's my brass runt before you pour your next batch and before you tighten it down slide you ride him pour you sinkers loosen this up just a little bit to kind of take the pressure off turn this pull it out turn it upside down shake the sinkers out again like say the process goes real quick once you get the hang of it all right let's go for some sinkers and see what we get for a form let me show you what the inside of it looks like net is finished I've already sanded it and cleaned it up let's say this is a brand-new mold so your first couple pours may not be that great because it ain't seasoned it out yet and you may see something where you got and a singer wants to hang in it but there you go can't get much better than that let's see what we have here everything lines up nice and neat there's the holes there's my brass pin where I pull it out and it gives you your place to hook your swivels all right here we go for our first poll now just remember when you're working with Liz it's dangerous normally I always wear gloves or wear face protection the whole nine yards and I always do it outside where it's well ventilated all right I've got this set where it's kind of a medium drip when it comes out you can set it as fast as you can as it go but I'm gonna do this we're kind of slow at first to see what we'd come up with all right here's the first poll knock that little bubble off you can see the holes are big enough that you can see right down in [Music] where we go I got seven of them poured we'll take it in there was a little bit more light will pop the mold off and see what we got all right here we go we just got done pouring our first batch of lead in it let's see what it comes up with first thing you want to do loosen these nuts just a little bit turn this to get it broke loose so that it ain't stick it to the lid anymore I'm going to wear it gloves this thing's pretty warm go and hold on to it right here pull this out there we go we got that out of it gonna loosen these up a little more you know oh we should have to do is just shake it a little bit and there's our list all right there's enough of me you saw me pick up the ones that fell on the floor they're gonna be a little warm there we go seven let's really didn't take that long before and for the first pour that ain't bad most time you have a cup of them that it gets stuck in it and you got to do a little sanding to get any burrs off but as you can see these turned out real nice I think these turned out great and like say this is just one way to make the mold hopefully by watching this video you can make all kinds of different molds and if you look at this mold I made you notice I used a smaller bit first I drilled it all the way down and then that way it makes it smaller on the tip and it makes it where most swivels a hook right through it this one is four ounces right here and then if you flip it over on the back side these are two ounces and I just use the same thing as this right here I just cut them in smaller pieces and stick your one through each hole so when I'm making the two outsides put them just like that and you will notice they're oblong because I put the spacer in there but I never drilled them out real and then when you want to make bigger ones just flip your mold to the other side aim for you big for answers like I said you can do all kinds of different ways now so hopefully that video helped you I appreciate you watching as always thank you for watching if you enjoyed it please push the subscribe button and ring that bell if you ring that Bell every time I post a new video a fishing or how-to you'll be notified [Music]", "TriN15znAYw": "hey hey hey this warrior hola it's another math video my friends oh my goodness look at the snakes woohoo like my reptiles this year that we're gonna be solving problems involving fraction division in this video that I'm going to do today it may be long you're gonna have to hang in there it will be covering a lot of material this videos more of a review over many of the lessons prior on eureka module 4 this is less than 27 so we're gonna go ahead and review our key strategies for problem solving whether good buddy mr. snake yeah okay anyway it says first of all model a problem ok can you draw something what can you draw what conclusions can you make from your drawing we've been doing a lot of modeling with mathematics and clearly making sure that we visualize what we understand that is one of the biggest keys in math look you guys trying to come over here go back okay now we have calculate to solve and write a statement calculating the planning that goes involved when we're doing that it's important that you guys get a chance to solve the problem and then making some kind of statement of your understanding the solution and of course we always assess the solution so the solution for reasonableness you hear me use that word a lot in my videos because it's really important that when we come to a solution that we don't just say hey I think it's right I'm pretty sure no we actually ask ourselves does that answer seem reasonable based on what I'm trying to find out and your dude another steak their problem one we have mr. Silverstein bought three mini cakes for a birthday party it says that she cuts each cake into quarters and plans to serve each guest one quarter of a cake how many guests can she serve with all of her cakes we're gonna go ahead and draw a model to support your response okay so again I'm always gonna go back to you right there's many many many times and that's that read for understanding draw and then of course the right which this statement much of what we just covered so making sure have a good understanding I understand that she has these three many cakes this is acting as the dividend she's going to be cutting the cake in two quarters that suggests that's going to be the divisor because that's the group size and then we're going to try to find out if one quarter is given to each guess how many guests could she serve with all these cakes so I when I see here and my understanding is we have a whole part and that whole I think of is that as those are the three mini cakes we have the three mini cakes and she's going to create quarters okay we can think of that is maybe taking a line here and I'm gonna make thirds here there you go something like that that represents of course each cake and now I want to make some quarters so I'm gonna split this one in half and there's my last quarter and I've only drawn right now at this point what we're understanding from the problem some definitely important points that want to go ahead and write down first of all is I can see that there's four fourths okay in each hole that lets me know then if I were to take since I have three holes I can say three times four okay is going to equal twelve then twelve fourths and our problem in the division equation I can see is three divided by our quarter and based on our model I can see that the answer is going to be twelve and I can also double check my work by saying well twelve times then that one-quarter should get me back to my hole my dividend in this case yes if we were to multiply that we would have 12 over 4 and of course 12 divided by 4 is 3 and there's our three mini cakes so now my statement that I must write which I believe I have prepared might look like this okay then this silverstein can serve 12 guests a quarter of a cake okay name okey-dokey let's go on to another problem another word problem for album 2 hey it looks like Garfield in some lasagna by the way my favorite food lasagna love it alright this is mr. pham has 1/4 pan of lasagna left in the refrigerator he wants to cut the Latanya into equal slices so he can have it for dinner for 3 nights how much lasagna will he eat each night draw a picture to support your response and of course all of these questions important about drawing the picture I'll bring down so here's my little board here so it's a car again I'm looking at my reading I'm understanding that there's how much lasagna there is that's all there is 1/4 pan and then I see that he wants to basically create those equal groups so he's spreading it out over three nights that lets me know right away that I can get my dividend so I'm gonna go ahead and bring my tape diagram out again and with my tape diagram I can show my quarter however I'm gonna do something like what I've done in a previous video which is rather than trying to label this whole thing as a quarter we're just going to go ahead and just call this whole thing as if it were just one whole pan of lasagna by doing that whole number this is going to help us out when we break it up into fractions but that's the quarter then that would mean that this would roughly be the halfway okay so this is the half we need to get a quarter so I'm gonna take another one of these okay so here I'm just showing this is a shaded showing that one quarter amount of the lasagna I see our division expression as our 1/4 divided by those three if this is 1/4 and this is the whole pan I need to actually divide this into those three nights because none of this is TLAs on this is the rest of the pan but there's only that quarter pan here I have my my thirds so I've created my three nights first night second night third night so I want to show you here this is our 1/12 now we have 1/12 because if we have 3 here we took this one whole we divide it into quarters here's our 1/4 2/4 3/4 for quarters so if there's 3 12 or I should just say 3 here 3 times this is our unit here 3 units here and we have 4 of those units means that we end up with 12 and here we just think of it as 12 12 I think that spelled right don't hold me that it to that and so that's what we have here and here's our 1/12 showing them this is how much each person would get so our answer here is going to be 1/12 1/4 divided by 3 is equal to 1/12 now the rest of this this this shows the 12 and I've just extended that here and the dotted lines indicates that's not something that was we used as part of the problem other than to just show the whole and this is how we're breaking it down well finally we would have our written statement that we'd want to put so basically this mr. pham will eat 1/12 of those on each night for 3 nights which would be 3 12 here over the in course well 3 12 is equal to 1/4 perfect let's go on now it says here we have problems freezes the perimeter of a square is 1/5 meter okay it says we first we have to find the length of each side in meters we have to draw a picture to support our response here and then it says how long is each side in centimeters it looks like we're to be doing some metric conversion here from meters to centimeters to answer all that's been asked what do we understand well we understand that the perimeter is 1/5 meter that's helpful it doesn't give us the each side length in meters so it's just one side here that I don't know what the measurement is and that's what we need to find out well let's think about some things that some things that we do know okay we know that the perimeter of the square is 1/5 meter so that's something that's important that's going to help us now rather than again going and right in 1/5 beter as a whole let's go ahead and just do one meter there I have my 5 by 5 pieces so that's 150 meter 2/5 meter 3/5 meter fourth it 5/5 meter it's the same as the equal to 1 hole right 1 meter so I've shown that I'm the drawing now I'm gonna go ahead and shade in my 1/5 meter now I have my I have my 1 my 1/5 shown here I'm gonna go ahead and Mark that our division expression would be 1/5 right divided by 4 ok so let's summarize again what we have here we have that perimeter of 1/5 meter around the square it's the perimeter that means it's each side is going to be one-fourth of that fit because we have four sides to the square so I'm gonna go ahead and break that up into fours see I have this in fourths so my 1/5 now has been divided into fourth because this entire perimeter is 1/5 so each side is going to be one-fourth of that 1/5 so taking that 1/5 and divided by 4 as my division expression equation says here well there's four parts in 1/5 then how many parts would there be in 5/5 you see we're doing a little bit of multiplication here so let's do some multiplication here if there's 4 and there's 5 parts aren't we taking 4 times the 5 so we end up with 20 that means each one is a 20th 120th of a meter this is where this makes that really handy having that so we're gonna end up with 120th over here and keep in mind not to be confused but this is the part we created that shows the the quarters we created within the problem here we didn't use this Bey we only shaded this because this is the one-fifth of that amount therefore one side of this square will be one twentieth of a meter I'm going to go ahead and write that so here we have the length of each side is one twentieth of a meter now if we took one twentieth checked our work we could take one xx times five so we can check our work by taking our 1 xx times the four sides which is 4 over 20 which is going to equal one fit and that does it gets us back to our dividend the amount of the perimeter going all the way around now it says how long is each side in centimeters so conversion we need to know some information we usually only have to deal with a few centimeters is one there's 100 centimeters in one meter okay there's 1,000 millimeters in one meter okay there's 1000 meters in one kilometer these are the commonly used measurements well if we have this in meters we need to convert it into centimeters how do we do that to go 4 meters to centimeters look at the difference we have a power of 2 tens so we're going to need to multiply the meters by 100 so let's take 1 xx that's one side we're gonna multiply that by 100 again that's just 100 over 20 and now we have a power of 10 here which is really this is just 10 divided by 2 so this is just going to be 5 centimeters not a really long side okay so that's going to so each side and I'll write this down will equal or each side is 5 centimeters oh my goodness there's a and B we have a name be here problem forces there's a pallet holding five identical crates weighs a quarter ton how many times does each crate way draw a picture to show you to support your response and again how many pounds does each crate way and they're gonna have us again do this conversion from tons to pounds so we'll need to know how many pounds are in a ton go ahead and and it says to draw a picture just show well again we don't have a whole number here this is my dividend though this is what's being divided because of napela there's a pallet that holds five identical crates there's five crates on one pallet but the whole thing weighs a quarter ton so I'm taking that one quarter ton which is my dividend this is the size of the group here five to determine how much he create ways we don't want to use our quarter ton we've been doing the whole time let's do the one hole that will make things much easier later as we've learned because this is a quarter ton we're going to need this okay I've split this into quarters now I can show my one quarter ton here now I've shaded in Mike one quarter so we had that one ton okay I'm just showing this down here we're not dealing with any of this here alright this is the other three quarter tons which we don't need and this is just to show that we have broken them up into five because we need five identical well I'm gonna go ahead and show that with this okay this shows the five crates in that one quarter ton and we're trying to determine what the weight is for one crate so I'm going to go ahead and mark that this little spot right here well what is that amount well if we have five in one quarter ton that one means we would have five times the four which again equals in this case twenty like we just did this on the previous problem yes so we have five times four which equals twenty therefore this quantity here is going to equal one twentieth here the one-fourth because that's a quarter that the 1/4 is equal to five 20th yes and this is what we're basically earning so each one of those is one twentieth so each crate is going to weigh one twentieth ton and this is our statement showing our understanding here a lot of it we could check our work which we always do remember the quotient multiplied by the divisor going back to our five I'm sorry we didn't write our division statement should have been 1/4 divided by 5 we never did get that down so now our 1 xx multiplied by 5 is 5 over 2000 or in this case one quarter ton how many pounds does each great way I'm almost positive there are two thousand pounds and a quarter ton versal in this case we're taking one twentieth of a ton and we're going to multiply that by since there's two thousand pounds in each ton we're going to determine how much weight that is so if we have the one times two thousand up here and then that's gonna have the 20 down below now here's some common factors here I see a common factor of a 10 so if I were to or even with the two well that makes it even better if I were to divide a 20 out of 2,000 I could actually divide a 20 out so 20 divided by 20 is 1 so that leaves nothing here and if we divide a 20 out of the 2,000 you'll see that that's going to be 100 because 100 times 20 is 2,000 so we end up with an answer of that's it 100 pounds and that can be written like this as well so our statement here is that yet each crate weighs 100 pounds we just put that right here all right make him make a good progress let's keep it going okay here we go problem 5 it says they has 5 pieces of ribbon each one yard long she cuts each ribbon into 6 okay how many 6 will she have after cutting all the ribbons it says how long will each of the six be in inches okay take a look at this and how many taxes big I think I might want to really make sure that I use my read draw and write really focus on the reading here so 5 pieces of ribbon each one yard long ok so we have 5 yards trying to get a better understanding here she cuts each ribbon into 6 okay so I think rather than me trying to make some kind of hole as my 5 I like the one yard you here I think what I will wrap would do to solve this problem is I would do this I think I would go ahead and show this as my 1-yard I am going to divide it into six so I'm gonna go ahead and wrong one start a line here okay so this is gonna go right in the middle let me do the rest of them okay so I have my six my sixth here so I've taken one of the ribbons here and cut them into six so now my problem my division statement will say one hole here divided by and we're trying to figure out what is in the value of one six because we have six equal pieces here well there's six six in one yard okay so that's definitely in one yard and that would mean then there would be how many six and I'm just writing this down so do you think in five yards let me abbreviate that well yeah six times there's five of them then that means there's going to be 30 so there's 36 in five yards the PHA will have 36 after cutting all the ribbons let me go ahead and write that so let's put that on PHA will have 36 after cutting all the ribbons and we're not quite done because there is a part be the part be says how long will each of the six be in inches this is based on yards and we know that there were six six in one yard so one whole divided into divided into six one six that would mean that this would equal six can we check our work six times right our one six is six over six which is equal to one and it gets us back and we determine that six six in one yard and in this one hole and then we multiplied now we need to convert in two inches well again this unit you have to have pretty much memorized most people know there's twelve inches in one foot there's three feet in one yard we could just go straight to how many inches are there in in a yard one-sixth of a yard times 36 inches and 36 inches then that's going to be 36 over six and you can see we have a common write factor which is just 36 divided by six so we end up with six inches that seemed reasonable on five yards 36 times five is going to be 30 15 that's a hundred and eighty inches so if we had six inches in one so we could take the six inches times 36 times 30 is 180 inches so our numbers match up so we are good to go a glass pitcher is filled with water okay straight straight forward 1/8 of the water is poured equally into two glasses so we don't know how much water is in the pitcher do we we don't all we know is that one eighth of the water is poured equally into two glasses so first thing is what fraction of the water is in each glass this is kind of like our step one well if we have one eighth of the waters poured equally into two glasses what we're saying is this is kind of like our dividend one eighth of the water we have 1/8 whatever that amount of water is it's poured equally into glasses if we were to take we could say that since there's two glasses let's say that that 1/8 is going to get split in two so if we have here I've said I wasn't going to draw a picture but just kind of think here's your glass and you have another one here okay so that 1/8 that's going to be split where some of its going to come in this one and then the sum is going to come in the other so this is basically what we're saying is we need to find out what 1/2 is then of the 1/8 of water and that's pretty simple right 1/16 so 1/16 of the water will go into each glass so 1/16 of the water will let say 1/16 of the water is let's write this what is in is in each glass that's as if each class has three fluid ounces of water in it how many fluid ounces of water were in the full picture if if three fluid ounces of water is in each glass right now that would mean that 1/16 because that's what the fraction was it means that 1/16 is equal to 3 ounces yeah and that also means then since there were two glasses were the two glasses together that would mean that 1/8 is one of three ounces times the two glasses in each we end up with 6 ounces and that means that in our unit here of 1/8 that 1/8 of the water from that pitcher is equal to 6 ounces now that's our 1 unit well how many more eighths would we need to make that whole we need seven more eighths right so we could take the six ounces then and we could multiply that six ounces with the number of units we have which is 8 now we end up with 48 ounces so 6 ounces by the 8 units is 48 ounces so we can say there are 48 fluid ounces in the full pitcher and let's write that down there are 48 of fluid ounces in the full picture great we still have another now it says if 1/4 of the remaining water is poured out of the pitcher to water a plant how many cups of water are left in the pitcher so could we show it this way the whole picture itself would have 48 fluence ounces in there we determine the six ounces were removed so we could say that in the picture right now is 14 ounces - those six ounces that were put into the two glasses now we have 42 ounces all right I hope I have everybody with me and what we're trying to find out it says if one quarter of the remaining water is poured out if if 1/4 of the remaining water is poured out of the picture to water a plan how many cups of water are left in the pitcher well let's just figure out Alex's right now don't let's not worry about the cups that's another unit so 1/4 of the remaining is pulled poured out so what's left in the actual picture that would mean 3/4 would be 3/4 of 42 did that make sense so 3/4 of 42 of course means 3/4 times 42 ounces over 4 we probably have some common factors here what do we have here 442 12 11 10 and divide that by 2 we get to divide that by 2 we get 21 now we have 21 times 3 which is 63 we have that over 2 you can rewrite that as a mixed number and that would be what 31 and then we're gonna have one left over and then we have our 2 that's what's gonna get left inside the pitcher we need to change this into cups well we know how many Ounces are in a cup last I checked I believe it was 8 so we have 31 and a half ounces I'll just put a Z it's equal to and we're trying to figure out how many cups basically what our goal is here here if there's 8 ounces in each cup we could rewrite this problem as 31 and 1/2 ounces okay multiply it by 1 over 8 because there's 8 ounces and it's kind of a way of dividing here this would be for the cups and then this will let us know how many cups we'll end up in the end this is to convert any ounces to cups now we could multiply use the distributive property 31 times 1/8 and then also multiply the 1/2 part with the 1/8 and that would equal again so many cups now we have 31 over 8 then we're going to have plus and this is going to be 1/16 and again this is going to give us our ultimate answer so this will be 62 over 16 when we get that common denominator plus 1/16 it's going to equal 63 over 16 and that's going to equal if we divide that note we're looking at 816 is going to go into 3 times we see 48 and 63 minus 48 this be 15 15 over 16 cups now that might have been pretty challenging for a fifth grader anyway trying to give it be an easier way so I wonder if there's an easier way to show this if there's 8 ounces in one cup then we would want to take the 31 and divide it by 8 which we can't quite do what could we do we could find the number that's close 32 is close that would be one additional ounce but what if we went backwards like 24 would be the closest so let's take 24 divided by 8 remember 24 ounces R divided by 8 because there's 8 ounces in one cup that's 3 cups and we still have 7 ounces left over okay we have 7 ounces left over and a half almost enough now this is almost 8 so we have 7 and 1/2 ounces we need to know how many cups that's going to make we have 3 full cups if we just head in 1/2 ounce more looking at that how could I convert that 7 half ounces into cups tub we would end up having to do something like taking 14 making that 15 halves fifteen halves is how many ounces we have and we want to divide that by eight yeah this is gonna be tough because we haven't done this before and it's going to equal a certain amount okay I think this may be a little bit challenging here there's a lot of steps here involved I mean if we didn't have a mixed number the numbers a little bit friendlier obviously 32 would have been a much would've been a better number would give us exactly 4 cups but they made the problem a little more challenging what can I say it's Eureka again", "zokTJNk4a4k": "hello 5th graders welcome to lesson 9.1 line plots please pause to write the lesson number and title in your notebook today's lesson objective is to make and use line plots with fractions to solve problems please pause again to write the lesson objective in your notebook alright fifth graders let's begin today's lesson by reading the unlock the problem it says students have measured different amounts of water in two beakers for an experiment the amount of water in each beaker is listed below and you can see we have a list of data 1/4 1/4 1/2 3/4 1 fourths so on underneath we have a question if the total amount of water stayed the same what would the average amount of water in a beaker be so the average would mean about the middle so in order to find the middle of something we're gonna need to follow the steps on this page and create a graph of our data step 1 says count the number of cups for each amount draw an X for the number of times the amount is recorded to complete the blind plot so first off we have 1/4 so let's look at how many 1 fourths we have I'm gonna go ahead and circle that so I have one here and here and here so find everything that says one-fourth ok so it looks like we have one two three four five six seven one fourths okay now let's look at how many 1/2 so we have we have one two that's it we have two 1/2 and then 3/4 3/4 it looks like we have one two three okay now we're going to use this to continue the diagram the graph up in the top right corner so above the 1/4 you can see that they've started we have one two three four X's but we need seven I'm going to continue on four five six seven okay in the one half we have two so I'm gonna draw two and then above the three-fourths we have three and they've already drawn one so I'm gonna draw two more so my graph should looks like this remember if my graph looks like this your graph needs to look like this as well okay step two says find the total number of water and all the beakers that contain 1/4 cup of water well we know that there are seven beakers with 1/4 cup of water so that would mean that there are 7/4 so we could write that as 7 over 4 or we know that 4 goes into 7 one time with 3 leftover parts so we could write that as 1 and 1/4 so what we did is we added 1/4 plus 1/4 plus 1/4 plus 1/4 seven times or we could multiply 7 times 1/4 that's where we got that 7/4 let's go to step two and practice this skill again step two says find the total number of water in all the beakers that contain one half we counted two beakers that had one half so there are two halves and again we could write this as 2 times 1/2 which would give us 2 half or one cup step four says find the total number of water and all the beakers that contain 3/4 you had three of them so like I showed you that's three times 3/4 and remember we multiply straight across the bottom up so three times three is nine fourths and 4 goes into nine two times which is eight with one-fourth left over now step five says we want to take all of those totals that we found the one and three-fourths from step two the two halves from Step three the two and one-fourth from Step four and add them together so step five says add the total amounts so if we change 2 over 2 into a 1 then we have common denominators so let's add these numbers well if I add 3/4 and 1/4 that gives me one whole plus 2 plus the one that's there plus one more so that gives me 1 2 3 4 5 so the adding altogether I get the number 5 now in order to find the average that means about the middle we want to know what would be our total divided by the number of beakers that we had or the number of X's in our graph so we're going to do 5 divided by 12 and 12 doesn't go into 5 evenly so we can write this as a fraction 5 twelfths and that's as simple as that can get because 5 and 12 don't share anything and common so the average is 5 twelfths great job so far 5th graders let's continue on the example says rain divides three two ounce bags of rice into smaller bags the first bag is divided into bags weighing one-sixth ounce the second bag is divided into bags weighing 1/3 ounce and the third bag is divided into bags weighing 1/2 ounce then here's our question find the number of 1/6 1/3 and 1/2 ounces of bags graph your results on the line plot step 1 says we need to give our line plot a name so it says it should describe what we are counting well we are counting bags of rice and we are looking at ounces so we are going to write the weight of rice bags ok step 2 says we're going to label 1/6 1/3 and 1/2 on the plot line so that we know the different amounts so they did that for us 1/6 1/3 1/2 they're written on the line and now we're going to use some division to find the number of 1/6 1/3 and 1/2 bags they're made so that we can graph them so the first thing we have is 2 divided by 1/6 remember that we want to use the keep flip change method so 2 times 6 flip it upside down is 12 okay now the same thing with 2 times 1/3 if we take 1/3 and we flip it upside down 2 times 3 is 6 and lastly 2 divided by 1/2 so we keep flip change and that would change 1/2 into a 2 and 2 times 2 is 4 so now let's go ahead and add those X's to our line plot so I love the 1/6 the we have 12 X is so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 nine ten eleven twelve okay above the one-third we have six X's 1 2 3 4 5 6 and above the 1/2 we have 4 1 2 3 4 ok and now it says that we are going to open up horses draw your X's and we already did that so we are all done this one with this one we did not need to find average like we did an example 1 all right 5th graders if you look above the example there's a section that says try this we're going to use that try this section as our lesson activity today you can go ahead and do it on your lesson pages you do not need to write it in your math notebook it says you can use order of operations to find the average solve the problem as a series of expressions that use parentheses and brackets to separate them perform operations from inside the parenthesis to the outer brackets so you can see we have this long string of fractions and numbers that we have to deal with so if we look inside the brackets I see 7 times 1/4 plus 2 times 1/2 plus 3 times 3/4 divided by 12 so let's start by solving each operation inside the parentheses so first off 7 times 1/4 7 times 1 is 7 and then 4 goes on the bottom 2 times 1 is 2 and 2 over 2 equals 1 then 3 times 3 equals 9 and the bottom number stays the same 4 so now let's add all of our fractions together so if we had 7 plus 9 we get 16 fourths and 4 goes into 16 4 times Plus that whole number one that's in the middle that gives us 5 then we would say 5 divided by 12 and again this is from that first problem so what should be our fractional answer go ahead and fill this in and we'll talk about it at the teacher table great job 5th graders", "csH10VkBfxc": "everybody ran here in East garage thanks for joining us for another live video on facebook and youtube today we're going to go over mixture ratios were going to explain them i'm going to show you how you can get an exact and precise ratio using mixing cups it may sound simple but it is it should be but we're going to show you exactly how to use them and why you need them plus the report lids gonna show you a couple paint guns and masking station and we're going to explain why this truck is sitting behind me now as always if you have any questions don't be afraid to post them in the comment and in the comment section on facebook and youtube Scotty seized over here you can see them nice shirt Scott yes stand up for your fans I don't get a good luck let them breathe in and so if you have any questions or comments all you gotta do is post them Scott's gonna dance answer him if it's something i can answer here or demonstrate I'll take care of it so first thing if you're mixing paint that probably means gonna be pouring paint out of a gallon like this now we've all done it and what happened Jennifer with the paint all around the lip you end up with a mess everywhere well you might want to go to eastwood and check out these port lids jewelry in here on it good alright so real simple just take the lid push it down on it seals tight and now when you want to pour you a poor out of here to set it back down it's sealed backup you don't have any mess at all in fact we even have them for courts to so no matter what size can you're using are going to portland for that's something that makes it makes a really nice when you're mixing paint so speaking of mixing paint let's get into mix ratio this jump right into it so i'm using this gallon jug because it's easy for demonstration purposes because it's going to be really easy to say we've got pints and quarts we got about all sizes you're going to need if you visit Eastwood we sell them kids and everything alive you're going to use in courts and we sell them as well so let's get right into it now these mixing cups are have about every ratio you want and we if we can get we're going to cut in here ok so there's a 211 three two one two one now that means say three to 11 which is what we're going to be using that simply means three parts paint one part activator one part reducer now if you're not using a reducer you can totally forget about this and you just use 2321 column and it and has four to 12 15 6 and 8 and around here is is just your standard measurements announces and milliliters to say want to mix 96 ounces and say you have one-to-one ratio you just pour up to 48 and then add your activator up here 296 now it's something beyond that you can use one of the charts i just showed you so job in june first I'll show you what we're gonna be mixing if we cut to jail here so what we're going to be doing today is we're going to be mixing it in eastwood single-stage everything which is a three-to-one ratio which is three parts paint one part activator now some people going to want to add a reducer so that's how you end up with your 3 2121 because you would add this also at one part so that's what we're going to do we're going to three parts paint one part activator and we're also going to reduce her to show you three two one to one ratio and now if we come back here to our to our large mixing Cup now say i decided i want to mix about 96 ounces so what I do is ok I take the 96 ounces right here and i would spin around the cup until I come to my 3211 right so 96 ounces puts me right there now you can see where that's at it's somewhere between this two in this three and my good here ok now somewhere between the two and three now remember these numbers here are not units of volume they're not units of measurement it just helps with the ratio so don't think yeah we're going to mix about 96 ounces we're not mixing exactly 96 ounces and these cups are just going to help with the ratio so we're mixing try not don't think that we're mixing you know like 30 ounces of this 1010 we're just going for about ninety six so we can mix a little more and use this and use this 3 or we can mix a little less and use this to now the 96 plus a little closer to the two so I'm going to mix a little less and use this to so what that means is the reason of all the way over here into this column is because i'm using three things so by the time I add the reducer I want to be over here so i would add the paint at the activator and the reducer so the final tally I want to be right about here which puts us at this too so the first thing I would do is I'm going to add i want to add the paint to the first two so this too is just the columns that we're going to use now all you to the first two then I'll add the activator which goes from there to there then we had the reducer from there to there so remember it's a 3 2121 so the first one is three parts and this ratio is just one-third of this ratio and this ratio again is just one-third 3 2121 if we want to mix more you would just use one of the other ones so we can get so now you may ask why you want to do this over just cups it's because it's very accurate or mixing stick a lot of times you use a mixing stick and what happens is is that the cups your bucket of your mixing in it may be tapered like this so if you're using a stick that has a measurements on it's based on a perfect cylinder so when you stick it in it it doesn't know it gets bigger so your ratio is going to be way off because cup grows it's not an accurate it's not actually won't be an accurate ratio anymore because the cups bigger and the sticks based on it being a perfect cylinder where these come in it's all that mass already done for you you're gonna get a perfect ratio every time because it's built into the bucket so the first thing we're going to do here if we cut back if we can come back to this close-up of the bucket is i'm going to add the peat up to the first two because again we're mixing three two one two one two you see I'm getting close so as you can see right here i'm in the three column and i'm using the tools because i want to end up here after i add all three parts the paint the activator and the reducer I want to end up there so my first one was three parts paint so I went to that too I'm gonna go to the next to with with the activator so now i'm going to have the activator up to that too so now you can see so now we have the now we have the paint and we have the activator so if that's all we needed if we were only using a three-to-one ratio if we if we only needed the paint and the activator we'd be done we can mix this up and we can go paint but because we also need a reducer we're going to go to right there so now we add the reducer and there we go we have a perfect three two one to one ratio of paint activator and reducer so before we get into a before we get into the paint guns and some other stuff around here Scott you have any questions or how we make it out here so far you've been explaining it really well you knocked it out of the park and thank you susan I've been practicing practices for about three weeks you can tell so help so I'm so anyways let's check let's check out the check out the paint guns um if you're looking for getting started to painting or if you're just looking for another gun spray some bass clear you want to check out this concourse LT a nice gun great price comes with 1.3 needle nozzle so it's good for spraying your bases and clears you cannot get other needle novels from eastwood if you want to spray your primers ah but over here checking out you get in here the coup de Gras the conch force pro two gun set really nice set I actually have this gun spray is really nice the kit comes with a regular gun and a detailed gun which is really nice to have hard-to-reach areas the detail cock gun comes with a one-point O'Neill nozzle and the concourse Pro comes with a 13 or 17 and a 20 so you're going to be all the spray everything from your primers all the way up to your base and clear codes so this kit is going to lie to pretty much spray everything you need on your car plus it comes with a regulator and it comes with your cups and right here in this box is cleaning kit and your gun wrench so if you're looking for your first your first HVLP pink onset this is a great set and if you're just looking to upgrade again it's a great set because it's got everything you need to spray from base to clear and primers so now that we got through that let's check out Oh check out i'm asking station so after already was set up i rise I should have I should have thrown a tip that you guys but I kind of ran out of time because we're scheduled to go live at three if you've never seen one of these masking trees masking stations the really nice we sell smaller version and if you're watching this live you might want to go to eastwood.com and check out our daily deal because every day we pick out a product we give you ten percent off and free shipping on a product so if you go to use with dot com take apart your daily schedule in the morning you don't check it out and see what products we have and I believe today we have a small masking station which holds one size paper it's like a store it's it's it's it's pretty nice and i think that might be our daily do today so if you're watching this live today only don't try calling in three weeks from now and telling our customer service department I told you get a great deal and then you gotta do it today but anyways well it works is it automatically puts on the tape so the masking tapes here the papers here so you pull out what you need and you rip it off and the reason i said i remember this was because a lot of times if i was going to paint the first thing i would do is i drip off a few feet of that and i would put it down here wherever i'm working so i put down one row of this one working because it's really nice to work on if you're mixing paint everything else because if you spill when you're done you just ball it up and you throw it away and it keeps your workstation nice and clean for the next time so one last thing all you people you probably want to know what this truck is behind me the truck behind me just arrived i believe its a 50 Chevy if somebody out there really knows their trucks and tells me to 51 I'm like believe you but the reason is here Andy whatever product engineers have seen them in some videos from our wedding videos he does gotta be brought in we push it into the garage today but tomorrow we're pushing it outside we're going to strip it with a contour SCT new product brand new Eastwood exclusive and incredibly popular if you would have saw Empire fabrication posted on Facebook them using it couple weeks ago 640 650,000 views about 1,200 comments so it's a really popular product and tomorrow want to strip this and you're going to get to see it live maybe for a while maybe a few times I don't know exactly what time we're going to go live at but make sure you check out eastwood.com make sure you subscribe to our YouTube channel and make sure you follow us on Facebook so when we go live going to see it in action so Andy and ryan we've also seen a lot of videos they're going to be taking turns stripping this whole thing the plan is to strip this entire truck tomorrow is gonna be a beautiful day here in pottstown so if you want to see it live for a little bit see this in action make sure you check us out tomorrow on youtube facebook or just visiting with dot com will be a banner there should be a banner there well let you know where the videos at well are there any other questions I did a good job today did awesome thanks a lot Scott so make sure you get it you tuning this week we've got live videos three live videos next week we're coming out your monday morning tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning so our schedule a little differently next week with thanksgiving so yeah so just make sure you follow us and subscribe to us and check us out next week and don't forget to go to eastwood.com for daily deal to get your mixing cups and make your you're painting a lot easier well take care see you next week actually maybe i'll see you tomorrow", "KrM5U2kGQCc": "hi I'm Roy Huntington editor of American handgun ER magazine a lot of my readers are really concerned about self defense and home protection basically defending their families of course in these crazy times I think it's wise to at least be thinking about those things a lot of people have bought a short-barreled defensive shotguns lately in order to defend their home a lot of my readers asked should I buy buckshot should I buy slugs should I buy birdshot I'm just really confused can you help me now keep in mind this isn't a comprehensive training video about how to effectively deploy a shotgun in a combat situation all I want to do is give you just a real quick look at the basic differences between buckshot which in this case is nine pellets about 32 or 33 caliber my left hand I have a typical two and three-quarter inch number eight shot 12-gauge something that you would go dove hunting with now which one is most effective in your home defense shotgun a few things you need to keep in mind buckshot will penetrate just like you were shooting a 380 automatic or a nine-millimeter it'll penetrate multiple walls inside of your house more than likely now if you live alone and out in the woods then that may not be a problem but if you have family members in the house or neighbors who are close by over penetration is a serious problem and something you need to think about and that's maybe where birdshot is a good option birdshot since it's very small bb's tend to under penetrate now that doesn't mean they're ineffective against an unprotected bad guy we actually took buckshot and took number eight shot and shot it at a target that was about five yards away what I want you to pay attention to is the fact that at close range they're virtually equally effective now granted you can argue that the buckshot may be more effective because it'll penetrate better and I won't argue the point with you but if you're concerned about over penetration you're concerned about other family members in the house being armed with 12-gauge shotgun loaded with number eight birdshot will absolutely protect you and your family okay we made these two shots at about five yards and this is an old Remington 870 police trading shotgun and it's got a cylinder bore so there's essentially no choke whatsoever it's pretty short barreled and it's pretty typical of a lot of the home defense type shotguns that you buy nowadays made by Remington or mosburger but not only anybody like that well we've learned here is we have number eight birdshot here and then we have double-aught buckshot over here what I'm trying to show you here is the fact that at five yards which is essentially across the room if you're using this as a defensive shotgun this is actually very significant and you'll see the majority of the shot are clustered right in here and this is what's called a rathole effect wound this is where a large portion of the shot actually went through causing a very significant wound over here of course you have the 32 33 caliber pellets that have spread out in a little bit of a distance this may be more effective for you because it does cover a larger area and at these distances both would be very lethal and would more than likely stop any threat that you had so if you have a sporting shotgun there's certainly nothing wrong I feel to use birdshot of some kind at close range home defense situations the additional advantage of that is the fact that the birdshot generally won't over penetrate and won't pass through two or three walls the buckshot being solid lead 32 or 33 caliber projectile tends to really penetrate and that could endanger neighbors or family members in other rooms so you need to think about this personally and do a little experimenting likely we did here with your shotgun just to see what kind of patterns but make a wise decision always be safe to be sure of your target make sure you have a light if possible get some training all we wanted to do is just give you something to think about here i'm roy huntington

my special recipe for real crab\ncake burgers it's got a really nice golden crust on the outside. let's make\nit! I'd like to share my special way of making real crab cake burgers, first of\nall we're going to take one beaten egg into a bowl, tablespoon of mayonnaise, quarter teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce.\nTryi and say that twice! A tablespoon of chopped red pepper and I've got some\njalapeno and it calls for two teaspoons but I put a tablespoon in because I like\nit, some salt, some pepper and some baking powder. In we go, I'm just gonna mix this\nup a little bit. I've got 1/4 cup of extra old cheese and now I'm going to fold\nin 8 ounces of real crab meat. These are big 4 ounce burgers. This is\ndelicious! See how that's incorporated, okay so my\nspecialty of doing this is I'm into the burger press here and you take a little\npiece of wax paper put it on the bottom and you put some crushed pork rinds in\nthe bottom like this, just in the bottom, if you don't have a burger press you can\nmake you can make your crab cakes and then just press it into that, that would\nbe fine too. So I'm going to split this down the center like that for half and half\nin it goes, most of it went in. and then... I'm going to put a little bit\nmore pork rind on the top like that, it's finely crushed that's what makes it\nreally crispy. I'm gonna add another piece of wax paper or parchment's fine\nand then I'm just going to push this down like this, just like that. Then you pop it\nout and now you've got a really nice crab cake burger. I'll make up the other\none. Okay I've got my pan preheated to a medium heat and I'm going to be cooking\nwith avocado oil today and I'll probably put about oh geez a good tablespoon\nin there and now we've got these perfectly formed burgers. We just peel\noff the outside like this. Okay so that's been about five minutes, I'm going to go\nin for the flip now and we just want to go till it's a nice golden brown. That looks good.\nThis one here.. that looks really good. That's nice and golden brown and we're\ngoing to let it go for another five minutes. These firmed up really nicely, a\ngolden-brown crust and that's due to the fine pork rinds on the outside fried in\nthe oil. I'm going to lift this out, what we want to do is we want to firm it up. I'm\ngoing to put this on the rack like this and we want it to set, I'd let it set for\nlike a good five minutes. mmm doesn't that look good and I'd serve\nthis with a spicy aioli which would be mayonnaise, a crushed garlic and a little\nbit of cayenne pepper and some lemon juice.. fresh lemon juice, mix it all up\nand you put it in the fridge for probably about two hours to let the\nflavors meld. I'll put the recipe for aioli in the notes below along with this.\nThanks for watching!", "cUh-c4H3gg8": "-Cheesecake is a classic dessert. While it's delicious plain, cheesecake is\na culinary bland canvass that can be easily dressed up with a variety of stir-ins and\ntoppers. This unique recipe has a crunchy nut crust\nand a traditional cream cheese filling. Your family is sure to love it. First, let's preheat the oven to 350 degrees,\nthen make the crust. Pour 1 and three-quarter cups of crushed graham\ncrackers into a medium bowl. You can buy them like this or make your own\nin a food processor. Crushed cookies also make delicious crusts. You can substitute crushed ginger snaps, vanilla\nwafers, or chocolate sandwich cookies. Next, add a quarter cup of finely chopped\nalmonds to the bowel. You can also use finely chopped pecans, walnuts,\nor macadamia nuts instead. Add 1 tablespoon of sugar. And if you like, go ahead and add half a teaspoon\nof ground cinnamon. Other spices that would make a tasty crust\nvariation are all spice, ginger, apple pie spice, or pumpkin pie spice. Stir the crust ingredients then pour in half\na cup of melted butter and mix well. If you're making a cookie crust variation,\nyou may need less melted butter, so add it gradually. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom and\nabout 1-1/2 inches up the sides of a 9-inch springform pan Because we're going to bake\nthe cheesecake in a waterbath, let's place the springform pan on a double layer of large\nheavy duty aluminum foil. Bring the edges of the foil up and mold it\naround the sides of the pan to form a watertight seal. The waterbath baking method is recommended\nsince it yields a creamier texture without the top cracking. Now, let's make the filling. Crack 3 eggs into a small bowl. Beat them lightly and set them aside. Add two 8-ounce packages of softened cream\ncheese to a large mixing bowl and add one 8-ounce container of sour cream. Add 1 cup of granulated sugar. Now, add 2 tablespoons of flour and 1 teaspoon\nof vanilla extract. Use an electric mixer to beat the filling\nand to look smooth. Keep scraping down the sides of the bowl and\nthen mix again until it's fully blended  then add the eggs. Gently stir the eggs into the beaten cream\ncheese to prevent aerating the eggs and batter. This prevents the cheesecake from puffing\nup in the oven and falling in the center upon cooling. While we'll make a classic cheesecake here,\nat this point, you can gently stir in an added ingredient to make a specialty cheesecake. Try a cup of chocolate pieces or a cup of\nfresh berries. Pour the filling into the prepared springform\npan. Now, it's time to bake. Place the springform pan into a shallow roasting\npan and place the pan into the oven. Then pour enough hot water into the roasting\npan to reach halfway up the sides of the springform pan. Bake it for 1 hour. You'll know the cheesecake is done when the\ncheesecake edges jiggles slightly then turn the oven off and allow the cheesecake to sit\nin the oven for 1 hour to allow it to set then remove the springform pan from the waterbath. Place it on a wire rack. Allow it to cool for 15 minutes. Use a small knife to loosen the crust from\nthe sides of the pan and cool the cheesecake for another 30 minutes. Remove the sides and allow the cheesecake\nto cool completely on the rack. Cover the cheesecake and chill it for at least\n4 hours before serving. Cheesecakes and dessert sauces are a match\nmade in heaven. So, it's worth planning to make a sauce too. There's a delicious recipe for homemade fudge\nsauce at bhg.com. Yum!", "QDCZiebfXdA": "hi everyone it's stephanie from scrap and create and i'm here today to share with you my finished eight and a half by eight and a half minneapolis collection from graphic 45 i just completed this today i'm very excited so i'm going to walk through and share some of the features with you and if you click in the description if you go to the description and hit the show more button there'll be a material list and a cut list and also all of the tutorials are now available for this album so i'll start by sharing the cover so on the cover i featured graphic 45 roses i'll also a piece of graphic 45 hardware and these small pearls that you see featured here are also graphic 45 and they'll all be available in the material list if you guys want to take a look so i used a large ephemeral journaling card and a smaller ephemera journaling card to feature on the front very beautiful and then here's the side i like the way that turned out and then in the back i featured one of the the new laser-cut die pack that they have that sort of replaced the tags and pockets so these are really interesting the textures a little bit heavy it's somewhere between what the tags and pockets felt like and a sticker but there's no adhesive on the back but i like them i'm still trying to figure out how to utilize them in my projects but i think they're gonna be really handy i added just some burlap colored twine here to just fill out the floral sprays that i've added okay on the inside i've got this nice deep accordion fold i'm gonna tip it a little so you can see it there's an accordion fold here pocket so that it's nice expandable and then inside i've got a couple of cards they can add journaling notes too and also photos on the inside so you can put two 4x6 photos plus the journaling space on the outside and it's expandable so you could get a lot inside this pocket this is one of the stickers i featured here and i just paperback fussy cut just so it'll pop a little bit more this is actually from signature page on the front it had these four squares that were sort of inset so I cut those out and then just matted them to use as a feature here this is from the 12 by 12 collection pack this is from patterns and solids 12 by collection pack 12 by 12 collection pack patterns and solids inside I've got two tags so I've got these small ephemera journaling cards ones a bifold ones a trifold there you go and then I've got these two tags so these are the large tags which I had to take an inch and a half off the bottom because this is only eight and a half by eight and a half and these tags are actually quite large and then I use the graphic 45 a die to map these and then you'll see there's two charms that are featured at the top and if you buy the collection from us will include coordinating charms and it may or may not be these depending on how supplies last but they'll definitely coordinate with the collection I left this blank so you could feature another photo here this is a magnet closure and then down here is a small cut apart or a sticker that I just paperback so you've got a little tuck spot so that is page one got a nice large photo mat and as you can see the scale is different this is from the 8 8 by 8 collection pack and so is this blue strip and that's just black on the on the reverse side that's peach one here we go on page 2 page 2 is just a simple waterfall feature this is part of the cut apart on the front signature page of the 12 by 12 collection pack they had two horizontal and two vertical and I use all of them in the in this album and this is just a simple waterfall feature here we go okay and I just add a couple of stickers here and there just to make it a little interesting page three this flaps up and this is a large ephemera card here this is from the 12 by 12 collection pack this is from the 12 by 12 collection pack and then back here is patterns this was a patterns and solids and this is one of those four pieces that I said we're on the signature page this is just paperback sticker and then it opens this way another paperback sticker and then lastly it opens this way and this is one of the die-cuts so again they're really pretty I think I'm going really gonna like them I've just got to get kind of used to how to use them this is from the 8x8 collection pack so it's the smaller print and then this is patterns and solids okay here we go again 8x8 collection packets the smaller scale and if you look again at the front you can tell here are the two horizontal cut aparts that came from the signature page and these both open out and then you've got this pocket that holds these ephemera cards and journaling cards so there's room for photos and some journaling and both of these open up for more photos there you go and these are held together by a magnet closure as well this is from pattern the 8 by 8 collection this is from the 12 by 12 collection pack and this is the other horizontal flap that I caught from the signature page back here you'll see 12 by 12 patterns and solids and I did essentially the same thing so these are two pieces that are covering each one of the flaps and then I alternated blue and polka dots going across this is one of the cut aparts from the I believe it's from the 8x8 collection pack another large ephemera a paperback sticker one of the cutter parts from the signature page a sticker that's paper backed to touch it actually that's one of the die-cuts the stickers are a little bit smoother and this is one of the die-cuts up here as well and I left these items I think I left it open-ended yeah well I guess I didn't that one's completely glued down but usually I'll leave it open in that just in case you want to Snug your picture right up in there this is from the 12 by 12 collection pack it's the larger format larger scale okay this is from the 8 by 8 collection pack and it's just black on the back side and then here we've got a repeat of the design that we had on page 1 or we've got these 2 ephemera journaling card packs and then also two of the graphic 45 dies and I just love this little unicorn charm and then here we've got a sailboat which kind of goes with although it shows a ship it does have sails so we'll do our best to coordinate charms while supplies last these are two of the stickers that have been paperback that's a sticker as well this is from the sticker collection and then this opens up and these are both from that new die-cut packet that replaced the tags and pockets so I'm really liking these I think I'm going to once I get used to them get get a better idea how to feature some of them I have quite a few left and they work really well in terms of scale for cards and then another expanding pocket with more journaling ephemera cards so lots of storage you can put lots of memorabilia cards anything from the event inside here and then there's the back again and that is the dreamland mini album thanks everybody for being so patient it took me a while to get this out and as you probably heard or will hear in some of my tutorials kind of got the house torn up we've got some stuff going on here so it's been really hard to videotape without all the noise in the background so anyways I hope you enjoyed this everybody have a great day thanks for tuning in if you're new to the channel please take a moment to subscribe like and share we really appreciate it and also if you're new what I've done at the end of the videos now is I've got this little rolling commentary section that talks about where to find the cutlass materialist and how to access our playlists for the tutorials of any given project so take a minute to at least get to the end of one of our videos so that you can see that description and it'll really save you some times in term in terms of locating videos in the future so thanks again for tuning in everybody this is Daphne from scrap and create my next mini-album coming up is going to be life is a journey so that's what's coming up next so thanks thanks again everybody have a great day", "BXNjq7m3klg": "hi everyone its Daphne from scrap and creating today we are going to get started on the dreamland mini album and this mini album is based on the eight and a half by eight and a half base album size which there'll be a tutorial for as part of this playlist but that's where I'm gonna start I'm not actually going to build eight and a half by eight and half right now I'm gonna go ahead and jump ahead and start laying in the pieces that make it Dream Land specific but there will be like I said the eight and a half by eight and a half face will be part of this tutorial playlist so like I said we're gonna start with this dreamland collection and then here's my eight and a half by eight and a half that I have built and I have my hinges in and the first elements we're going to work on are going to be the inside front and back liners I've built what I call in the core daeun style pocket so it's an expanding pocket and we're gonna get started by putting that together right now and we're going to get those on the front and back so let's get started with the measurements so what you're going to need and you're gonna need two of these one for the front one for the back is eleven by six eleven by six so that's 11 inches I'm sorry by six-and-a-half eleven by six and a half and you're gonna score at half inch one inch one and a half inches then come across to the other side you can either rotate it and do half inch one inch one and a half inches or leave it in your scoreboard the way it is do these first three scores then come across to nine and a half ten and ten and a half on the 11 inch side so you're gonna wind up with these peaks and valleys on either side which are going to be the expanding part of the pocket now once you've got those score lines in rotate this forty degrees and do a half inch score line across the six and a half inch side so when you're done you're going to have an eight by six pocket that's going to go on your inside so once you've done all that I want you to fold your accordions straighten them out and then fold this piece and then come back put your accordions in and you're gonna trim at an angle so that you're trimming off these edges on the bottom and then once you do that you're going to have to open it up and trim off a little bit more on the accordion size just a little bit because I really want these two to meet to help hold this in place it's not necessary but I think it'll make it stay together a little bit better and I've done one ahead of time and so you can see these because of the overlap I was able to run my tape right over the edges and they're staying together that bottom flap isn't loose on its own so like I said it's not necessary but I think it'll make a little bit more tidy so once you've done that you made sure that you've trimmed off all your excess on both of these sides and the bottom and then you want to check that it folds over and nothing is interfering and that everything is hidden on this side okay then we're gonna go ahead and run some tape around the edges like I've done here and this is our first accordion pocket that's gonna get laid down right here the second one that's gonna go here and then for the top piece and again you'll need two of these mmm this is four and a half by eight so that's four and a half by eight you're gonna score a half-inch and you get two of those and those will be the top of the two pockets okay so I said we have one for each side there we go actually I could put this over here this is all my measurements and as usual if you click in the more description scroll down you'll see the cut list for this as well so it'll tell you what the size of the papers are as well as where to score okay look that I'm gonna go ahead and sit down I've been standing I'm going to sit down and I'm gonna double check a couple of things so yeah so this is 8 inches wide so basically I want this pocket to look square on the page and then as you know this an eight and a half by eight and a half so that means this flop is eight and a half inches and so this is going to be eight inches so I just need to inset it about a half an inch all the way around and then we'll have a perfect square that sits inside the front cover okay and I just realized I'm gonna have to trim out some more paper so I'm gonna go ahead and get this one laid down since I already have the tape on it and then together we'll put the tape on this one and lay it down okay I'm just eyeballing it so I'm looking for even border on both sides so one of the tricky parts about laying this down is making sure you're holding your accordion together so that it doesn't want to scoot to the outside and go in a little bit crooked so you shouldn't see any of the accordion when it's in until you pull up on it okay so that's in so now we're gonna put the flap in and it's gonna go in on the top and I'm gonna rotate it around and it's gonna go in right about here so now for this effort I'm lining it up off the bottom piece and then again I'm looking for the border and they know it's very hard to see in here right now black-on-black always is so I'm looking for this border here to be the same distance as we see down here and I'm just doing this visually but I am gonna use my what I call my tape tear tool just to make sure that the edge of the paper is flush with you with this edge down here meaning not not go off at an angle okay that's a little too high all right it's gonna be a little bit fussy but we can do it this is an ideal spot to put a decorative edge on here I'm not going to do that I don't think I think I'm going to keep it square but you could easily round the corners here just for some added interest okay I'm going to get one side down as my pivot point there we go and there's our pocket okay it's so the lat oh I came in here without my magnet so I have to go back and get my magnets in a minute so the last thing we're gonna do is put a magnet here to keep this closed but first let's go ahead and get started with this piece okay so like I said we're going to on the the score line farthest from the edge you're gonna fold down then back and then down again so you wind up with I don't know if you want to call it an M or a W and you're gonna do that on the other side and then we're gonna tuck them down and then I'm gonna use just a dot of glue right there to hold the bottom of the pocket to the accordion fold I'm just gonna press that in place and that's just enough to hold it together while I get my tape on hopefully I might not have put enough glue if it wants to push hard because the accordion wants to pop it out okay that looks okay oh my gosh I guess I got in here without my tape I'll be right back all right I've got my tape now all right let's get our second pocket in okay that's in pressing everything into place and now we'll get the flap put it in and you'll see this is a nice deep thick pocket so we'll be able to get lots of memorabilia and ephemera into this pocket which is nice [Applause] very good in looking at this I think this one's a little bit high but I'm not sure I'm gonna adjust it because you won't be able to see both of these at the same time because there's gonna be four pages in between so I don't think I'm going to I'm not gonna adjust it it's straight so I'm happy with that but you know another thing you can do is I just eyeballed it is you can put your reference line in part of the reason I do so much eyeballing is well I've got a pretty good eye for it these days but also to do all the measuring is much much slower and I know you guys can stop and start whenever you want and these videos are already so long I I want to just sort of keep rolling but you can feel free to stop and do a reference line just because I don't doesn't mean you don't have to so I'm just trying to get through my packet of magnets here it's just not wanting to come open for me it goes yeah we're making progress you got two pluses there we go all right so we're going to place one on the flap here and then one just below it may be fumbling sorry okay there we go and I just want to make sure that the mate is gonna come down low enough that it doesn't interfere with any of my offset here and that's gonna be fine all right and then we're going to put our tape on top to smooth out the edges very good okay so here's the first page that I'm going to place down here on the bottom this is from the 12 by 12 patterns and solids go ahead and use this contrast sheet on the top so I can see my top edges okay [Music] all right so I'm using a sixteenth inch border and what that means is for example for a four and a half by eight you're gonna go one eighth inch shorter and one eighth inch narrower and then you send to your mat and you'll have a sixteenth inch border so I don't give you the designer cut list but I will give you the base card stock and then you back off whatever you want your mat size to be mm-hmm all right so the next piece I've chosen is this this is also a twelve by twelve but this is from the collection pack and it's you know it's hard to tell which way is up but I think I got it right my party shirt [Applause] okay let's start them a few yes so now I have two little elements these are from the sticker pack and so I took the sticker and then I mounted it on black cardstock to stiffen it but also to make it pop because I want to see the edges stand out more and that is going to be a design element that I'm going to put right here on the edge in the center of this but before I do that I'm going to go ahead and line the backside of this so I'm going to turn this over and bring the paper to me now using the same paper once I cut these two panels out these are going to be identical I had some scraps left over so I'm using these scraps to cover the flip side and here's what I have the centerpiece and two edge pieces so it's gonna go like this so I can do this alternatively I could do this and have the patterns on the edges so it's really kind of a preference thing I'm not sure I think I kind of like this better so these strips are 3 and 7/8 3 and 7/8 because this is a 4 inch panel and this is 2 inches so these are 2 inches each and that just wound up being an easy way for me to split the scraps up so that I could use them on the back side of the panel you don't have to do that and 2 inches is an easy thing to trim down to without having to really fight my trimmer too much because once I get under 2 inches it gets hard to hold the paper study while you're trimming because it wants to pull sorry I'm just looking for orientation which way is up and I think that's it ok I think that I'm now correct but of course I had to turn it upside down because we're gonna put it in so I'm going to do the solid yellow piece in the middle and the two patterns on the outside edges now you can attach all three and then trimmed down to size but I'm actually planning on leaving a slight gap of black in between each one I do want to double-check my fit so right now I'm looking to make sure the yellow piece is the same height as at the decorator piece it is I'm looking on both sides and it is so after I get this piece in I'm going to measure this and then trim this down it looks like it needs to be a little bit narrower okay that looks good okay that looks good so take this tape off and we'll get I have to ink the edge I just trimmed just curious yeah its host curious if it was directional it is it's actually a little bit narrower then enter this white or white it's not square those having a hard time saying that okay so there's the inside I'm happy with that there's the outside of course we've got a magnet in there so I still need to do something for the liner and I haven't actually picked that out yet so I'm going to turn this over I'm gonna go ahead and add this little decorative piece so I don't lose it and of course I don't have a ruler here but I am gonna try to actually Center this so alright looks like that is my Center okay I know I want some of it to hang off those trendy decide how far so I'm using this little corner here as my reference and that'll be where the bottom glue line is there we go got a little heavy-handed on the glue there okay they're not happy with that okay and again I'll need to come back and pick out a liner for this I don't have that picked out yet and it actually might just set it aside and come back and do that later with scraps I have from something leftover rather than cut into a twelve by twelve just for this little sliver here okay now here we are onto this side same thing same elements which is not uncommon for me I like to start and stop start and end with you know symmetry and whoops I was gonna put that you guys were gonna let me put that down without a maggot alright that's done and then I need so where's my fat tape so it should be interesting next week starting tomorrow today's Sunday I don't know what I'm actually gonna get this uploaded but today while I'm recording at Sunday and then next week we're gonna start a remodel on a wonder of our bathroom so even though I'm gonna be doing some filming it's gonna be loud in the background but there's not much I can do about that it just doesn't turn out very well when I shoot at night mm-hmm okay so this just definitely has orientation so pay attention don't do what I did with my balloons on my last album and put them in upside down you know what I didn't dry fit this first and I think I need to I need to trim it so because we have these accordion folds this is it's gonna be very difficult for this to be a perfect eight inches across and I trimmed this based on eight inch and it's actually a little bit narrower so you may want to dry fit and trim before you put down your pieces it's like I said when you have multiple scores it's very difficult to you know estimate what the panel size needs to be ahead of time so hey we talked I don't know how it turned out that the first one to win and so easily without a dry fit but mmm just a heads up mmm so dry fit and if you if you measure it for eight inches you're gonna be okay if anything you'll need to trim off you won't be too short okay so that's in so let's go ahead and turn this over and then get this piece in and then I have to that's it okay I'm just double-checking my orientation making sure I don't put it in upside down and I should have done the same thing here's dry fit first although this doesn't have any side to side score lines but I do want it to look consistent with the panel below so I'm going to trim some okay so that is there that looks good okay let's go ahead and get this guy on so he's floating around I'm worried I'll lose him let's find my midpoint I thought these little stickers were so cute so cute okay now we're gonna do the inside same thing we're going to have a pattern on each side and then we're gonna put the yellow in the middle and I'm gonna rotate this so the paper is next to me and again these are scraps leftover from this term out and these are two inches wide all that noise about putting things in right and I put it in upside down [Music] all right that's in and then here is our paso yellow which we will need to trim down is it nope I guess it doesn't matter but I think this piece is a little bit smaller yeah this is the right one there we go okay let's get some ink on that [Music] all right okay like I said I'll come back and add a piece here later I'm thinking if I have some extra blues what I'm probably gonna want to lay down here but we'll see what's left over after I design some more of the other pages so that's it for our front and back inside liner so now I'm ready to set this book aside and as we move forward we'll be working on the individual pages and we'll work on those outside the book and then add them to the book later okay so thanks everybody for tuning in I hope you liked at least where we're headed here I'm pretty happy with the overall design thanks for tuning in to Stephanie from scrapping Cree", "iO3NnXbY7LY": "foreign you can you hear me let's let some people get in here um i did invite george but he uh but he has uh said he had a conflicting meeting so he might not make it but everyone that's here welcome william no i don't do uh boosting for hso boosting for cars anymore i quit doing that about five years ago well the truth is gas prices went way down so it forced a bunch of us out of business so i concentrated on some other areas looks like there's about a seven second delay between the camera and uh your comments that i before i can see them so it'll take me a bit to respond to him hi george okay so it's 9 35 so i'm gonna get going so a lot of you or a lot of people have been asking for an attachment for their browns gas machines to make the deuterium depleted water and i've come up with something that i just wanted to share with the community instead of trying to market it or sell it um what i will do is i'll put a list of materials in the bottom of this video so that you guys can go pick up all the parts and assemble these yourself at home not hard to do but it did take a while to figure out how to do it with these machines and i'm going to share that with you today but first i want to show you the concept of how it actually happens and how we can collect the uh deuterium depleted water um so so i've got uh here i've got one my browns gas machine here and then connected to it is a torch and the way that the water is created is inside the machine the electricity separates the water into hydrogen and oxygen that's where we get our gas and then it's pumped through the output port and into this torch and when you light it it it'll obviously burn and it's obviously flammable but something really cool happens when it is the flame comes in contact with with with metal or any material you can actually see how the hydrogen and oxygen recombine back into water and when it when it recombines back into water this is when it's it said it's the first time i lit a torch i was really amazed at the properties that the flame has but one thing i did notice is that uh it when you put it up against something you could see that water was being created i thought that was really cool but i didn't put two and two together until just last year i i didn't know anything about uh ddw uh until i started learning a little bit about it and then i put two and two together that uh it could you could create it by this process so i'm gonna show you uh how the water or how the hydrogen oxygen combine back together and form the water i've got a just a stainless steel plate here and i'm going to run the flame over it and show you how you can you'll be able to see the water forming on the plate so i'm going to go ahead and start up the machine get it going [Music] i'm not even really sure the stream is going anymore it's just uh it's just chugging over here oh there we go looks like it's got a real large delay now okay so so go ahead and light the flame it's really hard to see i don't even know if you'll even be able to see it there it's a little tiny flame now this machine is making about 400 to 500 milliliters per minute you can see it's not much of a flame but i'm going to see if i can get this on camera for you you can see now as i kind of touch the flame to that plate see that condensation there that's that's water you can see how it's the water is forming on the plate there there so what we want to do that that water there is pure and it's free of deterio mostly i'll explain later why it's not completely free but what we want to do is we want to we want to build a way to capture that water so that we can use the water and that's that's what i'm going to show you how to do any questions so far okay if i were to hold this torch to that plate long enough it would melt right through okay before we start building it let's talk a little bit about safety so this this technique is going to work on any bronze gas machine so whatever you've got it's going to work on but you're going to want to be safe so uh this flame the bronze gas flame has a perfect uh mixture of oxygen in it for for it to burn so if i were to light it here without this torch tip it would burn up through here all the way back to your hose into your machine and then when it hits an air pocket like here this is going to explode okay so what we do is we put a flash arrester in line so so when you quench this flame you'll always get a flashback so when i turn this off it'll flash back every time well most of the time not all the time when the flame is larger and you've got more more gas volume it'll definitely flash back so you're going to get a flashback every time you turn it off so we put a flash raster in line that flash comes through the line and stops at the arrester and i always recommend to have two safety measures so there's two flashback arresters in this system there's one inside if you're going to do this i'd run two of these in line just to be super safe because no one wants uh an explosion in their face so i'll put it bluntly okay yeah there's other ways of making deuterium depleted water this is one of the ways there's there's a better way to do it that most of the companies that are producing it are doing it but it costs a whole heck of a lot of money to set it up correctly this way can be done by just about anyone um the testing i got from simple lab here's the one test i did it was on a it was on a different uh setup but it came back at 44 ppm and uh i'll show you some ways that i think i can lower that number down that was uh pretty raw when i first sent it sent the sample out but uh i was a little disappointed in that i was hoping to get you know 25 or lower but it's a good place to start and another place i'm using let me get the kit here's a this is the one i'm going to use next time and i don't remember the name of the place all right let's see www.ddcenters.com and it's just a little kit here you measure out a little water in a vial and send it back to use a mass spectrometer to read how much deuterium deuterium's in the water i don't know what to do about the the freezing uh feed i'm doing this on my cell phone i don't have any of those the fancy cameras and that kind of thing but uh after this is done it'll be automatically uploaded so you can rewatch it i apologize okay so so what we're going to be building essentially looks like this it's a crazy setup but it works and i'm gonna show you how to do it so i've got the parts here all these things i got from home depot and you can use stainless steel fittings if you want so i've got a couple couplings a coupling an adapter a t and a couple nipples then i need some teflon tape and i've got a coil of 20 foot of copper quarter inch i try to use the stainless it's a little bit harder to work with but uh i suggest taking all these parts out and cleaning them thoroughly because once you start building the water through it's gonna pick up anything that's on the inside and just gonna you're gonna get it into your water and also um recommend after making some some ddw to distill it so you get any of the things out there you know in the lines and the copper lines okay so essentially what we're going to do is we're going to build a chamber that we can stick the torch tip into and we're going to seal the seal the top so the flame goes down inside and all the condensates collect and they run down the tube and as the the steam will be steamed there too as a steam going through the tube it'll condense on the walls of the tube and then form into water and we'll collect it at the bottom with a uh in some kind of container let me get all this stuff out of its packaging oh and also the the secret component that makes it work is this aquarium pump i spent a bunch of time trying to keep the flame lit with all these different configurations so i couldn't keep the flame lit until i added this to the system i'll show you how to use that i'm not an expert on frequencies so i'm not really sure i'm not actually not really sure that a frequency can be imprinted on a gas but it's it's possible i don't know how someone would verify that that was for john okay so what we're going to do is we're going to put these parts together i'm going to wrap these with teflon tape just a little bit of tape to seal it up okay wrap these two ends all right that's going to go in there this in here um this one down here and this over here that's going to complete the the chamber so this is where we're going to put our torch of course this torch just happened to fit in here really nice and we're going to put a little bit of teflon taper on this so we get a seal and then we're going to build our coil and attach it to here a condensing coil you're going to want to take these and we're going to want to tighten these down okay yeah okay so you always want to bubble your water that filters out some things some impurities and also to make the gas more more pure i guess for making deuterium depleted water uh you want to take out any moisture in the gas because any moisture in the gas could have deterium in it and then it ends up and ends up in your water so if you were to take and use a dryer and run your gas through a dryer this would dry the gas take out any moisture in the gas whatsoever so you just have pure hydrogen and oxygen this i think will lower the deuterium number greatly but i haven't i haven't sent in a sample yet which i'm going to be doing to see if that actually is true and inside of here this is just a water filter housing inside of it is desiccant beads that you can you can get those on ebay or amazon and that completely dries out the gas okay let's make our coil neat thing about these from home depot it comes already pre-coiled so if you don't want to coil it smaller you can just leave the coil big like that i'm going to make a smaller coil i'll show you how to do that so here i've got a six inch pipe i'm going to coil this around the pipe so i can make myself a six inch coil all right so let's just start the coil around if i'm lucky i'll get this all straight oops oh thanks for answering that question okay uh i don't know if i mentioned but this is a 20-foot coil so you're gonna need a pretty long coil because this thing heats up pretty good it takes a bunch of coils to cool it down but by the bottom of the coil it's cold and we're getting to the end here i could have probably coiled this a little tighter but trying to save a little time here okay okay there's our coil and we're going to need is another small coil let me cut this off so this is the tubing cutter get this at any home center in the plumbing department it makes a nice perfect cut all right so there's that coil now we're going to make another smaller coil to put the air into from the aquarium pump this is a four inch piece you could just coil it in any way you like it's just to dissipate a little bit of heat before it gets to the plastic so it's got some some rubber tubing in there that we'll use but we don't want it melting so doing a little coil here so it can dissipate some heat before it gets to that tube okay now this stand i've got on amazon it's a like a lab stand i'll put a link in the description down there so you can get one now what we're going to do is we're going to attach our main coil to this fitting here and then the smaller coil to this fitting here so so just put a bend in it there you want everything to always travel downhill so as your water is collecting or condensing in this line if you if it goes uphill and then goes back down you'll you'll collect a bunch of water in the tube and it'll take a long time for it to for you to get any water off the end so you don't want to collect them in the tube so do that now we're going to put this on here this is the i want to cut this in because it's a little bit mangled there it's not going to i'm not going to be able to put that on there unless i cut a little bit off see the end of the tube there if it's not completely round the fitting won't fit on so all right and that fits right on okay we're going to tighten that a little bit once you tighten this it won't come off that ferro will be locked onto the onto the tube there we go now we're going to attach this smaller one the side here everyone's still there or did the string cut out uh okay all right now we've got our chamber and our condensation condensation tube condensing tube and this here is for our pumped in air this here is to hold it all so there we go do i think i lost the feed it looks like i'm still there but no one's saying anything oh yeah i guess guess it's still gone k is still there okay all right there we go all right now we're going to hook our pump up the reason why we need this pump because with these bronze gas machines that don't produce that much gas under a liter per minute the flame will go out so we do is we add a little bit of air to the system so that our plane won't won't get extinguished let's start up the brown gas machine get it going this one here has a dual output uh i got it because you can adjust the flow on it i wasn't sure how much air would be needed to keep the flame going but um this came in handy being able to adjust the flow you'll have to adjust it uh and uh to the point where your flame stays lit so this here we'll need a extra piece of tubing come on so that's quarter this is 5 16. you need a piece of 5 16 slip your tubing in so it'll slip over the quarter inch here okay last thing is you can install your torch i'll put a link to in the description where to get these and also these flashback arrestors make sure you have two flashback arresters installed and then just install your output line onto the torch now on the end here in order to get it to seal up here on top we're going to put some teflon around this fitting here to look something like that so just wrap teflon around it look something like that that's going to seal it now we're going to go ahead and light it and then all you do is stick it in the top there it'll fit in nicely and seal and that's it now we're capturing that uh water that's condensed recombined together we're capturing it here in these tubes and it's going to cool as it goes through the copper line and then you're going to get deuterium depleted water out the bottom if we didn't have the air going through you wouldn't be able to sustain a flame so we need to put some air through it to sustain the flame also it's nice to have the air going through if your flame goes out all your lines will fill with brown's gas and then when you light your torch to put it back in the tubes will be full of browns guys you'll get a you'll get a big pop all the gas inside the lines will explode you'll get a big pop so this air going through it keeps the keeps the gas actually pushes the gas out of the tubes so that when you light it again and put it back in there you won't get that pop this this now is going to start to heat up it's going to get really hot you can feel that it's hot it's getting warm down here and then these are all still cool okay so here is the here's the kicker about this whole thing so you can only make as much deuterium water as the water that's being split inside the generator so if your machine can split an ounce of water in an hour the most deterium depleted wire you can get is an ounce if you have a high powered machine that runs at two three four five liters per minute it's going to be able to split more water faster so you'll be able to produce more deuterium depleted water so with this machine at about 450 to 500 milliliters per minute can produce one ounce of deuterium depleted water in about two and a half hours so it's not a very fast process i was able to get this from this machine in about two and a half hours now this here i sit in a large sample the other company had me take a large symbol but i filled this all the way to about here this i made with another machine that generates about four liters per minute and it took me about 16 hours to get all this at 4 liters per minute and then what i did is i ran it through a distiller i have a home distiller to take out any impurities and that this is the water that i sent the sample in that came back at 44 ppm so now it's going to take quite a bit of time before you you get a drop out of here but just put yourself a container or something to collect the water at the bottom okay ready to take some questions i'm not sure i understand your question hans no you don't have to run the gas through a bubbler if you're going to distill the water afterwards i don't think it's going to matter um if you don't have a bubbler that's fine but the bubbler takes out you know any lie that might escape uh if you don't take out the lye it's gonna end up in the gas and you may see it in the in the deuterium depleted water so i think it's a good idea to bubble the water first now we're real hot here now so now it's warm down to about here and super cool down here either the stream's lagging or there aren't any questions i'll leave the stream open for a few more minutes if anyone else has any questions i haven't done that calculation yet but at the rate uh the amount of money they charge for this water in my larger setup over here i could have easily saved a bunch of money making my own let me show you the other machine move this camera over here so this here is it's a little bit of a mess right here but this is the other machine um just to give you an idea how big it is there's my hand i've got a big hand too so that's it's 59 plates the plates are eight inches across it'll make five liters a minute easily uh water tank there and then i'm bubbling it through this large bubbler here safety first there's a flash port up there and then it goes down into a series of dryers i've got three in here now and then through this is a flashback arrestor also and then here is here's the torch i'm using for this one it's larger and then the chamber i use is right there and it's got the coil down here anyway i just set that up to uh to make enough water to send back for a test but uh yeah this machine it has the variable output here so you can control it that's that's the uh ac to dc converter because these generators run on dc and that just plugs right into the wall and over here i've got the my home so i distill the water before i send in for a test so this machine here will make the water a lot faster and it uses uh uses quite a bit of electricity but the amount of water you get out will be a lot cheaper than than buying it and before when i got the 44 ppm i didn't have these dryers here so i'm pretty sure if i dry the gas completely i can lower that number hans no the air pump keeps the flame from being extinguished it keeps the flame lit without the air pump if you're running a machine under a liter per minute the flame is going to go out so you need to pump a little bit of air in there to keep the flame going so that's what the pump's for yeah it's not it's not for cooling the air it's just to keep the flame lit it's also to keep the the lines free of any bronze gas in case of place in case the flame goes out it clears all the lines of brown's gas so that when you put your flame back in it doesn't ignite all the bronze gas in the tubing well i want to thank everyone for stopping by um appreciate you joining the last live stream and i will finish this video up it'll be up on my channel doubles11 and i'll have all the links in the description to

Rossman and today we're going to be multiplying fractions and mixed numbers and we're going to be thinking about pounds and ounces as we convert from one unit of management to another we're in our math journal on pages 258 259 weights of state birds so let's just jump right in problem number one a and B are basically a pair of input/output problems function tables so I need to multiply the number of pounds by the number of ounces per pound so in 1a all I have to remember is that for every pound I have 1 pound lb equals 16 ounces Oh Z okay so when I'm solving for the number of ounces all I have to do is I have to multiply the number on the left times 16 of course 1 times 16 is 16 if I were to multiply 3 times 16 that would be just like adding 16 plus 16 plus 16 and that of course gives us 48 so just multiply the number in the left column by 16 now you would do the same thing in 1b multiply the number in the left column by 16 however here we're dealing with fractions of a pound so we need to multiply the number 16 by a fraction now if you recall when we multiply a number a whole number by a fraction 16 times 1/2 one of the ways we think about that is that we are repeatedly adding 16 groups of 1/2 together now I'm not gonna write that out that's gonna take too long however there is a simpler way to approach it so all you're going to do is you're going to take that whole number here and you're going to multiply by the numerator of that top number so what is 16 times 1 well of course it's 16 so what would that be as a fraction sixteen halves would be sixteen over to sixteen hands now another way of thinking about sixteen halves is eight holes because when I have an improper fraction like that in order to figure out how many whole numbers I can get out of that I would take my denominator halves or two and divide the numerator in this case it's 16 how many groups of two can I get out of 16 well since I know that 8 times 2 is 16 I can get eight groups so how many Ounces is half a pound well if 16 ounces is one pound that would be 8 ounces so that's what you would do you would multiply that fraction by 16 using the formula and the strategy that I just demonstrated here now once we get into the story problems we have to use our knowledge of multiplication and fractions and mixed numbers to solve these problems so let's look at number two the yellowhammer is the state bird of Alabama if a yellow hammer waves 1/4 of a pound what it what is the weight of six yellow hammers so first we have to look at this problem and let's use ruckus as our strategy to break it down ruckus of course is we're going to read the problem multiple times we're going to underline the question we're going to circle important information come up with an action plan and then solve it now this problem right here oops has two parts so there's gonna be two questions and two solutions so the first question is what would be the weight of six yellow hammers okay now it would be important to know that a yellow hammer weighs a quarter of a pound so what we have to do here is we need to multiply 1/4 times six so I'm going to use a space below it to do my scratch work so it's going to be six times one-fourth now I'm again just going to multiply the top number the numerator by my whole number six so six groups of one-fourth is equivalent to six fourths okay so that would be another way of thinking of this is one whole in 2/4 pounds okay because I can get one group of four out of six that leaves me two left over so my answer for my first problem is one in 2/4 pounds now the second question is is that more or less than 30 ounces so again what I need to do is figure out how many ounces is one and two fourths well again with my knowledge of equivalent fractions I remember that if I have two fourths of a whole 2/4 is equivalent to one half as you can see as I reframe this fraction in two halves so one and two fourths is equivalent to one one-half pound and if you recall we just figured out that half of a pound is eight ounces so if I remember that there are 16 ounces and one pound and 8 ounces in half a pound if I add those two numbers together 6 plus 8 gives me 14 carry the 10 10 plus 10 is 20 that's a total of 24 ounces so the second question is is that more or less than 30 ounces well that would be less than 30 because it's only 24 ounces now let's look at one part of one more problem real quick what is the combined weight of three four and three-eighths pound Nenets from hawaii and to seven and five-eighths pound brown pelicans from louisiana so there's a lot of parts to this problem here I'm just gonna start off with one section of this problem and that is figuring out how much 3/4 and three-eighths pound a days from Hawaii would weigh so combined weight so 3/4 and three-eighths pounds okay so my problem is going to be three times this mixed number four and three-eighths now again a mixed number is a whole number and a fraction 'el component put together so I'm gonna use my strategies for multi digit multiplication to solve this so one way I could solve this is doing partial products and the way I would do that is I would rewrite the problem like so four and 3/8 times three and then underneath the the problem I would write the parts four times three and then I would multiply three eighths times three and then once I come up with each of those partial products I would add all the products together so four times three of course is going to give us 12 three eight times three well this I'm going to multiply the numerator like we've done before by the whole number so three times 3 that would give me nine and that would give me nine eight nine eight of a pound no 9/8 of course is an improper fraction and you could probably just see it by looking at the fraction that I can get one group of eight out of nine because 9 is just one more than 8 so 9/8 another way of thinking about that would be one whole and 1/8 left over 9 minus 8 is 1 so I have one group of eight eighths and 1/8 left over so now I would just combine these two partial products to give me my total product 12 plus one and one eighth well I have no more fraction so it's I just bring down the eighth and then twelve plus one would give me 13 so how would I solve this problem altogether well I would take 12 13 and 1/8 that's the Nenets weight and then I would combine combined as a fancy way of saying add add the way to what two and seven two groups of seven and five eighths pounds would be so you would add those two weights together okay try these problems out if you have questions reach out to your math teacher otherwise we will talk again tomorrow thank you", "c-yZDVHsLbw": "hey guys matt allen here welcome back to tactical bass and today we're going in depth talking about how to get bass to feed no matter how cold the water gets it's about drawing a core reaction a feed response how you can use a crankbait a jerk bait a blade bait and a rig to trigger a feed response in the bath in the coldest water in our last video you guys came out with me on lake chickamauga i had not been out in a while but we went out power fishing the water was cold the air temps were freezing there was ice all over the boat but we were able to consistently get bit on a variety of reaction baits we did not finesse fish and we didn't throw just one thing we threw all sorts of different baits and were able to get bit on all of them i sat down for a couple minutes on the boat in that video and if you missed that video i'll link it in the video description for you so that you can go and watch that one but i sat down on the boat and and gave a brief synopsis of this idea of triggering a reaction inside a bass but today we're really going to talk about it we're going to talk about why we use different baits to do different things to carry us through the entire winter so that you fully understand the concept we've done videos on each one of these subjects but today we're talking about how to use it as a system to consistently catch fish essentially in the wintertime there's three things that you can do you can go out and you can finesse fish tim did a video on that last week you can go out and you can throw giant baits and just try to catch a monster and i talked about that a couple of weeks ago the third way is triggering that feed response with a reaction bait the power behind these baits this time of year in the cold water and when i say cold water let's say anything mid 50s all the way down to right above the water freezing solid okay anywhere in there now i'll tell you the truth i have never cranked one in 35 degree water i just haven't had the opportunity yet do i think they'll eat it 100 but i have cranked them very successfully in 37 degree water that's the coldest water that i've done it in now and it worked and it worked beautifully the reason that these baits can get a fish to eat is because it has nothing to do with them wanting to eat most of the things that we do when we go fishing we're throwing a bait we're trying to fool the bass they're looking at your bait you're moving it they're following it you're trying to get them to think that it's real and then to eat it each one of these baits when fished appropriately doesn't rely on that at all it is about getting a core response a bass is a predator they react they have a core reaction and if you run a bait past them properly they will respond it's not about wanting to eat it's the way they're wired it doesn't matter if the water is 55 or 39 they react the same way and that has been overlooked by bass fishermen from coast to coast for years so why do i have different baits let's get down to that really quickly essentially each one has a job my favorite way to catch these fish this time of year is to crank them typically i'm throwing a deep crank okay this is the tactical dd tim and i designed this uh over the last few years it's been on the market for a little over a year but we designed it specifically for cold water cranking for triggering a feed response in baths there are a couple other great crankbaits and we did a completely in-depth video on this subject two months ago to get you guys started going into fall and winter again if you missed that i'll link that video in the description also we really want you guys keyed up understanding the concepts before the season even starts so that you don't lose any time but here we are in the middle of winter i want to make sure that you guys have got the concepts dialed so that you can get out on the water and have success day after day so if i only have one choice it's the crankbait okay and i choose it for a variety of reasons one i can cover a ton of water that's the biggest factor for me i can cover a ton of water i know if i run across them i've got my system dialed my gear is dialed my retrieve is dialed we use a combination of burning and pausing so that bait's going full speed and then it stops and then it takes off again stops that is what gets that core feed response and again we've covered that in depth in that other video but the deep crank both our crank and a couple of others and in the video description i'll link the exact debates not just the one tim and i designed for this i mean we're not trying to to get you to do something specific i'll link you the other baits that are phenomenal we use them in tandem to accomplish different jobs but the deep crank is my favorite because in most lakes not every lake but in most lakes those fish back down a little bit in the winter time you know they're sitting between 10 and 20 feet of water and that deep crank is perfect now the other day i also had a second group of fish we ended the day deep cranking but we started fishing very very shallow so i picked up this one and this was one that i've never thrown before this is a balsa bay it's a rapala uh ought to fold design it's called his garage garage slam six that little guy right there it's a balsa bait tight action made for cold water but for a shallower scenario so i was able to use these like a one-two punch fishing deeper fishing shower so my number one is cranking it's just my passion and i know if i run across a great big bass i can draw that core reaction the other one that's great for covering water is the a-rank okay there are tons of a-rigs on the market tons of them but they are not all the same just like with crankbaits they're not all the same there are people that will listen to tim and i talk about cold water cranking over and over and over again and then they'll go get in their crankbait box pick out any old crankbait it won't work and they give it up you have to understand that it is this detailed the action of the bait has to be right it has to be tight action it's got to have the right sound profile to match what those fish are feeding on not every bait is the same there are that's why we always say the exact same baits and we only use a handful of colors there is a small window that is near perfect for getting these fish to eat and then there's all these other baits that are great at other times of year but they are not dialed for cold water fishing well a-rigs are the exact same way okay there are tons of a-rigs on the market but they're not all the same essentially i carry two styles in the boat i carry bladed and i carry non-blade the biggest thing that you need to know about an a-rig is whether or not it's flexible okay we throw rigs that are extremely flexible this is a hog farmer flex the other one is a g-funk both of those are really flexible rigs when you pump that rod again not just a straight retrieve this is about triggering a core response so it's a straight retrieve paired up with either hard rod twitches or hard reel pumps and when you do that with a flexible rig the entire rig will open up and close it open up and close up when you're reeling that thing and you do that if a bass is following that school of bait fish and all of a sudden those bait fish split up and come back together that tells the bass i'm busted those bait fish know i'm here it's time and they take their shot so that is why you see us working that rod so aggressively when we're throwing an a-ring so an a-rig and a crankbait are both phenomenal for covering a lot of water to find those fish now once you've found them and that doesn't matter if you're on a boat flying down the bank covering flats going down bluff walls or if you're walking the shoreline making casts once you've found a grouping of fish you can slow down depending on what those fish are doing and how cold the water is there are three more baits that i turn to okay first category is going to be the jerkbait the jerkbait is again one of the very best ways to trigger a cold water fish into biting again it's triggering it's a bait that will sit in the water and then dart and when it makes that change those fish come after it but we've preached this before in the coldest of water the jerk baits have to be near perfect for it to work because the colder the water gets when you're working your jerk bait rip rip rip right that thing's down they're darting cutting then it sits you give it time to pause in warmer water you might only give it a half a second or a second so it doesn't really matter if the bait's not perfect and it's sinking a little or it's floating a little it's not as big of a deal but when the water's cold and you're pausing that thing for five seconds 10 seconds maybe longer and it's sitting there it has to sit there right if it's headed back to the surface those fish are not going to take the time to follow that but if that thing dirt starts starts and pauses and that fish is sitting here on the bottom he'll slowly rise up to look at it because that's not taking a lot of energy and then when that thing starts he's on it core reaction that's the way it works so the vision 110 and the 110 plus one are my go-to baits essentially this one runs shallower this one runs deeper where are you fishing how deep are your fish that's how you decide now the only other thing would be the 110 junior and the 110 junior plus one it's just a smaller size if you're fishing around smaller fish or if the bait fish that you see in your lake throughout the year are a lot smaller then i would throw the junior instead of the standard 110s but that's it and again we'll link all of this in the video description i'll give you my favorite colors of my jerkbait my favorite colors on my crankbaits my favorite colors on my a-rigs which weight heads we throw all those things make a difference and we'll give you all those details last two categories be a lipless and a blade bait okay the lipless now i'm not necessarily talking about chucking and winding if it's a warm afternoon the fish might come up to sun themselves and you might see me burning a lipless in the wintertime but way more often we're slow fishing on the bottom almost like you're jig fishing pull it up you'll feel it vibrate and then you hold that rod and it'll crash back to bottom vibrate crash back to bottom it is the silliest presentation but it works and it catches giants something about that combination of that vibration and that sound just gets monster bites so we will throw that lipless in the cold water but i will say now this is an lv500 this is my favorite for this technique the other one would be a jackal tn70 both are great baits for that bottom hopping now i'm not saying they're the only baits but these are the baits that we have the most confidence in and again key colors that guy there that's ghost minnow coast to coast we have been on so many lakes and this just works in this color it just works now as the water gets colder there'll be a little bit of variation in water temperature so i'm not going to call a set temperature but as water gets colder you'll find that that bite will just sort of fade away they just won't do it but they will continue to eat the exact same retrieve on a blade baby blade baits are essentially the same thing but they're just stamped metal okay so no no no rattle of any kind just vibration so it'll vibrate up fall back to bottom vibrate up fall back to bottom once it gets ultra cold that sound doesn't seem to work as well now i always try it because there's something special about that combination of sound and vibration that gets the biggest bites and you might only get one bite but maybe it's the fish of a lifetime but if they truly will not eat it if i've gone out i've tried it it's not happening i go to the blade because the blade the blade will work in the coldest of water there are a lot of really good blades but i find more and more the two that i turn to day after day are these two right here this is the mega mass the dino response this is a domiki the vault the biggest difference is that the damiki has a much more aggressive kick when i pull that rod it's thumping right it's really kicking hard the diner response see it's got this it's not a feathered tail but essentially a feathered tail it makes the action more muted so when i pull that one i still feel it vibrating but it's i mean in one hand i've got this and in the other hand i've got this okay they're completely different vibrations one is way more aggressive than the other i find that on any given day one of them is amazing and it just flip-flops so i carry both i tie both on i try both you'll notice in a lot of our actual fishing videos in the last month or two where we're out on the water and we pick up a blade bait that you'll see us catch a couple on a diner response and then the very next fish catch would be on a damiki vault well in between those two we cut the one off tied the other on to see is i'm catching them on a dyno response if i switch to a vault will i catch 10 times more or will i catch 10 times less what is it today so we're always switching trying to fine tune exactly how much vibration they want on that day now there are again there are a lot of different blade baits but those are just the two that i constantly find myself turning to and in a blade this time of year i really like a half ounce that just seems to be my best result typically because i'm fishing them deeper so again crankbaits i've got a shallow option and a deep option but my deep option is reaching a max depth of 18 19 feet okay my a-rigs i can do anything with but i typically fish shallower than 15. if i need to go deep i can but it's a whole lot less fun jerk baits i'm adapting to fish anywhere from a couple of feet down to 12 to 14 feet of water below that i'm switching to the lipless and the blade and i can take those and draw that reaction response all the way down to 30 40 50 60 70 feet of water so on a given lake once you know how deep your fish seem to be sitting because i'll show up to one lake and the fish all seem to be hanging in 10 to 20 foot not all of them but the vast majority of them then i'll go to a highland reservoir and it's split there's fish that are up there in 8 to 15 and there's fish that are in 30 to 40. and i've got baits that'll fish in both categories right so if you switch between different lakes different fisheries you need to pay attention to the right depth ranges that those fish just seem to be holding him because once you know that you don't have to show up to the lake with everything tied on right if i know that i'm headed to a lake where my fish are in 30 feet of water i've got an a-ring and i've got a blade bait it's that simple if i know that my fish are going to be right up shallow oh it's going to be fun i'm going to have all sorts of things tied on just go out there and try and get into some chaos so you just adapt it now with blade baits one thing that i will say the diner response has phenomenal hooks i don't change those at all but i do change the clip on top that goes away and i switch it to a hyper wire number three split ring that's the only change i make to that one on the damiki i change hooks and the snap and again i'll link that stuff down in the video description for you but you want to maximize your time on the water winter time is not the time to be messing around it's not the time to have issues in your equipment because you tend to get less bites in the winter but there's the opportunity for them to be giant fish and you don't want to blow that so really dial in your gear make sure your hooks are sharp you guys saw that in the video on wednesday where i started losing fish and sure enough my hooks had dulled from hitting bottom changed hooks and immediately got the best fish of the day and it had a face full of hooks it was hooked really well so you've got to pay attention to those fine details this time of year because you don't want to go through the time and the effort and the cold to try and get a monster bite and then have something small throw you for a loop guys hopefully this helps you hopefully this dials it in using different styles of baits but all of them are about triggering a feed response burn pause burn pause pumping and a-rig right they all have a way of triggering a core reaction if you're a finesse guy and you want to finesse it will work if you want to try and catch the biggest bass your life on a swimbait that will work but if you want to get out there have fun trigger a feed response and try and trigger a giant while catching a variety of fish these will do that too winter is an amazing time to be on the water there's less people the overall size of fish is bigger it's peaceful out there it's cold but it's peaceful get out there give it a try extend your fishing season into a whole new time of year and i think you'll really enjoy it if you enjoyed this video hit the like button subscribe to the

then for any real number X a function of the form y equals B to the X power is called an exponential function the big B represents the base value x is your exponent so in example 1 it wants us to approximate the expressions round to the four decimal places so it says 8 to the radical 3 so this is basically using your calculator the way you're gonna write it inside your calculator and I'm going to show you a breakdown is you're gonna hit 8 and on your calculator you have a little caret key for those that don't have it that's you'll see a little hat and then hit the parenthesis key you're gonna hit 3 depending on the catheter using you can write 3 and then hit the square root key close the parentheses and you're gonna get your answer so I'm in my calculator I'm gonna go 8 and then here's my little caret key in the parentheses and then I go 3 but I'm gonna hit the square root key see now it's after depending on the way your calculator set up you need to change it so I need to delete that back I'm gonna put square root hit the 3 close the parenthesis and hit equal I get 36.6 604 and it said ago 4 decimal places so we're gonna write 36.6 604 and the reason I don't go anything after it because after that 4 there was another 4 and remember it said 4 decimal places so fourth place here 4 does not make it go up so that's where we end up with 36 points 6 6 Oh or again the next one says 5 to the negative radical 17 so same situation 5 carat in parentheses you're right negative hit the square root key put 17 close it so when we do that in the calculator we get we're going again we're gonna go it was a 5 so we're gonna go five carat parentheses I'm gonna hit my minus key just because that's what's gonna happen to be square root 17 close the parentheses and equal and I'm getting zero point zero zero one three one is what I'm going right down so I'm seeing zero point zero zero one three one after the decimal place there's one two three there's my fourth decimal place the one did not make it go up so you end up with zero point zero zero one three for your answer when you look at the next one it's square root of 10 raised to the radical two so we're gonna have hit the square root 10 carat parentheses square root two closed so square root 10 carat parentheses square root 2 closed equals and we get five points oh nine four five six so we see five point zero nine four five six again you go four decimal places so here's one two three here's my fourth now that six is greater than five which makes the five increase so you end up with five point zero nine four six okay property of graphs of f of X equal to B of X so exponential function is defined by f of X equal to B to the X power where B is greater than zero and B does not equal 1 so in this graph depicted here first thing I notice is the graph lines do not drop below the x-axis what does that mean it means remember you're bound by zero your B value has to be greater than zero so when we look at our situation here you approach zero axis the x axis here the zero line but you don't go below it so the pink line you see here says the B value is greater than one which means that base value was greater than one so it's a one point one a one point zero one a three of five so it's getting larger the blue line that is decreasing here notice that it's coming from the left going down to the right the values of the B you fall between zero and one which means this is where you will see your fractions you're below point one that dollar values you approach one and you are not one zero comma one which is your y-intercept because it's hitting the y axis is your bound line that is your boundary point most graphs will cross through the zero one if it's in the base form so some rules that you need to know if the B value happens to be greater than one it's called increasing exponential functions so we know it has our exponential growth think of your economics classes if the zero is less than B less than one is called the decreasing exponential function known as exponential decay again think of your economics classes also think of decay as in when you're doing chemistry values finding the half life of radium or no billion any of those type of equations that is what exponential decay means it's approaching zero exponential growth it means it's going to positive infinity exponential decay is approaching remember that next thing we do knows the domain so domain means the exile so it's gonna be all reals negative infinity to positive infinity and if you look at the graph here notice that that graph line has arrows which means it's still increasing for the X's to the left it's still going XS to the right same thing with a pink X is the left pink to the right they still quite large range is gonna be between 0 and negative infinity so remember we didn't cross below the y-axis so we are going positive direction the line y equal to zero it's known as your x-axis that is your horizontal asymptote function passes through the point 0 1 because f of 0 is the same thing saying B to the 0 power which is 1 ok so we're gonna try some exponential growth and decay so it says graph the functions it says f of X is equal to 2 to the X power so remember you can refer back to a t-table so I'm gonna make a little T chart and notice we want to have negative numbers for the exponents and positive numbers for the exponent so I am going to pick I'm gonna go from negative 3 to positive 3 on the X's so you do you teach art negative 3 negative 2 negative 1 0 1 2 3 not necessarily will you'll always have to do these I'm just giving you a boundary so you can see what's gonna happen so we're plugging in negative 3 in here so it's 2 to the negative 3 power remember the rule you're not allowed to have negative exponents so you make it a reflection of it so this is actually 1 over 2 to the 3rd power which makes it one eighth when you plug in negative 2 same thing it's to the negative 2 a reflection is 1 over 2 squared which is 1/4 to the negative 1 1 over 2 to the 1st which is 1/2 - to the zero remember anything to the 0 power is 1 - to the first now to the first that results in a 2 2 to the second gives you a 4 2 to the 3rd is an 8 so here are our values and we're gonna plug them here so when we look at our graph when X is negative 3 the Y value is 1/8 so it's just a little bit above the line when X is negative 2 I'm at 1/4 so I'm a little bit beyond that when I'm negative 1 I'm at halfway point half the distance when I'm at 0 I hit the y axis at 1 when X is 1 I'm at 2 when X is 2 you're at 4 so that's 3/4 when X is 3 you're at 8 5 6 7 8 so what's happening is that your graph is going positive exponent exponential growth remember the domains it's gonna be negative infinity to positive infinity your range values notice we did not get both below 0 so we're from 0 to positive infinity okay we're gonna do the same thing but now we're gonna show to case so it says G of x equals 1/2 to the X hair again create your teach art because it's 1/2 think of so I'm gonna use negative 3 negative 2 negative 1 0 1 2 3 again so when we plug in negative 3 so it's 1/2 to the negative 3 power remember the rules that we learn back with exponents negative exponents if you have a fraction inside you are flipping the fraction in making the sign positive so we're gonna go and write this as 2 / 1 to the 3rd power rule 2 cubed is an 8 here we have 1/2 to the negative 2 power again think of it as 2 over 1 to the positive power so 2 squared now makes that a for 1/2 to the negative 1 power you're flipping it so it's 2 over 1 ounce positive 1 well 2 to the 1st is still 8 to 1/2 to the 0 power remember anything to the 0 power is a 1 here we have 1/2 to the 1 power we have 1/2 1/2 to the power of 2 means we square the numerator and denominator we get 1/4 1/2 to the third power means 1q 2 cubed so you get 1/8 so we have our values that we can draw our graph with so again we're starting with negative 3 next is negative 3 we are positive 8 so we have a dot up here when X is negative 2 we're at 4 when X is 1 negative 1 we're at 2 when X is your we're at 1 when X is a 1 we're at a halfway point then 1/4 point and so forth so we are decreasing we are exponential decay again the domains do not change domain is negative infinity pause a minute your range again even though it's zero down here remember zero was positive and you're still y-axis is positive so we are going from zero to infinity", "CcGp0vwvyv0": "in this project we use faux carbon cloth and heat-resistant epoxy to transform wood into a custom work surface this project came out outstanding think that's gonna be awesome man holy cow learn right now from start to finish how we created this custom shape from scratch from our wood shop to our showroom let's do this remember when you subscribe to our channel click on the red subscribe button and be sure to ring the bell so you get notified every time we have a new video thanks again here we go to build the core of our table we're gonna use 3/4 inch MDF medium-density fiberboard will cut this to the size of our cloth and decide the shape after it's cut [Music] carbon-fibre table what shape do you make it let us know in the comments below what shape do you make a carbon fiber table this is how much carbon fiber we have with an overhang what do we do [Music] black half better than a square I did totally do I kind of like that man okay first draft yeah nailed it I need a new jigsaw no Black & Decker is on this last leg I think I got this at Walmart fifteen years ago [Music] [Applause] [Music] so you can see I didn't stay on that line a lot I used it as my inspiration but I wanted to maximize the width of the cloth that we had so I went pretty big I got a little bit of from my jigsaw I'm gonna get a sander make it smooth let's do it [Music] [Music] I'm just progressively going through some sandpaper to make my MDF smooth to finish with about 220 grit I really want to double the edge up okay so that's why sanded right now is because I want to smooth edge so I could run a bearing router and it'll follow that nicely but what I got to do is not try to make curves underneath I'm gonna just rip strips connect them the best that I can and then will router that overhang it'll make a perfectly flush drop edge make sense I'm gonna get my pin gun with 23 gauge pin nails and some tight bond to wood glue and we'll make our drop edge where's the pen gun there it is pinata [Music] so I'm going to make sure that my wood overhangs my table so I don't want it flush I'm gonna bring it just over so I can router it make sure there's no void there I'll trace the line this will tell me where to glue my piece and we'll shoot it down [Music] just flip that over [Applause] [Music] you want to keep that clean so your router will follow it really nicely [Music] there we go let's just go right around that perimeter the combination of wood glue and pin nails is a great long-term whole next piece [Music] it needs to be a little bit steeper see that's plenty of meat there that's what you want [Music] let's do it we'll utilize our straight router bit with a top bearing to create a nice flush cut we're gonna do multiple passes so that we get a really clean edge [Applause] [Music] I love using foam as my table finish surface for my cutting and router in areas I like using it because foam doesn't hurt my router bits it doesn't prematurely wear them out plus it supports my project a hundred percent as I was router in this these pieces didn't chip out the weight of this hanging piece it didn't just pull my piece apart right at the end everything was supported I really like using foam as that tabletop base look at that I got my drop edge ready if that's not a custom shape I don't know what is okay from the beginning here we're using our 50 grit metal sanding disc will then switch to our random orbital sander and we'll make a nice flat smooth edge and be ready to start applying our carbon fiber cloth [Music] alright let's switch out our router bit to a round over right there we use that one alright what I like to do is test this on a scrap first so I'll grab a scrap of MDF I'll make sure that I got my router set the proper depth I don't want to lip on that so I'm going to adjust this just a little bit more I [Music] like to utilize a quarter inch roundover a bit with a bottom bearing so I could follow my shape and create a nice eased edge so everything will flow properly all right where we got our drop edge we did a really cool job you know it would have been a lot easier to just laminate two pieces together but sometimes you're gonna need a drop edge where you have a big island with the radius and you're gonna need to create a drop edge in this case we created a very complicated drop edge no problem I hope you guys enjoyed that content wherever I splice or butt joint pieces together I do have wood glue in those joints but if you have any kind of a void or anything like that I'm gonna pre fill that with some super glue and accelerator it'll dry in ten seconds and then I'm gonna sand it okay and that's going to give me a perfect fill in this case I really don't need to do that because I'm covering this with with cloth and so it's gonna hide anything like that but let's say you were just gonna paint and primer and then he pox you this you wouldn't want to get everything either bond out or super glue those joints but get every joint nice and flush first let's go grab our cloth and see what it's going to look like over the top make a decision on what color we're gonna go away all right we got red and black I really like both of these you know the black is really traditional it's it's kind of what that look is the red is is really kind of new-age I liked it a lot let me know in the comments below what would you choose black or red I've seen a lot of black I think I'm leaning towards red we might use this black on another project but let's lay it over our shape and see what's going to happen here save your old epoxy mixing containers you'll find all kinds of uses if you check this out over here they're great to hold screws they're really heavy-duty I also use them to lift things up off the deck if I want to test how this fiber is gonna lay over my piece here I don't want it flush to my plywood I want to bring it up in the air and then droop it down let's check this out I really think that's going to be I think that's gonna be awesome man holy cow look at that man I like that [Music] [Music] I'm very excited for this for the first step in the epoxy we're gonna utilize our quick coat we're gonna apply this with a squeegee on the raw MDF we only need a thin coat because this cloth is going to stick to a nice tacky epoxy and then we're gonna squeegee off any excess to get a tight fit we'll roll it over that preformed edge and we're excited to see the results we only needed about one ounce per square foot we'll use any excess on the edges be sure to coat those edges because that's what's gonna hold the cloth nice and tight I'm just making sure I got enough epoxy on the edges I don't want any dry spots where the the fiber doesn't want to stick so just rubbing that out by hand and then I'm gonna droop our cloth over I kept my cloth in the same direction that it was sitting on the piece I had it laid out where I wanted it so I kept that I'm gonna have just a little bit more epoxy here but I can just rub put the rest of this over that cloth and it's gonna seep through anyways it's just gonna be saturated on the bottom as well as the top let's do it this is gonna be really fun holy cow yeah it's biting really good it's I like that watch I mean it's definitely easy to apply I like that round over boy that makes that easy this coat of epoxy will be ready for the next step in about three hours because it is our quick coat and it's fast drying all right what I'm doing now is just dragging any of the excess epoxy off of the surface to get a nice tight fit and I'm not going to leave any excess underneath that might cause a wrinkle or a hump and it's working out great I'm really glad that I routed those edges with that quarter inch roundover bit I think it's making this process a lot easier I could really just envision a designer falling in love with this idea I mean you could take cloth or a print or a decal or whatever it is you want you could do this and then router in a company's logo maybe they manufacture something super industrial or you know you can really make fun signage and the possibilities are endless with this technique it's just it's just fun I it's something totally totally different than applying different color it's already kind of done for me it's just getting it tight to my project and and working it out you can feel the quick coat starting to get more gel on it it's retaining that a little easier so I think sitting here and babysitting this is a good idea - I really like quick coat on this step but just apply it thin remember thin to win [Music] all right it's been a few hours this sucker is it's not even tacky anymore I really like it it's totally ready to go you can see it's still really pliable it's really fresh it was about 2 and 1/2 hours ago that we finished up we're gonna apply our normal stone coat countertop epoxy we're gonna use our 1/8 by 1/8 square notch trowel will apply that will chop it will torch it just like a normal flood coat and we'll probably have to apply a couple of coats before all of the texture of this fiber is gone so let's get started on that first flood coat that's working another thing you want to do with your torch turn it upside down below everything out of it so when I come to the fresh epoxy there's no dust that spits into it Part B then Part A be sure to slow the drill down rub the bottom and the sides of the bucket then pull the drill attachment up off the bottom of your mixing container and go ahead and pick up the speed be sure to scrape the edges and you'll get a really good mixture we mix our normal stone coke countertop epoxy with the drill paddle we do it for about two minutes our room temperature is ideally 70 to 80 degrees let's apply the epoxy we'll travel it out we'll chop it will torch it three times make sure it's clear [Music] I'm gonna mix everything right here on the surface again Wow this is gonna look so awesome holy cow this is really cool oh my gosh it's like it's like a lens because it's getting oblong and then laying out but it's really 3-dimensional this is awesome and you see that okay let's try this sucker out I'm not gonna go all the way to the edge just yet I'm just gonna start getting everything out even this is our first flood coat we use three ounces per square foot for our flood coat and our 1/8 by 1/8 square notch trowel this leaves the perfect amount of material on our surface chop it baby here we go this is awesome I really like the shape I'm glad we did that utilize the Chop brush to break any surface tension and brush your edges out like a pro those edges stuck really good for me what I'm gonna do is build up a couple coats and then I'll cut that flush before my final coat but I'm not worried about getting that cloth off right now [Music] alright guys how do you get bubbles out we're gonna use the torch and we're gonna simply sweep the surface you can use a heat gun you can use different types of solvents we really like the torch because it works so fast and you're not introducing solvent to the surface that flood coat was super easy I'm gonna finish with my hand across these edges this surface is just beautiful I love it super easy to do we're gonna let this set up and we'll come back tomorrow we'll sand it and we'll do an additional flood coat all right it's all dry what we're gonna do is take this table and go cut off the apron the excess fiber that's hanging down we're gonna snip it off sand it and we're ready for our next flood coat let's do this [Music] [Applause] a metal cutoff wheel in conjunction with our angle grinders the perfect tool to remove the excess cloth from our project here we go [Music] we did an initial rough cut and then we come back and trim it nice and flush as a second pass finally we finished sand it so everything's nice to the touch we'll switch to our random orbital sander and sand the surface and the edges of our project with 220 grit sandpaper we do this to promote a mechanical bond between each epoxy coat be sure to wipe the dust a unique project here but no matter what kind of project you're doing with epoxy whether it's countertops or or this kind of a project the second clear coat is the same your gonna sand you'll make sure you get that good mechanical bond you'll wipe the dust and then you're ready to apply that next coat when you go to sand the edges do the round overs by hand and turn the speed down on the sander so you don't burn through any of those edges alright guys here's a pro tip for you always finish sanding the surface last I put some hand scratches in the surface because of sanding that round over and I'm going to remove that with the random orbital sander right now we'll finish sand with 220 grit [Music] let's go put a clear coat on this thing and see how it looks sweet okay let's go get some epoxy you can use a heat gun too if you'd like don't forget your gloves either the reason that we use a 1/8 by 1/8 square notch trowel when applying our epoxy is because it leaves the proper amount on the surface with no guessing I'm gonna trowel it out and then I'll chop it to remove any trowel marks even though we're doing a clear coat you can get an iridescent evidence that you trowel this so the chopping will remove any of that evidence it'll lay out crystal clear it'll look smooth as glass and your clear coat will be very professional [Music] that is so beautiful all right what I'm gonna do now is just scrape any excess out of the bucket into the mass of epoxy and the reason I put it right in the middle is because then I'll use my trowel to mix any of that that I scraped into the mass so I get a good mix we're gonna try this out close to the edges I'll get everything even and then I'll push it over the edge don't go over the edge too soon and waste any epoxy remember you only need 3 ounces per square foot on your flood coats that's part a and part b combined equaling 3 ounces per square foot we've now pushed everything right up to the edge we're gonna use everything leftover push it over the edge that's going to really give us our material to brush on those edges you'll have these drips and spots coming down and that's your reservoir to do your edges be sure to prime your brush so you don't get a dry brush starting when you chop because you'll actually pull more epoxy up there and it could leave a little divot because there's not enough poxy to level out also remove any loose bristles before you prime that brush when you chop the surface you're gonna chop it just as you would when you did color you're gonna do it randomly not in rows and not in a geometric fashion just be random about it and everything is going to lay out nice protip guys if you do everything consistently if you have a pattern about the way that you do things you your jobs are gonna come out more consistent more professional when you know what's going to happen you can predict the future because of experience that's when you get real professional results chopping the surface also guarantees that I'm mixing it one final time I mixed it in the bucket I used to drill I scrape the sides I mixed it on the surface I use that trial that helped mixed it and then finally I'm mixing it with the brush those three punches together one two three really give you a good consistent finish that you know is mixed properly no sticky spots all right let's do those edges now as you can see everything is rolled down those edges and we're just gonna use this epoxy to brush along those surfaces I'm gonna grab my torch but the first thing I'm gonna do is wipe my hands I don't want to get epoxy that's on my gloves on my torch because those buttons will fill up with the epoxy and it's really hard to use your torch at that point so take a second clean your hands and I'm not in a hurry because I have plenty of working time I'm not worried this is gonna set up on me really fast [Music] now that I have those initial bubbles popped I'll wait a couple of minutes and I'll do it again and then a third time I'll check make sure there's no air left in the surface and left in that epoxy I can see a little bit of fog because there's a little bit of air in there now after that initial popping when it's all these big bubbles you're not going to have that happen again it's going to be tiny bubbles but don't let that fool you there's still air in the surface so practice on sample boards know that you get that air out all right guys let's do a recap what did we learn from doing this project if I were to do this again I would probably take two pieces of MDF and laminate them together draw out my shape and cut it as one piece that would've been faster than creating a drop edge but it was a challenge to create a drop edge I hope you've got some value out of that so it teaches you in the future on any curve or any abnormal shape it's still possible to create that drop edge when necessary another thing that I learned is this cloth is fun to work with I could take this on a river table and maybe put a modern technique into classic furniture I could I could bring a piece of carbon fiber across something to give it that design element to take your project make it unique and take it to the next level this is a fun thing to do it wasn't very hard I learned that I will most definitely be working with this again if you liked this video give us a thumbs up let us know in the comments below what did you like about it and what did you not like about it visit us any time at Stone Cook countertops calm and we'll see you on the next video [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "oD_iXwgCCWs": "hey guys we use standard kiln-dried two-by-sixes to make this beautiful farmhouse table in this video we're gonna show you exactly how we built this table and all the easy-to-follow techniques that you can do to build the same thing for your space look at the grain and the depth that you get we use stone coat countertop epoxy as our finish coat to get this perfectly flat we really had a good time we're going to show you how we remove the tool marks how we stand the board's how we assemble and clamp our table surface together to get that rock-solid finish we're also gonna show you how we plan everything flat we're gonna show you how to get everything smooth using standard sanding equipment visit us anytime at Stone Koch countertops com enjoy the video alright folks you want to make a farmhouse table this is a budget-friendly do-it-yourself project that we're using kiln-dried two by sixes from our local hardware store we're gonna show you exactly how we do it step by step and turn these two by sixes into an amazing table surface the first thing that we're gonna do is cut them to size the reason we cut them to the size now is so we don't have to over sand and stain boards that we're gonna cut anyways after we cut them we're gonna sand them starting at sixty grit and work our way up to 220 grit keep it in mind we need to remove the tool marks the saw marks and the stamps from these raw two by sixes when we get that step finished we're gonna start the staining process this is a fun project easy to do stay tuned we're gonna give you all the tips and tricks right now let's get started and have a good time the first step we're gonna do is take our chop saw and cut all of these boards to length after we do that we're gonna use a 50 grit metal sanding disc to remove any of the tool marks caused by the milling process after this step we're gonna use our random orbital sander and sand these boards up to 220 grit to prepare them for staining okay guys we've got all of our two by sixes cut and sanded we didn't quite big we were gonna make it I like this size it's gonna be a awesome little farmhouse table and we're gonna stain it with true black stain right now and see how this looks here we go before you get started on your wood project make sure your moisture content is 13% or lower we do have a moisture meter you can test that wood with first to make sure the epoxy is gonna bond well it's no problem using a stain just make sure it drives before we apply the epoxy till drive you should be okay but it's still good to check and you could kind of tell how heavy those boards are if they're light you're usually really safe we're just using a blue shop rag to apply this true black Minwax stain just simply wipe it on and wipe off the excess it's really simple we're also gonna take a three-quarter inch sheet of plywood and rip down one and a half inch strips this is going to allow us to pocket screw a perimeter to stack our table against which makes the clamping process a lot easier okay guys we're going to use our tie back tape we're gonna lay out a space here for our table to lay on so that when we pull it off after we form this up and glued it all up it'll peel right off this 1/8 inch sheet of masonite using that Tyvek tape makes it easy after your table has cured to pull it up off of this work surface also we're gonna use those 1 and 1/2 inch strips that we ripped down and we're gonna pocket screw those using a Craig pocket jig that makes life really simple when you build your perimeter and you stack your table you have something to push against and keep everything nice and true you're also gonna use that tie bit tape on those strips so that they don't glue to your table pre load them with 1 and 1/4 coarse thread Craig screws this makes it really simple to screw everything down we're pulling against our backstop and creating a nice edge we're gonna stack our table up and get everything mocked up just how we'd like it okay guys we got all of these stuck in our form here we've got our backstop that's really tight that I could push against and that's not gonna move so I'm just gonna take this piece now and sandwich everything together so it's gonna hold it nice and tight when we glue this up we've let all the two-by-sixes dry for 24 hours after we've stained them and we're now building our form and building that perimeter so that we can mix up our stone coat countertop epoxy and glue all of these boards together it holds very very well it's been over 24 hours we've let the stain completely dry we're blown off any dust and we're ready for the next step we've mixed up our normal stone countertop epoxy we're gonna use this as our glue to glue all these boards together and then we're gonna put downward pressure with some of our two by fours and clamps and let this set up overnight let's get started we're just gonna use our standard stone coat countertop epoxy and our Chop brush to add a little bit of epoxy to each edge brush it on and squeeze these boards together one of the great benefits of using stone countertop epoxy to glue your table up is the fact that it drives crystal clear if we get glue all over the surface that's no problem it's gonna dry clear and it's gonna match our finish that we eventually finish this table with another great benefit is the long working time I don't have to be in a big rush gluing this all up and clamping it right away I could take my time and get everything just as I need it so I'm not in a rush and stressed out trying to put my table back together what we're gonna do now is squeeze everything tight put our board tight back to this table and then we'll start our downward pressure with our with our other two by fours here let's get started we're gonna finish off our table form on the perimeter by squeezing everything nice and tight so it locks together we're gonna use our extra epoxy and all the cracks and crevices and brush that in also use a torch and torch out any of the air that's in that epoxy so it dries crystal clear when you're gonna use these two by fours make sure the edge that's actually touching your farmhouse table has that Tyvek tape so it's a nice clean release after we've gotten all of the downward pressure boards clamped to our table we're gonna get our bar clamps we're gonna squeeze this table nice and tight so you get all those boards just bonding so strong that's key here just get everything very tight using your clamps we have plenty of time to go through and glue all our boards up situate them as we want put our downward pressure with our two by fours and then our pressure come in this direction bar clamps that's really important to have enough working time and not to make a mess on your actual surface that you're gonna have to sand all that wood glue and stuff like that off plus there's absolutely amazing strength in the bond that you're gonna get using ours don't cook countertop epoxy to glue this table up its tenacious all right we're gonna let this dry will come back in 24 hours and we'll start our next step we'll see you then okay guys our farmhouse table is all glued up what we're gonna do now is unclamp everything and take it out of the form and start our next step okay it's time to remove all of our clamps as well as our bar clamps we're gonna get everything put away and then we're gonna get our square drive out and release all these Craig pocket screws now it's important not to get epoxy in your pocket screws are also they're gonna be really hard to get out now look at how easy this table is gonna come off this surface because it had that Tyvek tape that stuff is amazing now that we flipped our table over we're looking at the top side of our table surface we're using our slab jig that can be found at Stone Koch countertops com this slab jig is perfect for flattening this farmhouse table or large slabs or any woodworking project that you're gonna prepare for epoxy we really love how flat it gets and how that surface planing router bit gets it very smooth okay the next step in our project we're gonna flip our table over we're gonna cut 3/4 by 3/4 inch square metal tubing we're gonna just leave it shy of each edge of our table we'll grind it with a 50 grit metal sanding disc and clean those bars with acetone we're gonna use a 2 by 4 is our straight edge and we're gonna simply use a 3/4 inch router bit and router on a channel so we can embed these bars underneath our table this stops our table from cupping or warping over time it acts like rebar now we're going to use our product called quick coat quick coat is going to be a fast drying epoxy to embed these bars so that it holds our timeline right on schedule this'll be dry in three hours and ready for us to sand as you can see at each end of our table we change the direction of our boards so we're gonna use little square tubes to create a long term join there as well okay now we're going to use our quick coat and some of our epoxy thickener and we're gonna create a nice paste we're gonna use our black metallic to tint that paste and we're gonna use that paint stick to put that wherever those cracks and crevices are and then simply use a bondo spreader to put a thin coat over the entire table surface this is gonna prep us so that we can do our seal coats and not lose our epoxy down those cracks and crevices after about three hours of dry time we're going to use our 50 grit metal sanding discs to remove that excess tinted quick coat we're only gonna leave that quick coat in all those cracks and crevices and this will give us a great finished product now it's time to start our finish sanding using a random orbital sander we're gonna start with sixty grit and work our way up to 220 grit removing all of those sanding marks preparing our table for staining we're also gonna router the edges with a 1/4 inch roundover bit this creates a nice edge for a beautiful table now we're gonna stay in the top side of our table we're gonna use that true black Minwax stain and a blue shop rag we're gonna wipe it on and then simply wipe off the excess now it's time to apply your first epoxy seal coat this is a 1 to 1 ratio and you're gonna do about one ounce per square foot we're just using a shower squeegee we're gonna squeegee on the entire surface and then use our gloved hand to rub it in the edges after rubbing those edges with our gloved hand we're gonna use a torch and pop any excess bubbles after that we're gonna let it dry and come back the next day for our second seal coat to prepare for that coat we're gonna sand with 220 grit and we're going to follow that same procedure by squeegeeing on one ounce per square foot and rubbing those edges with our gloved hand we're gonna do three seal coats in total and each one looks better and better now after your third seal coat has dried you're gonna look for any leftover pinholes we're going to address these using a burnin stick these burnin sticks can be found on our product page what we're gonna do is sand with 220 we're gonna take that Mohawk burnin stick we'll heat it up with our torch and we'll simply rub it in our little PennDOT and what this does is fill those before our final flood coat sometimes you get these little stubborn pin dots and this is the trick of the trade this is how you address those without doing a whole nother seal coat will torch that will wipe off the excess and then sand it nice and flush to get ready for our final flood coat okay guys we've got all this filled wherever there was still little divots we got those filled in and now we're ready to sand with 220 right before our flood coat so will sand it will wipe the dust and then we'll do our flood coat at three ounces per square foot and watch this thing lay out like a sheet of glass this farmhouse table is going to be amazing let's do it right now we're gonna sand and scratch up our table surface using a 220 grit sanding disc don't worry our flood coat will hide all your sanding marks like magic you're also gonna sand the edges of your table to remove any nibs and nubs and high points also where we routered be sure not to burn through your color and sand those as well wipe the dust with a shop rag and mix three ounces per square foot of our normal stone coat countertop epoxy we're gonna mix that for full speed for two minutes and then one final wipe with that blue shop towel you'll be ready to pour the epoxy right down the center of your table we're gonna use our chalk brush and prime that brush so that it doesn't pull up our epoxy where we start chopping we're gonna use our 1/8 by 1/8 square notched trowel to spread the epoxy and then we'll chop out any of those trowel marks using our chopped brush we're gonna chop our table surface then we'll use that brush to brush the perimeter to get a very nice even finish with long horizontal strokes will torch our table three times look at how it lays out after that we're gonna let our table set up for about five days we'll flip it over we'll remove the drips and we'll install our finished table legs wow this came out knives oh my goodness I really cannot believe how beautiful the flood coat makes this farmhouse table finish off remember those seal coats are never going to lay out perfect don't try to make them perfect they're simply there to stop the wood because it's porous from linking air you'll do three seal coats out one ounce per square foot and one final flood coat at three ounces per square foot and you'll get it to lay out like a sheet of glass that burning stick is just the trick of the day use that burning stick to get any of those little pinholes that are still there after your third seal coat and boom it's gonna lay out like you wouldn't believe what other stain would you like to see on a farmhouse table what else do you think would look good that's the question of the day also feel free to call us for free project support woodworkers and di wires they love calling in for free project

[Music] you", "CCLs_31SBTs": "welcome to another episode of black bass fishermen episode 9 this is another video on advanced bass technique so I'm going to give you one more before we move on to a different section and as new lures and techniques come out I'll put those up on my channel so here's a look at some of the baits I use in advanced bass fishing so take a good look around the table and you'll see a lot of different things that look familiar to you and if they don't look familiar to you I will be explaining all of them as we go along today so just take a good look get a couple of things as we go around the table as you can see I've got a lot of different things out so we're going to cover a lot of area today and so the first thing we're going to start with in advanced bass techniques is fishing with bass jigs now these are batch jigs as you can see they've got a jig head with the weed guard that guards the hook and you've got a bass trailer on there the colors that I prefer to use are a blue and black bass jig a red and black bass jig and a green pumpkin and a green pumpkin trailer now to setup a jig it looks like this so this is called a football head bass jig and this is a Berkley havoc pit boss so I'll hold that up for you this is a Berkley hat havoc pit boss and this is green pumpkin so what you do you take your bass you take your soft your soft plastic havoc and you take your bass jig your football head jig and what you're gonna do is you're gonna go right through the middle of the bass jig right through the middle you're gonna thread them on you're gonna keep threading them on and then you're gonna come out the middle and then you just push him on and that's what it looks like as you can see I've got the bass jig on there I've got the Berkley havoc on there and then I also have a weed guard so that's what it looks like see that little crawdad pattern looks just like a little crawdad and this is the green pumpkin now I use bass jigs all the way down to 1/8 ounce weight all the way up to an ounce and a half when you're punching cover and we did mass now basically to tie bass you're gone all you do is a knot that you feel comfortable with and I use your zuri hybrid fishing line when I'm bass jig fishing and I use 15 pound tests all the way up to 20 pound tests Berkeley I mean your zuri hybrid fishing line so basically what I do is and this is a new knot this is called the uni knot I go through the top so I go through the top of the I put my glasses on go through the top of the eye and I pull out about Oh 8 inches as you can see right here I went through the top of the eye and I went underneath the eye and now I hold these lines together and you're gonna make a loop and once you make the loop that's going to look like that so you went through the top of the eye came out pulled out eight inches and you made a loop if you could see that loop now you're going to go through that loop four to five times so let's do it so here's four to five times here's one two three four five now you moisten it before you pull this tag in you got a moisture net so the moist net and you pull the tag in took forms a little knot and the last thing you do is pull the line see how that just slid it's led to the eye of the hook that's a new knot it's called a uni knot and I've tested it over a hundred times and it does not break if you don't want to do the uni knot you could tie my knot that I've shown you in previous videos or you could tie my improve knot and that's the bass jig and that sits in the water just like that and these little flappers flap they move in the water and basilar bass jigs and you can fish bass jigs all season long you can fish them in the winter summer fall and spring and that's how you tie on and do your bass jig fishing and it's a really fun way to catch mass I recommend a medium heavy rod with fifteen to seventeen pound uros re fluorocarbon or tri lean a hundred percent fluorocarbon fifteen to seventeen pound now the next thing we're gonna talk about is the wacky rig and the wacky rig is a rig that you're gonna use when you're close to bass and you know there's fish around or if you're having a hard time catching fish the wacky rig is a good way to put fish in the boat and not have a skunk day out on the fishing Bay so for my wacky rig I use Gamakatsu and wacky rigs VMC hook so take them quick look at that that's Gamakatsu and VMC wacky rig hooks the Gamakatsu is a - odd hook for rocky rigging the VMC is a size 1 hook so let's take this hook out of the namamugi magatsu and i'm gonna show you how to set up a wacky rig if you just pull a hook out this is what it looks like now as you can see that hook has a weed guard on it so this is perfect for fishing up next to grass you know hydrilla cabbage it won't get caught up that much and the worm I use is a pal Berkeley power bait MaxEnt general this is a five inch worm I love Berkeley power bait MaxEnt baits for bass fishin or just the regular Berkeley power bait bass soft plastics either one are perfect so you just take for the rocky rig you go ahead and take a worm out and what you want to do with this worm and your hook is you want to hook the worm right in the middle now you see what that worm is doing once you hook him in the middle when you cast it out it's gonna do that on the fall which drives bass crazy and all you do basically is jig him in you just jig them right in so you take the worm you hook them right through the middle right through the middle let me get them through the middle there we go and that's exactly how it looks we guard up and as you can see you see that worm dancing that worms gonna do that as the worm Falls and sinks and there's the weed guard and basically you just go ahead and I want you to tie whatever not makes you come that you're comfortable with if you're comfortable with your own knots then go ahead and use those I'm just gonna tie my improve not for this one so you go through the eye of the hook you go around the line four to five times very simple then you go through the bottom loop underneath the eye and then you go through the loop that you made you moisten it pull it tight leave about a sixteenth of an inch on your tag in some people leave longer I don't and that's what it looks like look at that look how cool that is you see that worm working that worms gonna be dancing every time you jig it caps it out let it fall slowly jig it up and that worms gonna dance with the wheat guard on there and that is a perfect way to catch bass in tough conditions when no one else is catching fish it's perfect so those two rigs so far we did the bass jig fishing that's four structure points flat sand rocky area then we did the wacky red wig fishing that's we're up close combat you're throwing you're pitching it out only twenty-five to thirty feet you're letting it fall on a slackline and shake just like I showed you so now we're gonna go on to a new rig and this other rig that I want to talk to you about is called split shotting a worm so what you do is you basically have a hook 18 inches up from the hook you clip on two to three size five split shots so this is what I'm going to do it's called a slit shot worm rig so I use size to eagleclaw laser sharp hooks and I also use bullet bullet weights ultra 10 split shots size 5 so we're gonna start out with taking a hook out and these are size 2 eagleclaw laser sharp and then we're going to tie this hook on once again do whatever not you're comfortable with just make sure the knot doesn't slip you know I'm going to go 5 times around the line 5 times around the main line then I'm going to go through my loop the bottom of the eye and back through the loop that I made then you just pull it tight here we go now the next step is you're gonna clip on your split shots and I'm going to clip my split shots kind of close to the hook so you could see but you one of about 18 inches out of 16 inches to 24 inches away from the hook going up on the line and I use two size five split shots so you're gonna go ahead and clip these on you know how to put split shots or on you just go right through the center so you just put two of them on and that's what it should look like so you got to split shots on 18 inches from the hook you got your hook tied on and the worm you want to use for the split shot rig is real important okay you want to use a straight tip it's basically a power worm and what that is is a ribbed worm with a tail on it and the worms that I use when I split shot fish the new technique is Berkeley power bait power worms and this is a seven inch worm so let's go ahead and take the worm out and the color of this is pumpkin seed so go ahead and look at that look at that worm seven inch ribbed worm with a curly tail at the end so what I do is I take the worm I go through the middle of the worm about an eighth of an inch and then I come out this is what it should look like your split shots 18 inches to 24 inches above your hook there's your hook a eight inch in come out with the worm and there's your power to tail worm as you could see now you're gonna cast this out over small small boulders and you cast it out over flats that are anywhere from six to eight feet deep and you're not gonna feel a sputter on your rat your rod tip when a bass hits it all you're gonna feel is your lines gonna get heavy so if you feel your line getting heavy at any point once you cast this out let it sink to the bottom you're gonna pop it up about six inches off the bottom and reel in about three to four feet and you're going to let it sit and you're going to do that technique when till it gets all the way back to you and you're gonna fan cast from 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock that whole area from a boat or from the bank so that is the split shot rig basically that's a rig also from when it's hard to catch fish it comes in handy so much if you're having a hard time catching fish please use the split shot rig now the next soft plastic rig I'm going to talk to you about and I know you guys have heard about it it's called the net rig and what I do is I use Zee Mimms finesse mushroom jig heads they're made by z-man and I use the z-man TRD the last tech soft plastics they make networks and they're either three inches to 2.75 inches long so all you do for this is you get your Zee Mimms and you get a jig head out I use size I basically use size 1/10 to 1/8 to 1/4 and this is the 1 6 ounce size jig heads so you just grab a jig head a mushroom jig head you get a net bait out so for today I'm using Gary Yamamoto it's a 5 inch sinker 5 inch worm sorry excuse me and what I've done is I've cut the worm completely in half I took a regular pack of stick worms and that's Gary Yamamoto for me 5 inch cinco's and I cut them in half exactly and a half so you just take one of these little worms and as you can see this thing's only about 2.75 inches long maybe 3 inches that's how long he wants your worms and you're just gonna take the net rig you're gonna go through the center of the worm right through the center you want to go on about an inch and three-quarters feed them on and that's perfect that's exactly what it should look like you go in about an inch and a half to an inch that's about an inch and a half you then you pull the soft plastic stick bait all the way up against the mushrooms II men's net head and what this thing does is it's got so much action you use this on a medium action eight pound fluorocarbon line now you can buy the usery hybrid this is 12 pound but they make eight pound and that's perfect eight pound yuzuriha hybrid fishing line on a medium action spinning rod reel setup and what this does you tied to it whatever not you prefer my not it miss bounces and lands like this in the water now some of the baits doesn't have a lot of salt in them it's not gonna stand up like this it's actually gonna be like this but as soon as you drag it and bounce it that tells gonna go crazy but on the z-man ned rigged the TRD finesse worms those float and for the Zeman's i prefer if you just starting out use the z-man TRD man rig soft plastic stick baits because they're gonna stand up the Zeman's float their last tech and they're gonna stand up like that you're gonna jig it and it's gonna stand up and a bass is gonna go crazy and grab that thing and once again you're gonna do a light hook set you're not gonna set the hook like as if you were fishing with a bass jig real hard you want to do a light sweep of the action of the rod so that is the net rig and the colors I use is basically this is a watermelon candy color from Gary Yamamoto watermelon candy and the Z ends this is the PB&J so peanut butter and jelly color for the nan rig those two colors are excellent colors so we're gonna go on another rig and that's jerk bait fishing now I want you to see four jerk bait fishing I use Rapala X wraps once again for my jerk bait fishing I use Rapala X wraps and as you can see one looks like a bait fish pattern and this is actually a rainbow trout pattern anywhere that you've got rainbow trout eight to 14 inches a jerkbait rainbow trout pattern is excellent and basically what you're going to do what a jerk bait is you're gonna cast it out I use a spinning rod medium action spinning rod 10-pound hybrid or a fluorocarbon line you can use trilane 100 percent fluorocarbon you can use Berkley vanish fluorocarbon or you can use the yo Surrey hybrid ten pound test fluorocarbon so you cast this out on a spinning reel as far as you can and once it hits the water you go ahead and give it a good 8 to 10 reels to get it down to the depth that it's gonna stay at once you get this jerk bait down to about 5 to 8 feet depending on which model you're using you're gonna give it two jerks boom boom boom or three jerks you will up your slack and wait in hot conditions warm to hot weather you're gonna jerk this bait fast and you're only gonna give it a two second to pause you're gonna jerk it twice real and pause jerk it twice reel in pause and what's gonna happen is every time you jerk a jerk bait under water it's gonna move left to right in erratic action it's going to have an erratic action of the bait fish struggling to live now when a largemouth bass smallmouth bass love jerk baits you know spotted bass when they see that wounded bait fish they immediately come over and investigate it now if you're moving it extremely fast they're gonna smash it immediately now in winter conditions fall conditions your paws is gonna be 5 to 12 to 20 seconds and I know that's a long time but you need that when you're fishing so basically when you're fishing this you give it the jerks it's needed and it's gonna swing from left to right underneath the water and the reason why you want fluorocarbon line is when that bath swims up to that jerk beat and it's in the pastas ition just sitting still not jerking he's gonna examine it a little bit and the fluorocarbon line gives you that much more of an advantage so I hope you try out these jerk baits they work fantastic in lakes rivers reservoirs and ponds so the next bait we're going to talk about is a blade bait and a blade bait is basically a winner to a fall the winter bait and a late summer bait when the bass move out to deep structure any time the bats move out to deep structure I use a blade bait or I'll use a three-quarter ounce football head jig but I normally use a blade B my blade baits are made by de mica II de Mickey fishing tackle the de Mickey vault these are the blade baits I use and they're half ounce they're demean alt half ounce blade bait and the colors I use is a cream color or a fire tiger bluegill color and as you can see look how thin these baits are they're not like a square bill and they're much thinner than a lipless crankbait these are made out of all-metal with beautiful trouble hooks and the thing about the blade bait is it's got three different sections to tie to when you get the domeki blade bait it's gonna come with a snap basically a snap is right on the top of it a little snap and you can position that snap anywhere of those three holes now I always choose the middle hole I don't use the first hole closest to the head and I don't use the back hole that's all the way in the back so for the blade bait you just tie it on with whatever not you feel comfortable with once again I'm just doing my standard fishing not you know I don't need to name it anymore I've shown it to you on every video and I've also shown you the Uni not through the bottom of the eyelid and back through moisten it and just pull it tight okay and you cut off the tag end and I like to leave about a sixteenth of an inch on all my tag ins I just do that because I don't like a lot of tagging and hanging out but I do like something hanging out so that way if the knot slips barely you still got about you know 1/16 to 1/8 a 1/8 inch of tagging and hanging out so this is how a blade bait looks on the line now as you can see see how that thing is moving up and down that's what it's gonna do in the water it's gonna move up and down like that you cast this blade bait out in deep water in winter and late summer and all you do is cast this blade bait out you let it sink to the bottom and you jig it up aggressively six to eight inches and then you let it sink to the bottom again and reel up your slack slowly as it sinks once it sinks you jig it up again six to eight inches and when you jig that up its gonna go crazy it's gonna wobble it's gonna have a tight wobble and it's gonna throw some flash through the water and you fish it that way all the way back to it gets to you and these are called blade baits and they're wonderful baits for fishing in cold weather or in late summer when it's really really hot in the baths move out to structure and these are the colors I use I use fire tiger colors bluegill colors I use an all-white a cream color and you can even use a red and black if you want so we're finally to our last bait of this advance that advance bass fishing video and the last bait I want to talk to you about is a chatter be okay and I use Zeman's or revenge baits chatter baits and I use bluegill color green pumpkin and shad color as you can see this is a bluegill colored ChatterBait with the gold blade and this is a shad cutter coloured ChatterBait and what you want to do with these is you want to use a trailer and these are the trailers I use I use a raid swimmer 3.75 inch trailer on the all-white shad pattern chatter baits and on my bluegill or green pumpkin chatter baits I use a 3/8 inch swim impact comment' tech son Gill so this is basically a 3.8 inch trailer and these are paddle tail trailers so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and open up the trailers so you take a trailer out and what you do is very simple you stick this thing upside down you stick your trailer bait upside down to see how long the shaft is now when you put these on you want to make sure that your paddle tail is facing down so you're gonna go through the middle of your soft plastic right through the middle you're gonna go in about I'd say about two and a half inches or two inches then you're gonna come out you're gonna push this on all the way up against the jig head and that is what it should look like let me show you what it should look like so once you get your soft plastic trailer on there look at that doesn't that look just like a shad you know and I use 3/8 ounce chatter baits all the way up to 3/4 ounce chatter baits and I use the z-man chatter baits I don't throw anything other chatter baits but the z-man and this is real easy there's a little tie point on the bottom of the chatter bait and what you're going to do is you're going to tie to that tie point you know I'm just doing a standard my standard fishing not I'm not going to do the improve not but you should do the improve not or whatever not you're comfortable with so basically that's what it looks like when it's rigged on your fishing rod perfect ChatterBait and what this does as you reel this chatter be that blade you see that blade that's on top it goes crazy underneath the water and there's no wrong way to fish these I recommend a medium action for anything from 3/8 to 1/2 ounce a medium action rod if you go up to 3/4 you're gonna need a medium heavy you can fish this with straight monofilament line 12 to 15 pound test if you're going to use fluorocarbon use 12 to 14 pound test on the chatter baits and they make a lot of noise they're very easy to Lord a fish you just cast them out and start reeling in you can let them sink you can let them you know come up from the top only about a foot or two and I use a reel that's got a 6 3 to 1 gear ratio but you can use a 5 8 to 1 or a 5 5 to 1 and those are the chatter baits so I want to thank you so much for tuning in

a family of four on $10 a day and we're not talking about any diet but a healthy diet welcome to the healthy human revolution Channel here you're gonna find all the resources you need to live a healthy and abundant life everything from recipes to interviews with experts so hit the subscribe button and enjoy the channel i'm dr. laurie Marvis board-certified family and lifestyle medicine physician today we're going to talk about how to feed a family of four on ten dollars a day and we're not talking about any diet we're talking about a healthy whole food plant-based diet so when I started working with patients about eight years ago on how to actually eat a whole food plant-based diet I quickly learned I had up my game and the reason being is because patients were asking me well how do I cook this food what type of recipes they were coming to me with myths saying that it it was just too hard and it's just too expensive but as I started doing research and then transitioning my own family I quickly found out this is the cheapest way and the healthiest way to eat so we're going to go through a few things one have come up with about five different steps you need to consider the five that are going to be the most important that if you heat to those you're gonna be able to probably work within that budget I also used a local prices here are Walmart because Walmart across the nation and many times around the world and so these are local prices right now so I didn't want to make you think oh these are some skewed prices from something like maybe in all these which isn't and you know it's regional it's not everywhere so please if you have any comments about the the prices in your local area I'd love to hear about it and how you actually bite cheaper food where you live locally so first of all here's my notes forgive me there's gonna be a lot of numbers here but I really just want to explain the concepts you know you can come up with like a seven day meal plan but not everyone one is gonna like those foods and two I think it's more fun for you to sit down and see what you like and what food you have available to you and then come up with them and with within this framework that we're gonna discuss okay so first of all it's really important to take inventory what's in your food pantry what's in your refrigerator what's in your cabinets because what you have already is going to decrease the food that you need to buy so always look and see what you have first and then we can start looking into planning our meals for the week which leads me to the next one number two plan your meals and typically a two week rotation is pretty good most people are gonna find that they eat maybe 9 or 10 meals pretty fairly regularly so that's me you want to do and I'm talking about breakfast lunch and dinner honestly I eat the same breakfast every single day so it's pretty simple here shop with cash one if you only have a certain amount of money you're not going to over spin especially if you're going to the store after work or you're tired or hungry you're going to be less tempted to buy you know things that aren't healthy like those processed foods which are more expensive processed foods have to go through multiple steps and each of those steps add money to the price and decrease your nutritional value alright so when planning meals you also want to take into account for batch cooking ok that means utilizing leftovers and creating those leftovers and new meals so let's say that you batch cook a large amount of brown rice ok the brown rice can be used for a variety of things it can be breakfast lunch or dinner you can also let's say that you made some scrambled tofu well maybe the scrambled tofu was a burrito at first and then you make it into a bootable so those are just some things I'm talking about and last number 5 make your own sauces and dressing and there are so many recipes online look and see you know are you in an Indian flavor mood or Mexican or Italian Google a whole food plant-based diet no oil sauce or seasoning for that particular type of food that you're interested in for that day one this is going to be cheaper you'll make just the amount that you need and you'll know that there's no additives so those are the five rules I'd say for their framework and now let's just kind of go through an example for a day so you will just some ideas first for breakfast you could do like oatmeal bananas frozen fruit the scrambled tofu with seasonal vegetables so you really want to buy things that are in season let's say banana pancakes topped with pureed frozen fruit toast and hummus and steamed vegetables lunch could be leftovers it can be pasta with veggies hummus in a salad wrap it could be baked potatoes and salad simple as a peanut butter and jelly sandwich chickpea salad sandwich on top of a salad bowl dinner some things like soup and salad those are really common beans and rice with different seasonings again you know I love Mexican seasonings but maybe someone would like to maybe try an Asian type of burrito or wrap chili homemade corn bread burrito burrito bowls bootable spaghetti and homemade marinara which is much cheaper and healthier than the store-bought curries using lentils and starchy vegetables are very filling make your own homemade pizza and then snacks fresh fruits and vegetables and hummus so again just to remind you all the prices that we're about to go through our local - or our Walmart here and I live in an area that can be a little bit higher cost of living so I still was impressed that I could still do this if for example so this is just gonna be a one day I'm gonna break it down to breakfast lunch and dinner and give you the totals so for this breakfast and I'm not talking about having toddlers I'm gonna say these are a for a family of four that are gonna be you know adult age or you know teenagers oatmeal maybe not teenage boys you might want to up here the budget just a little bit but for the majority this should work oatmeal with bananas excuse me in half a cup of frozen berries and non-dairy milk so let's break down the cost when you look at the oatmeal it's 13 cents per ounce okay an actual serving is about 1.4 ounces and that equals 73 cents literally for four servings of oatmeal okay that's amazing one pound of bananas is 49 cents okay one banana weighs about 4 ounces therefore let's say we give everyone one banana that's 49 cents for the banana one pound frozen mixed berries is about 12 cents per ounce let's say there's about one point eight ounces per serving times four that's going to give you 86 cents for four servings of frozen berries 96 ounce of almond milk costs about 380 - let's say that we put four ounces in each Bowl or about half a cup again it's gonna be 64 cents so the total for a breakfast worth oatmeal a full banana and then half a cup or the serving for the mixed berries was half a cup with four ounces of and let's say almond milk was gonna be two dollars and seventy two cents that's incredible two dollars and 70 cents family of four a very filling mill lunch okay we're gonna do a baked sweet potato with a large salad and this isn't just your run-of-the-mill type you know iceberg lettuce salad with a little you know wedge of a tomato this is gonna be quite a delicious salad let's talk about it one pound sweet potato is about 88 cents okay so let's take two to three medium potatoes sweet potatoes so that let's say we give them four pounds or four potatoes so let's say each potato is about half a pound that's going to be one potato per person is a dollar seventy six and I'm going to put all this here listed below you'll see all the numbers 1 cup of salad so this is going to include greens tomato bell pepper green onion cucumber and carrot and I broke it down precise and cost you can see that below so the total for for for a salad is 317 that's way cheaper than going to a salad bar and weighing it per ounce much much cheaper and you're getting all this amazing stuff like I said you can also add dressings but this is a dry salad but you can certainly add hummus or anything else you'd like to this but for the total for lunch with this huge salad is four dollars and ninety three cents all right so for dinner if you did hear a little girl that was a dog so she's sleeping so dinner beans and rice with mixed vegetables okay so let's say one pound of dried chickpeas or black beans is about a dollar eighteen or seven cents per ounce that's incredible right so one cup of dried beans equals about three cups of cooked beans which is really good so you need about 10 ounces to feed four people which is 70 cents okay and then we have one pound bag of dried rice which is 78 cents per pound amazing which I quit is just about 5 cents per ounce so one cup of dried is four cups cooked and needed about seven announces for four people that's 35 cents so literally I'm just feeding someone beans and rice just the beans and rice alone for four people for one meal would be a dollar five that's incredible and now we're gonna add in our veggies so the one 12-ounce veggie frozen bag is gonna be about eight cents an ounce for people if you give them the full servings about a dollar so for dinner for the beans and rice with mixed vegetables is two dollars and five cents grand total nine dollars and seventy cents so you can see where I am here again you know serving size are gonna change per person and their needs if you have a small female she may eat less and her older brother who's a growing teenager but this can be done within that framework of really looking what you have you know utilizing leftovers and shopping in season and then of course I didn't even count coupons so there's many many strategies you can do so check out the first video as well we'll put a link here to actually watch that one so you can actually see how I break down all the different foods and the cheaper foods so but this is how you can feed a family of four on ten dollars a day so please leave your comments below tell me how you actually cut your food budget to feed your family healthy and don't forget to hit the subscribe button and I hope you enjoyed the video [Music]", "zAqoDmcLnEc": "[Music] so when i first had the idea for this channel i knew that one of the things i wanted to do here was make cocktails and drinks based in one way or another around music there's a lot of channels online that deal with video games or movies or tv shows and make specialty drinks or food dedicated to them but there's really not much as far as you know albums or musicians goes and the ones that i could find were very rarely you know music that is important to me and while the smashing pumpkins would have never been my first choice for what i wanted to do on here it just felt right given the timing not only is october 24th the 25th anniversary of their best album but in addition to that we're in peak pumpkin season right now if you don't know who they are the smashing pumpkins were an alternative band from the 1990s based out of chicago fronted by billy corgan you would think that being the front man to one of the most prolific and innovative alternative bands of the 90s in addition to owning your very own wrestling league would make you somebody that i couldn't help but love and yet somehow billy corgan makes it impossible to like him a lot of people think smashing pumpkins were a grunge band i think just given the fact that you know they rose around the time that grunge was really having its boom and i guess just the fact that billy corgan was so intertwined with courtney love as well that's actually a misconception though because smashing pumpkins actually disavowed any punk influence on their music and instead they have a much larger influence from gothic music and heavy metal and i think that's maybe one of the reasons that i just instantly fell in love with them and this album in particular the album melancholy and the infinite sadness by the smashing pumpkins is one of the most important albums of the 1990s one of the best alternative albums and did wonders for just production with guitar their music and this album are just filled with these dense dense landscapes of just thick layers of guitar just these walls i think billy corgan is a master at doing that and that i think is one of the biggest legacies of this band their catalog is chock full of just a bunch of really really solid albums but i think that in addition to my own opinion the general consensus is that this one is their best album every time i listen to this album i forget just how god damn long it is 28 tracks on the album there's plenty of iconic ones like tonight tonight and bullet with butterfly wings that even if you don't know the smashing pumpkins chances are you've heard it and in addition to that there are literally dozens of songs like completely you know produced tracks that just didn't make onto the album they actually released a box of those called aeroplanes fly high and it's just crazy how much time and effort went into this album and i could keep talking about corgan and the guitar over dubbing and a bunch of other cool trivia about the album but i think your ears would be much better served just listening to the album than listening to me ramble about it so i'm gonna hop into the cocktail now and as you guys will see i really was having so much fun developing this one and building it because there's so many different things you can do for a musician for an album when it comes to making a drink there's really no limitations with something like this and i think that doesn't mean it's so fun but also so challenging my first idea maybe a little bit on the nose was just to do a straight up pumpkin smash you know smashing pumpkins hahaha get it but beyond just the uh i guess the obviousness of that one i also wanted to do something that wasn't leaning too much into what i expected of a fall cocktail namely being the pumpkin spice there there's a lot of remnants of that drink in this one but it definitely took a different turn my other idea that i loved that i just didn't think quite fit i guess flavor wise the mood of the album was to do a melon collins so what i have here is an amalgamation it's part pumpkin spice part wholly unique so this is going to be a shaken cocktail not too many ingredients some you have to make yourself but that being said i think it's one that most anybody can do so the first thing you're gonna want is just a quarter ounce of lemon juice up next you're gonna want pumpkin juice this is something you're gonna have to make yourself but it's very simple to do the easiest way to do it is just take one can of pumpkin puree make sure it's pure pumpkin puree sometimes they include spices and whatnot just a 100 pumpkin puree add a can of that and a can of water turn it on just you know medium to high heat and let it get to a simmer when it starts boiling turn off heat let it cool and then bottle it it doesn't bring much flavor to a drink but it definitely has obviously the pumpkin kind of pungence and it's much more of a scent that you're going to get than flavor that's why as you'll see in a second it's not where we're getting the majority of our pumpkin flavor from i'm using instead in this cocktail as more of a lengthener up next this right here is the key ingredient to our cocktail this is pumpkin or jot or jot is traditionally a syrup made from almonds and sugar and sometimes some spices as well it's used a lot in my ties most notably but it has a wealth of other uses you can really make it from anything sunflower seeds pistachios walnuts you name it i made one from pumpkin seeds for this drink and i think it turned out delicious beyond just using it in this cocktail i think it's something that if you make will be a very fun way to experiment at home i'll link to a recipe below but to make this is very simple it is one part of roasted unsalted pumpkin seeds to two parts water and two parts sugar you'll grind up the pumpkin seeds in a blender slowly add your water then slowly add your sugar strain it through a cheesecloth or if you don't have anything else a coffee filter and there you have it bottle it and it's good to go and we're using half an ounce of this so in addition to bringing some pumpkin flavor this is gonna add the sweetness for our cocktail as well from the sugar in it up next two dashes of angostura bitters next up we're gonna use something called all spice dram saint elizabeth is the best brand you can purchase in my opinion for this you can also make it at home if you can't find at the store near you this is going to bring a lot of the spice to the cocktail that you sometimes associate with pumpkin while not bringing in a bunch of the other flavors like clove and cinnamon and whatnot the hardest part of this drink was deciding on the spirit to use with it rum was delicious rye whiskey was delicious but really nothing compared in this fall center drink with some layered apple jack applejack is the oldest spirit distilled in america it is essentially just an apple brandy there's a few other brands but laird's is probably your best bet so shout out new jersey people i guess this is one of their prides up there along with bruce springsteen and the turnpike i think now we're just going to shake this drink up basically what that does the one large cube is used for displacement and it's going to move the liquid around to help aerate it and the smaller little pieces are going to be used for dilution which is the other half of shaping the drink let me put the cap on and let's shake it [Applause] you're gonna do a gated pour for this into a rocks glass and we're going to pour this over a single rock of ice i'm gonna do a single sage leaf on top right there on the ice give it a little smack to express it a bit it works very well with pumpkin lastly these right here i'm a very big fan of there's some little golden star kind of sprinkles they really just flourish there are no way necessary for you know building this at home but if you wish to dress it up as i did i'll put that link in the description now that she's all done up let's give her a little taste oh i was gonna say some quote from the album here but i don't know i i was walking the line between unrecognizable and cringy so i'm gonna say it's delicious almost reminiscent of something with coconut cream or pineapple in it like i get some weird vibe of a pina colada here but it's in no way like that it's such a nice sweetness though the the pumpkin or jot this stuff is really good i mean it's sweet but it just tastes like pumpkin seeds it almost brings a pistachio kind of nuttiness there with it you get some nice sage wafting up as you go to it and the allspice dram is just that perfect little spicy punch the layers is crisp and refreshing but you're immediately never after that with that little twinge of allspice in your throat and the pumpkin juice in addition to making it a nice orangish color it helps lengthen it you definitely get some thickness in the mouth feel both from the two pumpkin ingredients i like a lot and the angostura rounds it out perfectly only thing i will say i think it's the pumpkin juice you can already kind of see it separates somewhat quickly you can maybe fix that by boiling yours for a bit longer but basically just drink this uh drink it relatively quickly which i have no issue with i hadn't really decided on a name for this one i'm still not sure how to do these music cocktails so if you guys have any suggestions if you'd rather see albums or artists let me know in the comments this is something i want to really do a lot more with i have plenty of ideas for albums that i think are deserving of cocktails musicians or even songs i think are deserving of cocktails but i figured why not start with one that was not just relevant but also seasonal so i hope you all enjoy i'm gonna enjoy this tonight tonight and i hope you all have a good one well don't throw it at me", "2FZgUC0F6XY": "when I was learning about shotguns I remember that gauge and all the different payloads was a little bit difficult for me to wrap my head around and so in this video we're gonna go over what each of those are I'm Chris Chang History Channel's Top Shot season four champion and professional marksman for Bass Pro Shops here we've got two different shotguns one's a 12-gauge and one's a 20 gauge and they're both Mossberg shotguns but how do we know which gauge is which at first glance they kind of look identical the way you tell is by looking at the stamping on the barrel it'll mention 20 gauge 12 gauge or there are other gauges available but 12 and 20 gauge are the common beginner gauges so now that we know how to determine your shotguns gauge let's take a look at what the ammo looks like here we have a 12 gauge round in the middle we have a 20 gauge round and on the end here we have actually another round which is a 410 round now the 410 round it's really small as you can see and typically it's more of an advanced round so I'm gonna set this aside and we're just going to talk about the 12 and 20 gauge round now the way this works I'm going to really simplify this for you is that be smaller the gauge number the larger the round so here is a 12 gauge round which is larger than the 20 gauge round another thing to take into consideration is your shotgun shell length two and three-quarter inch or three inch shells are common but they can go as large as three and a half inches as well this will also be noted on the side of your shotgun barrel so make sure that your shotgun shell length matches whatever stamped on your barrel now to talk about payloads we've got three common payloads right in front of us here we have birdshot buckshot and slugs now with birdshot as you can see here it's these smaller bb's which are common in competition in hunting and also in trap skeet and sporting clays in the middle here we have buckshot which were these larger bb's common in home defense and hunting and then finally we have slugs which are these huge chunks of metal basically really similar to a bullet let's talk now about the composition of a shotgun shell and what's happening here now when the shell is inside of a shotgun on the end here we have a primer in the center of the shell here now when you pull the trigger a firing pin gets released and hits that primer now what happens the primer ignites there's a small little spark that goes off inside we now then have gunpowder in this part of the shell there is a plastic wad that is holding the payload and the payload is all the way in the end of the front of the shell so let's take a closer look at the inside of a shell now that you know what's going on I've got a shell that I've already cut open so I'm going to lift off the outside part there and see a bunch of that shot come out here's a bunch of that shot and alright throw it over the left shoulder for good luck here is that what I was talking about all right made out of plastic and then finally we've got the powder all in there as well alright so now that you have an understanding of gauge and the different payloads birdshot buckshot and slugs if you're looking for a place to shoot check out where to shoot dorg to find a range near you and finally always remember that firearm safety depends on you", "Gv5JFKMolpk": "hey guys welcome back today we're going to be doing another shotgun ballistics gel test in my last video I did a 12-gauge broad head shotgun slug and I wanted to go ahead and compare that to just your standard 1 ounce rifled hollow-point slug so what we're going to be shooting today is the Winchester 12-gauge 2 and 3/4 inch 1 ounce hollow-point slug the velocity on these is 1600 feet per second the shotgun I'll be using once again is my Benelli supernova 12-gauge pump-action shotgun and as always the gel block we'll be using is my clear ballistics 20% ballistics gel block so I'm gonna go ahead and go out and set everything up and we will run the test [Applause] [Music] all right so here's the entrance to our foster slug on the left that little red thing it's from the broad head slug I did before and you can see the just devastating wound Channel again the one on the right over here is from the broad head slug but the foster slug stopped much shorter and had a much bigger wound channel and broke apart there's one piece there in the middle and one piece stopped right there you can see over here it started to break through the side of the gel block [Music] so here's our one ounce foster slug it looks like the furthest piece stopped right at eight inches and the first piece that broke off stopped at about four inches again with it just a devastating temporary wound cavity from all that energy all right guys this is what I was able to recover from the 1 ounce hollow-point slug this looks like it's probably half of it the other half I'm not sure what happened to it I think I had it I lost it honestly but that is a pretty good chunk of it I mean that's a heavy piece of lead and then some of this paper from the wad is all I was able to recover of that one ounce hollow-point slug well that's it guys I hope you enjoyed the video quite a different result from the broadhead slug that we did in the last video that one passed all the way through the gel whereas the hollow-point slug in this video just kind of stopped probably less than halfway into the gel however the wound channel from the hollow-point slug was it's much bigger and it just looked like it you know had a lot more energy than the broadhead slug did so they're both devastating rounds both you know 12-gauge shotgun slugs pretty much anything out of the 12-gauge is going to be devastating except for birdshot and yeah they're just super impressive and you know super-powerful rounds so if you have any questions or anything else you'd like to see just go ahead and leave a comment for me thanks for watching and I'll see you next time", "5FB5dgcVjUs": "all right so to find help to find out how much me servings of marinara sauce this will make what I'm going to do is I'm going to find out how many ounces of marinara sauce it makes total then just divide it by 4 to get find out how many portions so start with 16 throw with 12 pounds if it needs 12 pounds I'm going to set up a proportion 12 pounds is how many ounces I'm going to put X X ounces now I know that 1 pound is 16 ounces 16 ounces in 1 pound so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to just cross multiply x times 1 and 12 times 16 and that will give me 192 ounces 192 ounces the next ones of all tablespoons so I'm gonna come down here there's 16 tablespoons in one cup I also know one cup is 8 ounces so I'm going to do 16 tablespoons and 1 cup I have 2 tablespoons in this and the recipe how many cups is it and use x again cause multiply 16 times X 1 times 2 sixteen X is equal to 2 I divide both sides by 16 I'm gonna get 2 over 16 which is equal to 1/8 now I'm gonna trick change that into ounces so I have 1/8 cup that's gonna be how many ounces come and look down here one cup is 8 ounces so one cup is equal to 8 ounces easy cross multiply 1 8 times 8 X times 1 now x times 1 is just X 1 8 times 8 well that's just going to be 1 so 1 ounce so you can see that 2 tablespoons is equal to 1 ounce so this is gonna equal 1 ounce same thing here one else 1 tablespoon well that's half as much so that just going to be half an ounce these are easy 4 ounces for ounces eight ounces two tablespoons well we know that that's equal to one ounce one tablespoon we know that that's equal to 1/2 ounce and if I add these all up I'm going to get two hundred and twelve ounces but do you know how many 4-ounce portions so we're just going to divided by 4 and that will give me fifty three portions you you", "za4Te4Z3CZw": "Oh I'm doing lesson 27 session 3 I can use lying plus to show a detail okay this is what we're all doing so use fraction tells to find the value of each expression and you guys know to do that mathematically without using fraction tiles but if we did use fraction tiles - all right and we're going to multiply it by 1 and 1/4 so we'll get if you wouldn't do this for months of for its to eat okay so 2 bar 1 is 2 right so 2 multiplied by 1 you'll still get 2 and then 2 multiplied by a quarter right it's going to give me 1/2 and that's why I'm going to get 1/2 okay let's do this 1 2 and 1/2 - 1 and 3/4 so I have 2 and a half right so this is two and a half and I'm gonna minus 1 so let's take away this one all right boom boom boom he's gone - 1 and then I'm gonna - 3/4 of this guy right so I'm going to have to do this like this and in - 3/4 so I'm left with 1/4 and 1/2 so a quota and a half is going to give me 3 quarters all right that's how we use it fraction tiles to do that one all right let's look at this new line plot shows lengths of songs and minutes on Ron's playlist Ron adds two new songs to his playlist so his new pianist is known through they four minutes in length what are the two possible links for the new songs what is he problem about about songs what are we trying to find out right we're trying to find out what I need two possible links for the new songs so the last lesson we will plot it in detail that we had on the line plot and what we're doing now is that we're using new line plot to come up with D data right and what information is important so he had two new songs to his playlist his new playlist is now 34 minutes in length so let's see what are the two possible lengths for the new songs okay so we need to add all of these minutes up okay so we need to add between two to three we have one two one two three four so we know this is it's in minutes a quarter of a minute all right two fourths of a minute which is 1/2 and 3/4 of a minute etc so that's 3 3/4 3/4 and I'll put two quarters three quizzes so let's see so this song is no two-and-a-half this one is 2 and 3/4 this one is 3 and 3 so these are all of his songs and then we have three and the three courses is this one and we have two songs that are 4 minutes long great and then we have one song that is 4 and in 2/4 or we can tune in to 20 the first you what I have so how many songs do we have one two three four five six seven eight songs okay did we even get to here yet okay take a minute and see if you can get to there and then we are going to solve this all right guys so remember all of this data so what we need to do we need to add all of these to see how many minutes in total his original playlist playlist was so we can easily add this by a number of different ways you choose but this is what I'm gonna do I'm gonna add all my whole numbers because it makes it easy for me so when I add 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 4 + 4 I'll get 25 when I add all my fractions so I'm gonna add 1/2 I'm gonna add 3/4 plus another 3/4 plus another half right I'm going to get 10 over 4 which is 2 and 1/2 right and you see how I can get that because 1/2 plus 1/2 is 1 and it's record to this plus 3/4 is 1 and 1/2 so 1 and 1/2 plus 1 is 2 and 1/2 so my thoughts on time but this current playlist is 27 and 1/2 minutes right but his new playlist is 34 minutes so how do we know what how long what what any possible length sweetie two songs so we need to subtract we need to subtract his nucleus which is 34 minutes - 27 and 1/2 minutes and then we'll get 6 and a half minutes so we know that he can have two songs possibly three and three and a half minutes long all one could be 3/4 and turn up what's an onion the other one could be 3 enough what's up or it could be 3 and then the other one could be 3 and a half right okay let's move on to the next question Oh so you can use a picture to help you understand the day - any problem okay so this is what they've done right comparing class strategies this is exactly the example that we had up here before just looking at different ones doing it you can use equations to help you understand the problem so let's the writing equation to find m and is the length in minutes of runs original playlist which is what I didn't write here so this is my M right two-and-a-half plus all of these so I added all of these right finally some of the data set which is what I did right here which is what they're doing write an equation to show how to find a total number of minutes that in your son's actually length so new songs T equals 34 minus M we know that M is equal to twenty-seven and a half minutes which is what we found down here so the two new songs would be T equals 34 minus 27 and I have which will give me six and a half got it okay okay so let's make all of these connections now how many minutes M is right original playlist his original playlist is 27 and a half minutes how do we know because we added all the data on that plot how many minutes T to do two new songs add two runs playlists we know that it adds six and a half minutes because his playlist was 34 minutes long what are the two possible legs validity new songs it is more than one correct answer possible yes because one song could be three minutes long the other one could be three and a half minutes long all right we could have a three and a quarter minutes it could be this one could also be three or four ten minutes so yes it's any combination of two songs that equals six and a half minutes how did you learn what helped you solve the problem well the line plot gave all the data sets so I was able to add up all the data sets to finally to tell the number of minutes right and so I could all data sets which is every stone in its length how did you use operations with fractions to solve the problem so we added all right we added those fractions you remember me add any whole numbers we can just add the fractions you see exactly um okay so let's think do we have any questions at all okay let's look at number six and this one you choose what you want to do what you want to use okay so let's look at this problem remember collects ten shows that he beach and weighs each of them he uses a line click below to disability detail so look at how its labeled see show Weeds and it's between is it once's so he you have to say what this data shows right the measurement so it goes from 9 to 12 what is a difference between the width of your lightest and the heaviest shows Reynaldo collected show you look so let's look at this data and see what is the lightest so seem right hazy lightest so if I go from 9 to 10 how many data points do I have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 so that means I know between handed 8 data points so I know each one of these is 1/8 so this where this is heading I know that is 1/8 so that will be 9 and one in which is where I write it right here that's our lightest right what is our heaviest let's go all the way down to the end so it says it's 11 and 3/4 so that's my heaviest so I am going to subtract those two now they're number of ways that we can use to subtract this we can find lowest common denominator we can use equivalent fractions so let's try using equivalent fractions for a minute 11 and 3/4 if I were to take 3/4 and change that to an equivalent fraction where the denominator is it what do I get I will get 11 and 6 over 8 minus 9 and 1/8 do we understand how 3/4 is equal to 6 over 8 as an equivalent fraction because if I would reduce this by 2 I'll do 2 - 6 is 3 and 2 into 8 is 4 see I'll get the same thing so it is an equivalent fraction so now my denominator Sonny's team I can easily subtract that so 11 minus 9 is equal to what 2 9 10 11 - and then 6 minus 1 is 5 so I get 2 and 5/8 that's our answer all right let's move on to the next one all right why does he talk to the weeds of these shells you're not a collective that we less than 10 and 1/2 ounces so now we have to think we have to gather all the information that is less than 10 and 1/2 so 10 and 1/2 it's less than 10 and 1/2 so you have a one that weighs 10 and 1/2 right here so which means we are going to add up all of these so we know this one is 9 and 1/8 + this is 9 and 1 2 3 4 5 we know this is 5/8 and remember how I know that because each one of these is divided into eaves right ok and then this one is 10 and a quarter plus 10 and 1/4 plus 10 unemployed ah see because I have 2 X's so let's try to do this one quotes on if I would have do that as an equivalent fraction what would one quart to be as an equivalent fraction it would be from one quarter it would be two eats right so I'm going to replace this know a bit to each because that's the equivalent so let's add nine plus nine is 18 18 plus 10 is what 28 plus 10 is 38 so we have 38 plus 1 8 5 years right 60s 7 eat eats which is 1 plus 2 eats so let's add that up so we get 39 and two ears or 39 and taxi to toe okay do we have any questions on that okay let's move on to the other one what is the total weight of these shows Reynaldo collected the most often good question so how do we know so we look at this and we checked how many X's do we have on the same data plot that is the most and I will say this one because this one has three X's because it's almost often almost frequent right so it's right in between here so I know that's one eight that's 11 and 1/8 and [Music] what is the total weight of those shells so I have 11 and 1/8 plus 11 and 1 and that will give me what do you think it will give me yep because 11 times 3 is 2 D 3 plus 1 8 2 8 streets 3/8 of an ounce all right guys thanks for watching next time", "Vk3tMFHYSRE": "hey there welcome back and thanks for joining me all my supplies and equipment are down in the description box below and they all have links so check that out if you like this video hit that subscribe button if you want to see videos when they first come out hit that notification bell now what i want to do is show you i'm going to use an airbrush i believe i might change you know me um if i don't like how it does i'll change this is my master most the time this is what i use this is the wrong hair air hose uh this is my master and this is the little one this is the one i use ninety nine point percent of the time so um you can kind of hear it this does not have a dial it has a dial not a numbered dial it's a round of 15 to 25 and you can kind of hear it so that's the comparison with the noise this is my big fellow that's a model tc320 it is in the description it has a number dialed it has this is the dial that you do this with you put a couple uh airbrushes there you know kind of lets them sit there like this um but this is how it sounds now right now it's at a 40. i will turn it down to 30. see you hear that now this is what it sounds like down the floor so it kind of gives you an idea of the two price wise they're around 30 35 separate from each other the uh little black boxed master is in the 50s the other one is in the 80s or at least when i bought them so that's the range difference if you're going to do one or the other you can do everything with the big one but if you're traveling or you just don't want to spend that extra money i've done everything with the little one so you know it's a choice you can take some things into consideration and make your choice on that but i i like both and i do travel with my little one so there's that information all right i'm back and forth yeah i think i'm going to use this i i want to do the blowing petals but i'm the what i want to do with the head of the flower i feel is going to be a little heavy looking bulky looking for the delicate blown flowers so i do think i'm going to use this what i am going to do is use a couple of these colors i might use all three but i've got marine stone wash and denim the marine is really turquoisey compared with these two these two blend really well they they're close and they're the same type of blue the turquoise is i mean the aquamarine is that so it screams a little bit but that's kind of the part of life it picks up that color so um other than that i have no idea what i'm i'm gonna do um i've got a couple things in mind so let's just just just go to it so we'll do the denim i may have to do that yeah um i'm gonna put denim down maybe about right there we'll let that kind of mix i don't know if that makes a huge difference but i've been doing that and it seemed to work out all right i'm going to tilt this going away and see what it does and i just didn't do that the difference between that and the bulb the bulb will spread it out and b but i don't know do i want little petals i don't think so okay ditching this you know i always go back to this i don't know why i keep trying see how much prettier that is i'm going to figure out what to do with him so i may just put something down here because i'm going to put another one over this there um we'll do some stone wash okay this one's going to like come in screaming at you because it's going to be different but it's pretty cool plus i'm going to put some back over it yeah the first time i did i was like yikes have i messed up or what and until i finished i went yep you've messed up i've not done this i'm not sure if i like that but i'm just doing let's see i like how that does that's still bright well i just squirted that out me that right there is kind of weird wow that just went really nuts right there i don't i don't look good at all i'm gonna put some through here what's up what's that okay i like that shape just not sure uh but i think it's gonna it's got the potential to look really cool i want to cover some of that up but not a lot and i'm having trouble i think i need to need to turn my paper i like this is darker and lighter over here so i'm going to continue with that okay i'm going to drop it right here i'm going to do another one to cover this beginning of the color hmm okay so i still got some of that color and you know i don't know that looks yeah i want to put just another streak there so i'm going to do three and one more okay yeah i like that that bothers me but i'm still stopping because i know it's just me wanting it even so all right i'm gonna do black acrylic this is a daler ronnie roni and i have a rigger brush here okay if i do i don't think i want to do a cone i just think i want to do something more of this right through there that one is drove me nuts all right and this is just a little pen you dip in ink or you can use a stylist or the back of the brush the bottom of the brush okay all right i'm going to make a piece come down like this is a petal maybe here okay um okay i want to do the center first um i want to get that out of the way so i won't have to reach over things to try to get to it so i want to get that out of the way i am going to use my airbrush i've got it on 40. [Music] and what i did was take my stylist and i'm going to make put it down and make a movement and that's going to force it to follow that now something i need to do is get that dry because that was got this on fairly small and i'm just kind of swirling it and trying to direct it a little bit obviously i can't do a great bit of directing because so and when i started out i am that close but it's also little drops if it was bigger it would act differently okay i think that looks i don't know what to do about the white yet so i'll just hang on off on that i might do the posca over it and not spray it because i don't mind it picking up some of that i don't want it to be stark white um so it will come off with a little bit of a gray all right i may mess it up but i have more paper um i don't want much through here but just a little bit just a little something like that outlining it seems to be a different style unless i go in and really make it loose and very disconnected that is definitely disconnected so let me try that okay here is my liner where's that i'm just going to add something so it's not just a even now um i don't i don't know what else i could do that would i do too so just like i did that why not do that in the flower let's see pull off of it because i really let's see that kind of goes with that you since there's so many coloring layers in here i think there needs to be some secondary petals you know like two rows of them not just that one long i think that fills it in really nice and this is where you let your color say hey all right again may mess it up but all right everything's dry i really want to see if i can just do a tiny little bit on the ends not even maybe two places three places maybe here i keep going this way stop it i want to go this way there we go more than unintended but there we'll just kind of even some of these hmm thinking i'd rather not have done it but on the other hand i think they've been fine with that maybe done some extra down here but there's always another piece of paper but i do like it i am having fun with it i am having fun with it i do want to do some white so um i'm still bugged because i'm not thrilled with them although i might be but right now i'm like i wish i hadn't done that where is this one there okay after all it's just paper well both those didn't need to be there i'm holding it midway trying not to keep too much control over it i just wondered could have covered up but i'm going to mess it up all right yeah the hit this needs more and i think i'm going to do um posca this is not the big one this is a medium i don't know what it is l3 whatever that means point one okay [Laughter] i like the idea of it being more [Music] black and white versus the gray that i ended up getting in there okay that'll do like well it's different i'm not sure about it but it is different uh what about some splatters i do want to do that just because i feel like it needs something but not anything that screams good great water i have to wipe that off now all right there we go go play with that there's so much to play with leave things out add things you make these little shorter if you want i like them big i think but i definitely will be playing some more too so y'all go have fun", "LKxGhukePfs": "in this video we're going to take a look at ratios with applications from cosmetology the process of mixing hair color and developer typically requires a one to one one to one and a half or a one to two ratio of color to developer hair color requires multiple steps including the application of a mixture that includes the color and a product that allows the color to change the color of the hair which is known as the developer or oxidizer different products require different mixing ratios the most common ratio is equal parts of hair color to developer which means we're using a 1 to 1 ratio for example if two ounces of color or pigment is used to dye hair then an equal a part of developer which would mean in this case two ounces of developer is needed this two ounces of pigment or hair color to two ounces of developer expressed as a fraction would be two over two if we divide top and bottom by two or reduce this fraction it reduces to one to one and expressed as a ratio it's indicated here with the colon in between the two numbers if more hair color is needed say for a long head of hair and we're using a one to one ratio how much developers needed if six ounces of hair color is used well since it's a one to one it would be an equal amount of developer which in this example would require six ounces of developer to the six ounces of hair color expressing this example as a fraction we would end up with six over six which reduces to 1 over one and the equivalent ratio one to one sometimes such as in high lift applications a higher ratio of developer to color is used this means you may see ratios of one to one and a half or one to two color to developer there are brands which require one to two which means one part hair color to two hearts developer the one to two ratio is often seen in hide lift hair lightening products let's look at an example of a product that contains 1.4 ounces of color and has a mixed ratio of one to two this means you will need double or two times the amount of developer as that of the color and here's why if we take the ratio one to two and express it as a fraction one over two that fraction when set equal to an equivalent fraction where we already know what the numerator of the second fraction is going to be the amount of color in this particular product one point four ounces we would need twice as much as the numerator for the amount of developer so we're going to take two times one point four which results in a two point eight ounces of developer looking at the one to one-and-a-half ratio if you were to mix one part water to one point five parts drink mix you would say that it was in a ratio of one to one and a half that means if you add one ounce of water you would need one point five ounces of drink mix what if we double the amount of water how much drink mix is needed to maintain the one to one and a half ratio well if we double the amount of water to two ounces we need three ounces of drink mix why 3 ounces of drink mix with the two ounces of water let's take a look at what's going on first we're going to express the ratio one to one-and-a-half as a fraction next we will set that fraction equal to the original example of one ounce water 21.5 ounce drink mix all we've replaced essentially as the ounces water and ounces drink mix we still have a 1 to 1 and a half and then we're going to set it equal to an equivalent fraction that is a double set amount to maintain equality in fractions to get an equivalent fraction we need to multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same value so we are doubling the amount of water for an equivalent fraction multiplying the numerator by 2 likewise we need to multiply the denominator by 2 multiplying 2 times 1.5 gives us three ounces of drink mix and there's where we can see where the three ounces of drink mix is coming from when we double the amount of water what if we choose to use three ounces of water how much drink mix is needed with the one to one and a half ratio again if we set up equivalent fractions that need the denominator using the strategy of multiplying the numerator by three for the equivalent fraction we also would need to multiply the denominator by three meaning we are going to multiply 3 times 1.5 to give us a 4.5 ounces of drink mix to ensure we have maintained the ratio of 1 to 1 and 1/2 there is another way that we can solve for the missing denominator value and is to take half again as much of the numerator to determine the denominator in other words if we take half of three and we can get that one of two ways we can take 3 divided by 2 which gives us 1 point 5 or 3 times 1/2 that's half of 3 it gives us 1 point 5 and we add this half to our original numerator value we would have 3 plus the half of 3 1.5 which results in 4.5 taking this one step further what if we want 6 ounces of water how much drink mix is needed we can solve this using the proportion method what did we do to the numerator for an equivalent fraction it was multiplied by 6 likewise the denominator needs to be multiplied by 6 shown here 6 times 1.5 our ratio ends up with 9 ounces of drink mix otherwise we can use the second method just shown in the last slide add half of the numerator - the numerator to find the denominator so 1/2 of 6 is 3 added to 6 for the 1 and 1/2 there's our one part plus 1/2 part gives us the 9 ounces of drink mix required when having 6 ounces of water let's turn now to hair color examples where in this first slide the hair color being used needs to be mixed with the developer on a one to one-and-a-half ratio if you use 30 milliliters of color what amount a developer will be needed for the solution we can set up a proportion to solve for the missing of developer and using the strategy of equivalent fractions one times what gives us 30 it is 30 so likewise we multiply the denominator by 30 30 times 1.5 results in 45 milliliters of developer or the second method of having the numerator half of 30 is 15 that's our half added to the whole part which is 30 in this example 30 plus half results in the 45 milliliters of developer with the 30 millimetres of color to maintain the one to one and a half in this next example one part permanent hair color with one and a half parts developer is the ratio for this particular product what if 100 milliliters of the hair color is needed how much developers required setting up the proportion we would have our ratio of one to one and a half given we're using 100 milliliters of color we will multiply the numerator by 100 and likewise we'll multiply our denominator in our ratio by 100 100 times 1.5 results in 150 milliliters of developer or if you prefer the having method half of the numerator half of 100 100 divided by 2 is 50 added to the numerator for the one whole part plus the half results in 150 milliliters of developer with the given 100 milliliters of hair color in this last example we're given if a half ounce of color is needed how much developers required for the correct one to one and a half ratio using the proportion method we have our one to one and a half ratio set equal to our known amount of color over unknown amount of developer what did we do to the numerator for an equivalent fraction it's multiplied by 1/4 so likewise we would multiply the denominator by 1/4 1/4 times 1 and 1/2 if you prefer the equivalent of 1/4 is 0.25 it's decimal equivalent see and multiplying the ratio in the denominator of 1.5 results in 0.375 ounces or if you stayed fraction wise or an equivalent you'd have 3/8 ounce of developer using the second method where we take half of the numerator 1/2 of 1/4 to multiply fractions you multiply numerators 1 times 1 is 1 multiply denominators 2 times 4 is 8 gives us our 1/2 but then we need to add that to our whole part which is 1/4 1/4 plus our 1/8 half of that to add fractions together we have to have common denominator now we could convert these into decimals if we want but 1/4 can easily be converted to 8 by multiplying top and bottom by 2 2 times 1 is 2 2 times 4 is 8 so there's our 1/8 only now as an equivalent to 8 added to that 1/2 so we have our 1 and 1/2 method results in add your numerators 2 plus 1 is 3 over the common denominator of 8 there's our 3/8 of developer or again the decimal equivalency if you take the numerator 3 and divided by 8 you have point 3 7 5 ounces you you", "n-yN4lyz1Ck": "acquainted with

payments including a recipe book with 41 recipes inside and think about this this one pot this one instant pot is going to replace all of these appliances let me walk you through them we're talking about a cake maker a pressure cooker a Food Warmer a saute pan a rice maker a yogurt maker a sterilizer a slow cooker and a steamer so all nine of those functions happen inside this one machine yes you're going to be able to enjoy all the great benefits of pressure cooking because remember when you're cooking under pressure you're cooking with less time under greater pressure you're also going to cook with more flavor because it forces the flavor into every bite of the food Lisa Brady's days my friends having me what an exciting piece of technology we're hearing so much about and now it's finally arrived at QVC all of the great accessories that come along with this tell us about right okay so you're gonna get all these different accessories in addition to the pot so we take a look here you're getting your stainless steel rack alright that's dishwasher safe you're getting a rice paddle you're getting a soup spoon you're also getting a measuring cup and you're getting a condensation collector all dishwasher safe same as the stainless steel inner pot here and you're getting a manual and a recipe book with 41 colorful recipes a removable stainless steel cooking vessel inside your instant pot and yes that can go right into the dishwasher right you betcha sure can and this is what makes it so great you're going to love this because it's righty lefty you can park it on either side of the machine so no matter what your preference you've got it ready to go there are how many fails are our safety features built-in safety features because we know some people are a little you know unsure we don't want you to worry about it at all we've done everything here for you to make your life much easier I want you to see food and as we go along you're also going to hear about some cooking times because when you're cooking under pressure you're cooking so much faster oh yeah now we talked a lot about mac and cheese because this got some is perfect food before you cheese everyone know that you cooked dry noodles in broth yes I did and you know what she what she did not do because we just lifted the lid on this we just released the pressure on this the the macaroni absorbs all the chicken broth so you do not strain any of that away knew those noodles are perfectly al dente they're all absorbed all that liquid yeah now you're adding in your I'm adding in visa users and Parmesan cheese and some butter and some mustard and you can actually change the recipe to whatever you want to put in yours this is sour cream a little sour cream yeah it's some richness and something right but here's what I love David is because I started with that chicken stock all those noodles in there because they were dry they're absorbing all of that much delicious chicken stock if you don't want to use chicken stock go ahead use vegetable stock or you can use water but don't forget you're not draining it so all of that flavor is going right into your new doll and look at how quickly that cheese melted that big knob of butter in there is gonna melt down as well adding the richness of this oh yeah if you wanted to stir this up and park the lid back on there the residual heat and the cooker will continue to melt that butter sure and keep the cheese nice and melty and gooey gooey and fantastic yeah but you know what's great about this recipe and it's included in them in the and the recipe booklet I believe isn't right no this one is actually on the instant pot but what I was gonna say is you can add other ingredients to this if you decide you wanted to add bacon to it or you wanted to add some kind of protein whether it be chicken or Lobster yes for sure I actually thought doing some bacon for you because I've done that at home I have to tell you this is the very first recipe I ever made in my instant pot it is unlike anything the way that chicken broth infuses into the world makes it crazy is it I've never ever done this before well you know other than the first time here in my Viva but I absolutely love that and David you can keep it warm for up to 24 hours it's nice isn't it actually good it's nicely done yeah this is fantastic and that cooked in how many minutes that was 6 minutes David high-pressure minutes on high pressure 300 gone in this presentation this is the instant pot I do want to give a quick look at the control panel okay I'm gonna move this out of the way all righty we're coming okay tight just to let you know there's one button presets on here and look at all that you can do here because they're all included there just give us a quick run-through so soup and broth again 15 preset programs soup and broth meat and stew being in chili cake egg slow cook saute over on this side you've got rice multigrain porridge steamed sterilized overt pressure cook you have your plus and minus two so you can add your time you've got your two different pressure pressure levels you've got to keep warm and a delay start 24 hours on those so simple so easy we've done it all for you by giving you 15 preset programs take a look at these cook times and give us just a quick rundown of the kind of time we're gonna see sure David okay I mean it's really absolutely incredible the amount of time you can save so if you're doing short ribs okay you're gonna cook in 1/4 the amount of time if you were doing a traditional oven it would be 90 to 150 minutes in your instant pot Viva it's 20 to 25 minutes a run per round roast 30 to 35 minutes per pound if you're doing it in a traditional oven 15 to 20 minutes per pound here so you're actually only doing it in half the time whole chicken and we have one down there 23 to 30 minutes per pound in your instant pot eight minutes per pound that's one-third the time and then your your boneless chicken breast David 20 to 30 minutes if you're doing it in your oven 5 to 8 minutes that's literally 1/4 the amount of time that it would take you to do it in a traditional stuff it is an unbelievable opportunity for you to enjoy all these great foods cook them in a fraction of the time easy cleanup again because this cook that cook well inside comes right out goes into your dishwasher right look at this you can cook eggs in here to the perfection because we're gonna give you that R active in the box exactly so we're giving you the rack so that you can put that right in the bottom this egg feature has three different settings low medium high for doing soft medium R or hard boiled eggs there but hard-boiled eggs in eight minutes once you build it up to pressure only eight minutes love that one of the things I love in a pressure cooker more than anything is beef pot roast I used to love beat poppy pot roast for Sunday dinner but when mom would cook it in a traditional method right could take up to four oh yeah if not longer so long yeah this part okay so this pot roast David is sixty minutes so what I've done here is I can work one hour yeah high pressure wants it built to pressure so what I'm gonna do here is I seared at first then you want to take it out and you want to deglaze it okay then after you deglaze we're gonna just add all these potatoes alright so you're gonna cook it for fifty minutes alright so this has been cooked for fifty minutes on high pressure your raw vegetables going I'm gonna add my raw vegetables David and then all I'm gonna do is I'm gonna set this for another ten minutes all right will you do it on lower pressure because of the vegetables or the hoe no this one I'm gonna do on high pressure alright so all you have to do is hit that one button there and now this is remembering because I already had it preset because it has a memory it'll remember the last setting to low so I'm gonna do it you can see here on high and for ten minutes and that's going to come up build up to pressure and then that is going to be so moist and delicious oh it might just look like that oh hey let's not wait on it let's just show you one this finished right yeah magic of television so this is what's remarkable now I love this smell oh my word this aroma is just the best and I don't even think you're gonna barely need that knife this is gonna fall apart oh come on apart look at that and this was one hour this is one our David moist would you look delicious love the juices there oh yeah come on right there is what

is unbelievable I knew he had a little I had please don't get a little taste close them it's fall apart tender I know right now the challenge is getting it on the phone and here's the thing to David by those lesser cuts of meat that are you know cheaper because the the instant pot is so good so good my mother would make a pot roast this delicious and it took four hours come on why are we cooking any other way except in an instant yes over 500 of these are now gone that's some of the best pot roast I've had since my mom oh I appreciate it grazie good look at this cheesecake all right this is raspberry cheesecake David this is page 40 of the restaurant take to cook that here's your dessert okay that took 50 minutes all right so 5-0 50 minutes put it in a cake pan it's so fast so easy breakfast lunch dinner dessert snacks it does it all free me don't be delicious yeah perfect let's head down here okay we got more to share with you I do want to let you know we're over $26 less and retail on this is this lasagna I did it in a little pan okay so this lasagna David took 25 minutes total but only 10 minutes first okay 10 minutes and then 15 minutes natural release well I just want

water in I've got my trivet inside noodles going dry yes everything's dry for this one yeah there's all different kinds of recipes again there's an app that has over 500 recipes you can go to the page isn't it delicious really really Marva and this is 25 minutes yes lasagna ten minutes first on high pressure and then 15 minutes that it just pours out at least 25 total yep this is delicious so I'm gonna do a whole chicken here David why because this is a one pot meal wonder alright so I've got my chicken in there what I did first is i seared it I took it out I deglaze I put my trivet in alright and here now I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna decorate it I'm gonna put a little parsley on it put a little seasoning put it in alright and David this entire meal is gonna be I'm gonna put on here for 20 minutes here we go did it set I can't see there yeah alright so amazing this food is tremendous a pressure cooker is something so important but this is so much more than just a traditional pressure cooker it's also going to be all the other things you need in a kitchen when it comes to doing cakes whole chickens pot roast you're going to be able to make yogurt in this machine you'll also do use it as a rice cooker really phenomenal juicy unbelievably moist and tender chicken every single bite is perfect were five easy payments on your credit card and now in this show alone 800 of these are now gone Ms Lisa Brady yes you need to enjoy all this good food and share with your friends because we're going to line up for seconds this is delightful a little pota creme lava cake okay you gotta try this one you know what would be really lovely baked in the lava cake an instrument offi piece this is ten minutes David alright in a second with Stacie she's standing by with that in terms and a whole lot more thank you miss Lisa thank you yeah we're really excited sir top fine the largest collection \u00e5ngstroms has done for QVC Doug so great that you brought us one hung", "3yQHLbMBSf0": "hey guys and welcome back to crouton crackerjacks today I'm going to show you how to make the best custard a delicious bread pudding you will ever have topped with a vanilla bourbon sauce this recipe comes from meanies cafe and is directly on their website I did change a few ingredients though but let me show you how easy this is to make I'm going to start off getting my raisins ready I've got half a cup of raisins here in a small bowl and I'm just going to cover these with some boiling water this is going to soften up those raisins and make them so they're not so dry and tough in our finished bread pudding I'm going to let these soak for about a half-hour or so if you don't like raisins you can leave them out by all means next I'm going to get my bread ready I've got a 1 pound loaf of a French bread this is just store-bought Bakery French bread it's a good all-around bread for this and I'm just going to tear this into pieces and place the pieces into an 8 inch by 8 inch glass baking dish don't have to use glass don't have to use 8 by 8 you could use a 9 by 9 if you have that but you want to completely fill this pan with the bread pieces a 1 pound loaf does this if you're using some other kind of loaf of bread you want to make sure that you really load up the bread in this because once that bread is soaked up all the custard mixture that we're going to make here in a minute it's really going to compact down so fill this pan as high as you can get it within reason of course but I find a 1 pound French loaf works best for this now to get our custard ready you want a very large bowl here and I'm going to crack in 4 large eggs in here this makes a lot of custard so definitely use a large bowl for this and to my eggs I'm going to add in a quarter of a cup of plain granulated sugar as well as 2 teaspoons of pure vanilla extract and I'm also going to add in one stick which is 1/2 a cup of butter that I've gone ahead and melted and I let that cool just a little bit because y'all want to scramble your eggs when you had it in there and using a whisk I'm just going to whisk these ingredients together until those eggs are nicely broken up now to season this I'm going to use nutmeg if you've never used whole nutmeg and ground it yourself definitely do that the nutmeg that you buy pre ground party in those little containers they have no flavor compared to fry crowd nutbag so get a whole nutmeg and grind it yourself that is definitely preferable in this just going to whisk that together just mix it in a little bit and while I'm whisking I'm going to add in two cups of half-and-half you could also use cream for this and I'm also going to add in one cup of whole milk now you can use all cream you could use all half-and-half you can use all whole milk or any combination thereof I just like doing two cups of half-and-half one cup of milk it what makes the best bread pudding for me and now you want to add all of your bread into this custard mixture basically what you're going to do is just push your bread down into that custard mixture and let the bread absorb all of this liquid surprisingly it actually will if you have enough bread in there you just want to make sure that you allow each piece to absorb as much of this custard mixture as possible so just keep pushing it down pushing it down pushing it down and I like to let this sit for about a half an hour before I put it into my baking dish just so it you know all that bread can absorb as much of that liquid as it possibly can then I'm going to start transferring this into my baking dish that I filled up with the bread earlier and I'm going to layer this with my raisins the reason I don't have the raisins into the custard is because those raisins are just going to sink to the bottom so doing this way gives you a nice dispersion of raisins in your finished bread pudding so I put about a third of the bread mixture into my dish then I'm going to sprinkle some of the raisins right on top and I'm going to layer this up like lasagna and then I'm going to finish that up with the rest of my bread and custard mixture make sure that all of that gets into your pan you can see that this pan is very full take the rest of your raisins sprinkle those right on top and then you want to bake your bread pudding in a preheated 325 degree fahrenheit oven for between 40 and 45 minutes now you know this is going to be done when the center is just set it's going to be kind of like if you've ever made pumpkin pie cheesecake or something you want the center not completely set it will finish cooking once it comes out of the oven now before I serve my bread pudding I'm going to get my sauce ready I've just got a small saucepan here and I'm going to crack in a large egg and whisk that egg up make sure it's completely broken up before I add any more ingredients to that and then I'm going to add in three-quarters of a cup of half-and-half you could also use whole milk or cream as well as half of a cup of sugar I'm sort of whisk this together to dissolve that sugar a little bit also make sure that that egg is nicely whisked into the cream and before I turn the heat on I'm going to put in a dash of cinnamon as well as a splash of pure vanilla extract again nutmeg grind up just a little bit in there maybe eighth of a teaspoon or so and then finally I'm going to add in a splash of Jim Beam bourbon you don't have to add the alcohol if you don't want to but it really does take the sauce to the next level I'm going to whisk this make sure that every ingredient is corporated nicely and I'm going to turn the heat on to low and I'm going to cook this sauce until it becomes nice and thick make sure that you whisk this constantly because you don't want any scrambled eggs and your finished sauce and you know your sauce is done when it coats the back of a spoon it is nice and thick it'll thicken up even more as it cools a little bit you can see here the consistency that it should be kind of a thin pudding if you will almost a custard in and of itself here and then you can go ahead and cut yourself a slice of your bread pudding and try and work it out first slice is always the hardest but take it nice and slow and you can always get that first piece out and then you want to drizzle the top with you that vanilla bourbon sauce and go ahead and serve that up and that is how you make Mimi's Cafe version of bread pudding this bread pudding like I said is absolutely fantastic it's the best bread pudding that there is it's nice and custardy love the raisins in there they're nice and plump they're not tough and chewy like some of the other bread puddings that don't soak the raisins but there you go that bourbon sauce really takes this bread pudding over the top give this video a thumbs up if you'd enjoyed thanks so much for watching and we will see you next time you", "Ho8LyPZuBNg": "hi I'm Jax and I'm sassy Jax and today we're gonna walk you through how we created six Valentine's Day cards using my favorite things martini time stamp hi everybody I think I want to do some heat embossing today so I think what I want to do is make a background and do an emboss resist let's hope that this is going to be what I want I'm gonna put down a magnet to kind of hold down the card in place all right I think I have this situated now I have to remember to put the other card bases kind of in like that oh you know when I just forgot to put on the paper whenever you are embossing you must use anti-static powder basically it's in this bag and I'm just putting it on the card so that when I put the embossing powder on here it doesn't stick where it's not supposed to so let's get these all sticky sticky sticky and stamp doesn't look like the lemon worked out okay one down [Music] hey I'm gonna leave those sit off to the side it's melt art ultra thick embossing enamel Suze Weinberg acid-free dimensional medium for paper fiber and decorative arts in the clear it definitely melted really nice once I had the heat tool nice and hot we're gonna see how this goes I think well I'm trying this out I'm going to put on a little music and achoo chillax a little bit it's so hard to stay on top in the world when the world keeps telling you who you should be all these people tell you what you need oh darling only you can set your spirit free pay attention I ain't gonna stop it stop it honey everything you need is in your [Music] yeah if you could let it go and let it happen [Applause] with a little bit of magic you start a chain reaction [Music] this is what you've been waiting for when it all comes and you can just let go honey this is all that you wanted more when you open your mind and open the front door [Music] I have made seven cards which is one more than the six than I originally thought you are the vodka to my martini sentiment on four of the cards and I love you on the inside of all of them and then I went back and added some sequins and some Nouveau crystal drops in the antique rose every hour is happy hour when I'm with you I larger these took a little bit longer than I anticipated but they turned out wonderful and I love the results and hopefully you do too if you want to help my channel please like this video and share with a friend until next time love you guts bye if you want to

describe the math of what a standard drink is in America they often say that one beer is equal to one glass of wine which is also equal to one shot of hard alcohol but where did they come up with this equivalency between different types of alcohol the reason is the definition of a standard drink is 0.6 fluid ounces of alcohol and each of these drinks actually contains that amount of alcohol we can verify this by looking at the alcohol percentage of each of the drinks and we'll also write down the standard serving size of each of these drinks when we multiply the alcohol percentage by the drink size we find that each of these drinks contains the standard point 6 fluid ounces of alcohol and this is great for theory but what happens in practice let's say you go to a bar and order a tall craft beer now very likely this tall craft beer may have 7% alcohol and a tall beer is often served in a 23 ounce glass so what you end up with is about 2.7 standard drinks similarly if you get a cocktail and someone serves you a strong cocktail you may end up with something which has a little bit higher alcohol percentage and it might have a little more alcohol than the standard serving and so you'll end up with more than just one standard drink you can even run into trouble with wine many wines in fact are not 12% but they are 15% and some one might serve you a little more than a standard serving size so even with wine you can end up with nearly double the amount of alcohol so if you want to keep track of this number of drinks you're having in a night you can follow this formula the number of standard drinks will be equal to the volume times the alcohol percentage divided by six the numerator tells you how much alcohol is in your drink and the denominator standardizes this - one drink equivalent you can often find the alcohol percentage just by looking at the label and looking for the ABV which is the alcohol by volume there are many websites and even smartphone apps that'll do this calculation for you but if you find this is all too much trouble you can save yourself the calculation the calories and the cash by choosing not to drink for the night I hope you like this video

that means it's an acrylic without the thickener in it and more of a juicy solution so you can use it for a lot more things other than just a straight acrylic medium to make a paint a couple days ago I used it in my video which is up on YouTube to color the inside of these hearts i coated the hearts with the solution full strength and made the two hearts with the art pigments and again there's a video up there on youtube to show you how I did this but we want to go a little bit further on what else can we do with the solution okay a lot of people love the look and feel of the fluid acrylic fluid acrylic meaning it is a acrylic that isn't too thick doesn't have too much media to it so I'm going to take some a scoop of this ginger peach okay and this is an eyeball guys you know you're just gonna have to eyeball what you think one part to two parts is an approximately two part of this solution take my little stir stick and mix this up and now I have just made of course I can make a bigger batch of this but for the sample of the video I've now made a little liquid acrylic a fluid acrylic gorgeous absolutely gorgeous to play with here it is with my paintbrush and I can use it on any project where I would want to use an acrylic a more fluid liquid acrylic there's the ginger peach painted with the solution one part color two-part solution to make male fluid acrylic okay well what if I also wanted to make a spray okay there are specific instructions with measurements here but I happen to have an empty a reading rain spray bottle so I'm going to take that same little scoop okay and to measure my color and I want approximately a tablespoon to two ounces so this is basically a one and a half ounce bottle so I'm going to measure after I get my water in here I'm going to measure the estimate some acrylic in there so I'm going to fill this bottle up about halfway up with water it's just tap water you can see the bottle is halfway full of water okay I'm going to squeeze what looks maybe about a teaspoon and a half of the acrylic medium in there the solution the solution that's what we're playing with today I'm an add a scoop of Bolivian blue which is a color that is not available in the radiant rains and by the way we are discontinuing radiant rains pre-made in this spray so it's good to learn how to make your own sprays in your own custom colors we have two hundred and twenty colors in the art pigments and I think only fifty six colors actually made it in the radiant rain I'm gonna add a scoop of this color and I'm going to swirl the color I'll put a top on here so we don't really make a mess but by swirling I mean I'm swirling the bottom of the bottle to mix it up I'm not shaking it up and down if you shake it up and down you risk that all the mica particulates and the color particulate sand that believing in blue I just added could go up into the head of your spray bottle and clog so you want to swirl the color spray bottles spray tops were not really meant to have mica particulates come through them even though the craft industry doesn't agree with that because we've all been crazy for those spray colors so now that I've made my own Bolivian blue spray look how gorgeous that is I just made my own spray okay um clean up this area here one other reason I made this product what really inspired is I was seeing a lot of artists that were needing some form of spray fixative to set the art pigments down on a surface you know say they got the colors layered on a surface okay but they wanted to set it how are they going to set the colors on the surface one thing once they got it on there or they're sprinkling it on their canvases when they're doing their makes me to work so again fill the bottle I think the recipe says one part three parts but really even 50/50 will work I just try to be conservative say one part three parts because I don't want you messing your spray head up with too much of acrylic so I've got this about three-quarters the way full this is a two ounce bottle three quarters of the way full with water I know when I turn it to Sun it doesn't look through quarters away flow but it's 3/4 away fall I'm going to fill this almost all the way up and now I've got a full two ounce bottle of my spray fixative that I've just made for this okay so if I've got some pigments that I've laid down on a project and I wanted here them further I want them to be fixed per say fixed for a better lack of words on my surface I can now use this spray fixative to set the color down and make it more permanent okay so that's the news about the solution our new acrylic wash I hope you've enjoyed this thank you for your time bye bye", "OmJ1Jie902s": "good morning everybody I wanted to give you a real view of the items that I am able to fit in our arctic fox 8:11 as far as my clothes it's kind of crazy when I think about how much stuff is actually here and I've gotten rid of some of it because I just don't have a need for it although some of this stuff I decided just in case I should hold on to so anyway I'm going to show you how what we have here I do have some hanging that I didn't hang up here and you'll notice it's just all my comfy stuff because that's what we merit we're mostly I don't need the work clothes and all that stuff so I keep my undergarments and this handy-dandy basket which stores perfectly right in there I hang my hat's up and then I put I've got some dresses and I go over here and the backside because I don't really need to get to them at um and some of my other dresses with shirts and then I have a lot of my little tank tops and our golfing stuff which we actually didn't bring our golf stuff with us that's okay t-shirts tank tops pants I got more than enough pants more than enough shorts so when you fold them right I mean you can hold a lot of stuff in there that's crazy and then in this portion I don't know if you can see that very well or not but I've hit all of this stuff in there starting with extra little throws in case we decide we get chilly extra pocketbooks because you know should we decide to go out and I can always don't dress up my jeans sweatshirts this is great because you can actually just keep piling stuff in and it doesn't matter I did bring some winner type items for win it it's chilly depending on where we're visiting so as you can see all of that fit perfectly and I still have women so ladies can you believe how much room there is in this arctic fox as I shared there's still plenty of extra space if you wanted to put some more things in overall this totally meets our needs well I hope you enjoyed that quick little show-and-tell and thanks for watching have a great day", "r_Pe74mPoDk": "[Music] hi class we are going to study today about optimization and modeling part one so this is after all these derivatives that you have to study it comes with a word problems and we will see real problems here then how we are going to apply calculus and I break into two parts so basically you're gonna do whole complete three pages with me and then second part is going to be I'm going to help you have up to the making the function and then you are going to do derivative part with the textbook and then there's a last part that you are going to do two questions by yourself so I kind of break it into like a game part level 1 level 2 level 3 so while you go through this one I hope that you understand the power of the calculus okay so it will be fun actually I really really enjoyed this part and um it will be a little bit difficult but just pay attention to my explanation and then you will you can do it after you do like 10 questions you may see some parents that's what happened to me so just bear with me and then enjoy so farmer has a 2400 feet of fencing and he wants to fence off rectangular field that borders are straight river he needs no fence along the river what are the dimensions of the field that has the largest area okay so when you read this question always I wanted to raise two times or three times that's what I will do and then first of all this would be it briefly and that is a circle although the important information and try to see that what I try to use what I try to use as an X and then what I like to get as output so this is like a for me computer programming so because all the programming will have about one or two inputs and then output like password and then domain of your email address like that so now when you read it if you don't get it let's just forget the clue what's going on with drawing some figures so there farmer has a twenty four hundred feet of a fantasy so it poor amount that he can use friends length is a twenty four hundred and then he wants to find someone one side is River so here's a river and there's a boat and she liked to fence around like this three side so no offense along the river and these total three sides of the length is 2400 then what they want to get here so when you see what is that dimensional they feel that the highlight word would be largest area that's what we'd like to optimize when will be the largest area so when you look at this one largest area is going to be my output so that's going to be area then input will be what I like to find the area then your input had to be no one on this side so I will set this one is X so info will be X length of the side then as you see the rectangle this is going to be X as well and also think about while with the top then there will be who do I have a 2,400 as a total length of offense but I use a 2x that part would be to 2,400 minus 2x and now I want to find the area of a rectangle that will be length times width so how can I write the function here so area function of input X will be length times width in this case will be these two numbers so 2,400 minus 2x times X that's what I like to optimize because I want to optimize the area so that's why I multiply length times width I'm going to tell you when you do this one with me it looks really easy and when you did by yourself you will have a little fun there so just pay attention together with me and in here why is it going on let me just to tell you what's going on in here first think about if I have a just a poor ol rectangle and if the 2,400 feet I can only use one side don't just give yourself example here I can probably make it a hundred and a hundred and a hundred does it make total 2,450 right then what is the area this time my area is going to be 6,400 square feet and this time necesita if I can built a triangle with and rectangle with different measurement here if I 100 that will be 400 right then this is going to be 1600 so total when you add it makes it 2400 feet then while with the area let's multiply this one and that's wrong Oh Winston I didn't mean to do this one Wow so they actually give you stain dimension is that correct uh-huh then I'm going to make it a little bit different so this time let's try with actually thousand here this will be thousand my graph is not that great and this is me twenty four hundred and thousand thirty two and then four hundred twenty four hundred feet then what will be my area I'm not making me stay oh I need more zeros right through zero that math teacher zero zero so here this is going to be forty one two three four yeah sorry about that and then so now I will write it my area carefully so did you notice there actually I have a stain on ma no defense length but you can totally have four hundred thousand verses sixty-four that's actually fifty percent more than this one then if your farmer you want to actually do this way with the other way right there's a full fun I wanna actually go for six hundred because I feel that six hundred could be our answer just by looking at those 600 600 then that's going to be twelve hundred twelve thousand twelve hundred right then let's look at that's a twenty four so what do I get now I get seven eight two two three four zeros so this time if you look at you see almost twice bigger that's what we call optimization in company you guys gonna use all that sorry I got a little bit distracted explain it recap but I want to see that why we need to optimize because although I have the same length 2,400 feet but depending on what dimension you said it you Cleveland put so much more twice a month that you can actually put your animal there right because the area is it that much bigger so that's what we like to optimize in this case what will give me the largest area okay so now I'm not going to explain more details about I hope there you see the reason why we have to optimize and now how we're gonna find it that's the equation we actually write it as a on programming language basically over this whole my observation so why are they asking here in order to find largest area if I put this one out I know that my function is going to be quadratic function with concave down right this way so our largest means it's gonna happen at maximum how do we find maximum that happens at first derivative so we are going to take a derivative of area which is area derivative will give me this will be easier than using the on product look so let's do this one negative 4x plus 2400 and let's factor it out by negative four and now I get X my 600 uh-huh so from here if I say equal to zero to find them on critical value I see that X has to be 600 then we need to check that if this one is a maximum or minimum so if you graph this one you will see that 2400 and the slope is a negative 4 so this coordinate will be 600 right your Y intersects intercept is a 600 as it here says so what does it here say from critical point my first derivative left side is a decreasing and then I'm increasing lifestyle isn't first when I will get 430 tip this tell me that my original function is increasing and then after 600 it's going to be decreasing therefore my maximum is happening at 600 so Jana is this the same question to find him vertex yes so I found the my x value as a 6 which we actually found it by plugging numbers by so I got six hundred as one side then what will be the other sizes we have to find the dimension that gives me twelve hundred feet as a dimension gives us seventy seven hundred twenty thousand feet square as area maximum area yeah that's how we solve this one so this one was an appetizer so now we have a on same question I change the number so I wanted to practice at one time and then compare the answer with me okay class let's look at in class activity one and how did it go so this storm wasn't too bad right so I graph input was a side of the length and the area is output I want to find so my function has to be length times width this area sothanks times width in here then I took the derivative and then what they're saying is or what is the largest area so you have to see the input X output area largest area means when i graph it odd that represent a maximum value it has to be the vertex so with our prekow we can actually graph this one as a bird zero and then passing through 1800 if you factor it out by negative two you see that X minus 1800 and times X so I had two x-intercepts and if i graph it by symmetric i actually see the answer it has to be 900 right so i also want to verify with first derivative when i take the word first or the tip day i want to find critical point so i set equal to 0 then my critical point is going to be 900 so i have to see that what is this valuable connection or minimum so i check right here with a first derivative graphed the here says increasing decreasing so 900 has to be local maximum local maxima and therefore I got the proof that that's a maximum and by plugin 900 by 1,800 would give me max area over 1 million six hundred twenty thousand v square ok so that's the answer that's continuing class so now we gonna the main dish and let's look at the question he so we have a cylinder e-content is to be made to hold one liter of oil by the dimension that will minimize the cost of the metal too many bachelor they can so I want to actually give you some example here so class so I try to quickly prepare what I try to say so look at here I got three one two and three different kind of a cups and I filled up this one with the water and I want to see that if among those are three cups which one would be actually the biggest volume so let's compare so I'm going to put this water into next Cup and I didn't feel it completely so that I don't drink it on the ground and if I put this one as you see it's actually same volume and then if I pour this one to our two serving dish and if I point here let you see a drip summer but but also if it's here can I say that all these three have the same volume yes this one is actually eight ounce as a one cup so now Oman does a three among those are three cups which one will have this smallest surface because if you are the owner of the company then you want to actually make it biggest container we're using the smallest material right so this is a question we are going to talk about we have a 1 liter of oil and then I'm sorry that I was going to calculate the volume and then volume is eight ounce but I was going to calculate the surface area for you but I don't think in the really really exact form on those are three cases we saw those a three cups and then one of them will give me the max on minimum surface area which you wanna have small it's a surface or material that you wanna buy and then you want to maximize the volume that's why we try to find here so all these three cases are the same size as a 1 liter of oil just think about like that then depending on the radius though the surface area will change which we saw earlier use implies explain to you with the on farming area so just think about that example and then let's try to now see that what we need to figure here so what would be input if you cannot find the input then try to find what is the output what do you want to maximize what you want to optimize what do you want to minimize so if you use the minimum maximum that to optimization so here's that I want to minimize the cost of the metal so output will be cost of the metal how do we check the price price is going to be money times and then material I in this case we have to see they didn't actually tell us the amount so we are going to find the minimum area that will minimize our cost so you have to see hidden question is I cannot find the cost but if I find the minimum area minimum surface area that will minimize my cost here to find it so we are going to say our output is going to be the minimum area of a cylinder okay and then what do we need to send now input path this is a cylinder do we use XOR we are going to use our as radius of 10 so I'm going to set that as R and then we'll try to find minimum area of a cylinder so what can I do if I want to find the area of a cylinder I need to open the cylinder and the area of the surface will be open this way everybody see why it is shaped this one top part bottom part and then around the middle part so I want to find the area only information I know is this is R then what is the area with how part of the PI R square which is the same as the bottom part PI R square then what's the area of a middle rectangle well that length here is going to be same as my circumference of the circle so that's going to be 2 PI R and then why is this I don't know so I have to use this one as H as a height then that is going to be area 2 PI R H so the function day I want to find this area of a cylinder input these are so you can only use the art in here so look at I have a 2 PI R square adding it plus 2 pi RH but when you look at here this is a function but I cannot use the two variables you can use only one variable art but I have H so how can I get rid of the age H is going to be come from my height but do I know that volume yes so what is a volume of a cylinder when the radius is R and height is H so this is R and then height is H then always the volume is base times height so why does the base base is going to be PI R squared and what is a height H uh-huh so I got the volume is PI R square H but they were to give me what is that that's one later exactly so well I'm going to do is I'm going to replace that h value in terms of X that's I'm going to approach it soon but looky here I cannot still use this one yet because my units are different this is a leader but radius is going to be probably centimeter this one we have to use a centimeter why because one liter different unit we cannot use it we can change that into same Union one liter is the same as 1,000 square Q centimeters so here shows that PI R square H is 10 at 1,000 so if I solve for H if I solve for H I get 1,000 over PI R square so if I replace this one it substitute into this age then I can rewrite all my equation in terms of extra R so this will be you is Rudy by plugin by plugging in H here then that's only 2 PI R squared plus 2 pi R thousand over PI R squared and you see these cancel out this one can slap so it turned out to be simple 2 PI R squared plus 2 thousand over R that's what I get as my function that's why you want to put it as a function so when I look at this one I cannot have a more than one variable so if I say input are you have to change everything in terms of art right here okay no two variables so now we got the first derivative a regular function regular function which it is we are going to use this function and what is this that is a surface area so if I want to minimize I need to take a primitive so let me take a derivative here a derivative would be 4 PI R plus 2 minus 2,000 over R square I did everything mentally I did everything mentally so foci are closed - because that's arsenic it's 1 minus a 2 thousand over R square but I want to find critical point so equal to 0 then let's set up 4 PI R is equal to 2,000 over 4 PI R is equal to 2,000 over R square we can do cross multiply is my R cube is 2,000 over 4 PI multiplied divided by 4 PI so R is going to be cube root of 2000 over 4 PI that's the answer that's the answer and from here now we need to punch in that number so what will be 2000 divided by today 1/3 power it's me five point four one nine two that's my radius centimeter okay then from here we need to talk about a little bit more we need to talk about a little bit more so you know how can you verify that this is a minimum because I didn't verify it yet right so how do I verify this is minimum well then you need to see that the first targeted graph when you plug in five point one nine two that will make zero so we need to plug in five I'm going to plug in five quickly and it's going to be 5 into I'm doing test point five here and I'm going to plug in 6 here into here so that I can check my sign to 4 pi times 5 minus 2000 R square then that gives me negative seventeen point one six and I'm gonna do the same thing with plug in six so if you don't see the graph like how I explained then you Joseph from the critical point critical point plug in number one down number one bigger then I got negative 273.16 when I plug in six I got 19.8 for that already shows that my graph is gonna look like this way right Leggett so that's positive of a first 32 graph so ah this number is going to be decreasing increasing so I can say that that's local minima I need to still verifying part on your paper too so always try to plug in and then verify if you cannot find the graph so that's now minima then answer we did not answer yet because our value is at this when R is five point four one nine two then while this roof is area all we need to do is plug in here so let me use that number if you put in this number that would be perfect answer and if you put in this one it's gonna give me some wrong the answer right so two pi and I will just use a five point four one nine two okay then I got s550 3.58 that's a surface area so it's gonna be square centimeters okay so what does this mean what does this mean I want to say five point four five point four is about this much five point four and when you have a radius about this much so it's gonna be this much as a diameter and then if you about this much can when you make it you want to make radius as five point four then if you plug in this number to your art you're gonna get H value I believe that with my experience probably twice bigger so let me find my let me find the H value for users for fun so thousand divided by five point four one nine two exactly what I guess so I got ten point eight three eight seven so let me draw five centimeter is about this much so doubling it so my radius is about five point one four two and then it's used in my highness same length as your diameter right that's a ten point a four at the time you will have maximum you have biggest volume which is one meter with a small little surface area that's you want to spend about this much okay all right it's a little bit confusing right so I want to actually plug in and then see that what happened when I have five point full month or two I got area as a 550 3.58 there's a full fun I want to put two centimeter what if it is a two centimeter half not even half it's going to be about two centimeters so I'm gonna make it this then your surface area is going to be change although your volume is the same so I'm going to plug in tube in here into my surface area and what will give me as a minimum surface okay so if I plug in 2 I get actually thousand twenty five one three okay I want you to see the differences you see there if I have a radius five point four two you only need a 550 degree swerve it basically Roundy if you use a two centimeter then how much you have to use for surface 1025 you use it about twice more about twice more that means that as your factory owner or you are the CEO you don't want to see that right because that's totally wasting money of the same amount that you can hold it so that's why it's very important optimizing in the company because you can save twice among the money of your material so that's what we are doing but yeah all right this is still hard then I can I will show you with the decimals okay okay class so let's look at that smooth as you see the function over 2 pi x squared plus 2000 over X you know how do I know my answer is correct because that's the point you are looking for right before the calculus we cannot find any other function besides a quadratic and now you guys can so I punched in and then I just click that one do you guys see that five point four one nine gives me area 553 if it matches then yes you got the correct answer that's how you can check then earlier we also check with a to write how much the surface area will be when the input is 2 so if I plug in 2 here about to then do you say thousand 23 I don't know sorry I clicked it around here then that gives me same number about up here so also so you see how do I know depending on if you get even bigger radius that means that your surface area gets also worse again so what is the ideal size ideal size of the package usually as you stick this side this size about the same yeah so when you see this one this one is the same there would usually minimize the surface area pretty cool right so the answer is going to be when our value is five point four one nine two also you can write it this one and those ones you should be able to do without calculator or two here then you will get minimum surface area 553 I think about that only this much right ten centimeter by 10 centimeter so that's this much that is one meter so imagine one meter how much is one meter above real with this one it's probably one meter right so think about that of the amount okay so we will do one on in-class activities just similar question and then I want you to compare the answer with me okay so comfortable answer we need how did it go so say the input output the surface area then my surface area if I simplify in terms of everything are as you see in please are we cannot use H there so force to change in terms of our gave me this function so I took the derivative and then I say equal to zero to get critical point so my r-value turn out to be four point three or one three okay so when I plug in this R value gave me my surface the area as a three hundred forty eight point seven three four then again you're not want to check the answer is this really correct answer so you can always go back to here but I actually need to see all your work as well if you look at you see the four point three one comment three hundred forty eight point seven three four exactly so if you graph that's what you thought so let's conclude that earlier as mentioned if we have those are three different kinds of glasses what do you think that actually gave me the least amount of the surface area first one second one third one actually this case this one whenever you have a right proportion of this one this one will give me the smaller surface area although they hold this thing then when you see here I want you to also see that here to here if you reducing your radius in half then as you earn yourself your cost of making surface area could be twice more so if you see that can buy the coca-cola can I don't think okay this is not a candidate I tried to show you but do you guys remember those a coca-cola can why do they make that now I want how to mathematics to because if you make this one there will actually cost more if you make it this size it's definitely gonna fit with a death size it's gonna cost less that's why they made a coca-cola I can shape as a let's shape exactly because they calculated all these kind of a parts now another thing I want to talk about is a volume earlier we had a 1 liter now I have a half liter exactly half um another volume earlier we had a radius 5.3 will be maximum I remember about 5.30 say that so when I wasn't thinking oh my volume is going to be 1/2 then did you think that my radius has to be also 1/2 like 2.5 ish instead of 4.3 because when I saw this one I wasn't more guessing oh my answer I want to see about 2.5 but I support point 3 I was like whoa what happened because I didn't think ice is gonna be very close to 5 point 3 was the 5 point number we got earlier one why is that think about this way I have area as one if I'm gonna increase it twice then that side is 1 then my area is 1 but if I'm doubling it if I'm doubling it my length then it becomes area because of 4 if you double your side then your volume becomes actually eight times more because area is a four times volume is going to be eight times more so I want you to I want you to think about this time why I didn't get half over early over five point I fell five point three or five point one is your three sorry if I'm messing up but why it wasn't two point something - a 4.3 because now you have a half amount that means your length will be only 3/4 reduced basically I wanted to feel that if your length is inputting twice and then your area equals four times your volume increasing eight times that's what do they ship is this one is a centimeter to the volume relationship that's why they are going to be not half of the radius only quorum man will be reduced so think about that if you're not getting it so completing me so that's it implants activities and let's do dessert okay so let's start the dessert today is the most highlight part and it's gonna be one of the most difficult one so listen and then let's do it next activities and by yourself so that you can make it yours so a man launched this is both point a on the bank of this trip Weaver and three kilometers why three kilometers wide this is a three kilometers wide and then he wants to reach point B from point A and point B is a 9 kilometers downstream on the opposite side of the bank so this length is ninety meters and if she can roll about four kilometers per hour and he can run eight kilometers per hour where shoe heel and to reach he as soon as possible know what's going on is that he wants to cross the river he wants to cross the river then I want to see that how he can reach there so as you see there are three cases this question have to really squeeze a spot so I have a three cases one case is you can just go straight like this that's the first case second case is you can go this way and then third case will be what we were looking for let's just walk run about here and then take a boat through this way so there are three cases then let's try to read a question again what do we wanna find where should he learn to reach B as soon as possible so you have to read a question are we looking for distance are we going for rate or time what I like to find here I wanna where should be very should he be too rich yes as soon as possible do you see that this is a little bit tricky so my output as soon as possible what does that mean that's going to be true this time to this time when when I landing here so I can set this distance as X this distance as X right then before we get into green color we want to see that Y have to break into those three cases let me explain to you with third one second case first so what is the time time distance is equal to RT then time is the same as the distance over R so in order to find how long it takes to run 90 meters and crossing three kilometers we can see that the time is going to be input as time is going to be the distance is a 90 meter over why was his rate of running he can run about eight miles per hour and then he can roll about four miles per hour so time that he run here is an 9 kilometers over 8 plus now he has to go 3 kilometers with speed Y so if I add this one that's going to be 6 15 15 over 8 that gives me about 1 point 8 7 5 hours to get there then let's look at first case that's we go straight here that means you just roll your boat all the way so how do we find this distance we have to use a Pythagorean theorem right so 9 kilometers squared 3 kilometers squared so that's going to be 81 plus 9 is 90 so I gonna take square root of 90 gives me the distance of as 9.8 and for it so I got square root of 19 so this length is square root of 19 which is about nine point four eight six eight so if I want to find what is the time it takes to cross only using row the boat that's going to be square root of 90 divided by speed was both speed is four then it gives me two point three seven hours it's a lot longer right a lot longer so if you go this one definitely I'm not going to go that way because this is gonna be shorter than what you thought right this takes a 1.75 this one takes two point three seven hours then can we find is there any point users to lending so that I can get to there so I said that one is X and watch carefully why is it this length that's going to be 9 minus X that would be 9 minus X then let's try to calculate this part of the tiny tape so time taster while running on day along the water is gonna a total X amount over what's the time it takes that is going the speed is going to be a miles per hour plus because a tiny the distance over R and then now why is this distance what is this distance we have to find that distance that's going to be our Pythagorean theorem so 9 minus X square plus 3 square has to be this distance square therefore that distance will be split off 9 minus x squared plus 9 over the speed of crossing the water definitely slower than the land which is a point now do you guys recall that we learn how to take a derivative this mark right so if you look at the previous part and you will see this one answer you will see the answer here let me pull it if I can find the answer so class I haven't start the question yet but if you actually take a 32 which we'll learn about three point four point two if you take a derivatives that equal to zero and then solve for X then you will get your x value as a seven point two six eight what does that mean that means when this one when you run about seven point two six eight when you have about one point seven three to left then that will actually take about one point seven seven five hours do you see that which one would actually get there the fastest time oh definitely not this definitely not this then we have to find where I start taking boat and after you run about seven point two six eight meters then you can roll the boat to the other side will give me the minimum time which is one point seven by about 1 hour 45 minutes but you know why you didn't show me this one well let's hope put it this one how I want to do so we've set input as X by X this time was a distance from where you're starting to where you wanna take off but this time I'm going to switch my graph of x to a little bit off which means off but differently so it's still my question is saying I'm crossing the river and try to get there and this time instead we're setting X here I want to set X here why I wanted to see little differences if this is X then that's going to be 9 minus X and if I want to have this length as a 3 do you see that the diagonal will be only x squared plus 9 you see that your equation becomes a lot easier so what is the distance of the water to we're going to take off with 9 minus X and what's the distance you are going to take a boat that's going to be square root of x squared plus 9 from Pythagorean theorem then let's try to find a function at the time so time input output is X but I switch my X from this X to other one basically saying if I get the X subtract that X I will get the same answer so time means distance over rate so what is this distance square root of x squared plus 9 over what the rate is 4 plus you have to walk this much and when one this much with your way 8 ok basically this first day in question I just set the X other way around why did I do that because it will make it easier to take a derivative so let's take a derivative I hope they have a room I'm not sure so I have to squeeze it a lot so if I take order T to this one 1 over 2 and then I have that 1 over 4 before then 1 over 2 square root of X square plus 9 and chain rule 2x plus take a derivative that will be negative 1 8 do you see other 9 over 8 minus 1/8 X right so you can change the linear and then take a derivative so I get that that has to be equal to 0 pi so if I continue it's going to be 2x over a square root of x squared plus 9 has to be 1/8 then can I multiply a both side so those are gone now I have 2x over square root of x squared plus 9 equals 1 so let's do cross multiply that gives me 2x is equal to square root of x squared plus 9 square both sides that gives me 4 x squared is x squared plus 9 and that makes it 3 x squared equal to 9 X is equal to plus minus square root 3 but it has to be positive so I'm going to use only slow drop 3 which is 2 point 2 3 and at one point seven three two so square root 3 is about one point seven three two so now let's check if I set this one as X and I got that value as one point seven three two so subtract from nine then do you see that I get exactly same it's a seven point two six eight but you know why you don't put it that way well earlier when you're the four point two that's how your text will approach for me I will approach it this way and you see that my derivative is so much better so much easier and you know how do you check that this is your minimum same thing you have your point seven point two six now you can plug in here seven plug in here eight and if you graph it it will turn out this way then my graph is going to be concave up so original function is concave up so I can indicate that this value is going to be my okay then how you check same thing you just punch in two decimals and let's see if I can see that tell you if I punch the decimal do you say seven point two six eight and then that's the value I found so did we finish answering did we finish answering no I didn't answer yet but if I plug in this number either way so this case IVA X tells of square root three then you have to plug in your number to here to get the answer and if you use your functions that exit this side the derivative is going to be a little bit more challenging than the other one but you see that you get the same answer now if you plug in one point seven three two what you're gonna get as your answer staying answers one point seven seven five so I minimize the time it takes after you walk seven point two meters and then row the boats rests upon wool if you didn't mean mom time to get there it's pretty interesting right so I want you to understand and then your answer will be one point seven seven five hours as a minimum time okay so there's another question same one but that is different number so I want you to be careful but X just to try to see that what are you defining it it's hard to describe but if you graph it I will understand so you see that depending on where you stay at the life will be so much easier or harder good luck okay how's it going class so as I said you guys would keep everything on the last chapter one two three to do these questions and I wanted to feel that how beautiful it is how smart you are how wise you are to figure it out and I love calculus because it comes everything about math you learn in your life you put in here and then now it makes sense why you want this right so that's why for me optimization is a very powerful question you basically pick her twelve years to do questions like this so good job so compute the answer input X and we want to minimize the time always the hint is the shortest of still possible and those are the word so minimum time then time we write as a distance / way so I found all the distance and the only rate and then I just put it together pleasedon't sub-array plus the distance of array so that I can find the time of a together going to different segments then I get X to the seven point five one nine three earlier sorry I made a mistake as a kilometers but since the miles per hour all my unit has a miles so after you walk in 7.5 about taking on board will give you the minimum time so if you plug in but this time I change my X to this side then you see my distance of a rowing boat is going to be this and then you're running will be 10 minus X so as you use it distance over speed was a four distance over speed was a nine and I took the dhurbey to this one in some of the other one because you experience that that was all one harder you can do that way - nothing wrong with me then I found it it gives me two point four eight one so I subtract from ten it gave me seven point five one nine but we need to see how long it takes so I'm going to plug in and then you also need to plug in and tell me the time because that's what we want to figure out and as you use as earlier I show you this one this way will take longer although this will be shortest distance so if I plug in two three hours so it's nothing longer than earlier one because my distance is a little bit longer - so when you walk seven point five and then rowing the boat that total trip will make about two point two three hours two point two three hours okay so this is it and then we are having a part two so part two will be I'm going to set up up to here and then you guys gonna do the derivative and then upload it so with next four questions keep playing with me kid playing math with me then when you do more you will get better", "2zGhfoZot5o": "hey everyone its Daphne from scrapping create and I'm back to continue working on the graphic 45 dreamland mini-album and we are onto page two so with that I'm going to set aside the cover and h2 is pretty simple especially if you're used to making mini albums it's a waterfall page and I'm actually going to apply the waterfall to the top of this mat and then this is the flap so the waterfall is gonna go like so and it's gonna open to the left and then this is going to be an arm that comes across with a magnet in it that holds everything in place so this strip is gonna get attached directly to the pocket page then we'll apply the mat and then the rest of the waterfall features will be applied to the top of the mat so this is the only thing going on directly on to the pocket page and this is 1 and 5/8 by 6 inches 1 and 5/8 by 6 inches and I've scored 1/2 inch on the 6-inch side and I came up with that because this is one of the cut aparts from the signature page and that was just the perfect size to mat this so I want to use that as sort of the arm that holds everything in place on the waterfall so that's where I came up with the size trimmed it down to fit this particular cut apart so with that let's go ahead and get started so the the waterfall feature like I mentioned is going to be in a portrait it's going to open this way and then the arms going to come over this top this side so I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to Center these waterfalls on the mat and I want to Center this over on the edge toward the spine on the on the page too so sit down and do that get some tape on here get this down again 1 in 5 8 by 6 score at half inch on the 6-inch side pick tool okay that's it so again we're applying it to the spine side so here's the pocket side the spine side and I'm just gonna Center it and I am gonna use my grid line here on my craft mat to help me Center it and I'm just eyeballing so I'm putting the middle of this flap at the 4 inch 4 inch line all right all right that's good okay that's in so the next thing we're gonna do is dry fit this real quick make sure it's gonna be right and it is okay so I'm not gonna make this mistake I made in page one I'm gonna get my magnets down before I put my base in so we are going to apply a magnet to the top of of this this arm that's gonna be the closure to hold it in place and I'm not going to place the adhering magnet on this side because I'm gonna have a mat and then I'm going to have several of these waterfall features on top of it so I think that's too many layers to go through so I'm gonna actually wind up applying the mate to it on the top waterfall feature and you'll see what I mean in a minute if I can get the tape off okay so now as far as placement on on here I just want to get it far enough away from all three of the edges that there's no issue and I also want to get an estimate of where this is gonna be so I put a reference line here and it's just about one inch in from the edge of the mat I just I think it's actually one and 1/8 if you want to follow what I'm doing and I'm gonna fold this over so I want to make eye the only reason I was doing this is I want to make sure that wherever I put the magnet was actually gonna land on there so I've got plenty of space so I'm gonna set down about here that's close enough press that into place and I'm gonna get some tape on it just soften the edges and I'm running out of tape or fat tape anyway okay that's in so now as I had mentioned everything else is gonna get actually adhere to this mat so I have a couple of references I've done here from earlier that I'm gonna erase I had originally thought about floating this fastener on top of the mat and I changed my mind I changed my mind so this is actually ready to go in and then again I've got a reference line one in 1/8 inch here and that's where I'm gonna lay down my first waterfall feature but first let's get this in beautiful okay and I do have tape on these so this should go pretty quickly and then we'll get back to the designer papers little bumpy from the other side okay so alright oh I need to give you these measurements so this is 4 & 5 8 by 6 & 1 8 4 & 5 8 by 6 7 1 8 and on the 4 & 5 8 inch side you're going to score so at the end you're going to have a four and one-eighth by 6 and 1/8 panel and that size comes from the graphic 45 that ephemeral journaling cards are 4 by 6 so I just wanted to give it a little bit of a mat so that is where that size comes from alright so again I moved in and put a reference line at 1 and 1/8 and now I'm looking to just Center this from top to bottom and I'm not even going to measure I'm just gonna eyeball it now once you get your first one in everything else is easy because you're just gonna bump off the pre-existing hinge so the next one goes right here so really that one reference line is all you're gonna need to worry about and then I'll come up clean the edges up when I'm finished okay I'm going to turn it side so I can get a better view gotta keep that down so the one thing you do want to make sure is that your panels are not skewing so I'm going to get a straight edge out here and I'm I'm mostly concerned about this the top staying flush so I'm going to lay the panel in and use the ruler to help me keep the edge straight okay cuz I think your eye will be drawn to the top of the waterfall okay we're gonna do another one same thing last one so there's a total of four okay so those are in so again it's 4 & 5 8 by 6 & 1 8 they're gonna score 1/2 inch on the 4 and 5/8 inch side so the next thing we're ready to do now is to locate the magnet on the opposing side and then let's see do I have a plus or minus I already covered it up so I'm not sure it should be a plus yep that is correct these pages are always so easy to put together waterfalls are and they're so impressive given the easy they seem much more complicated but it's pretty straightforward design feature I accidentally threw one of my rulers away okay no I'm just gonna lay this over and find its mate mating location and get some tape over it okay and then that should hold everything nice and neat and as you can see the waterfall feature is actually centered on the page okay so what I had done is I had laid all my waterfall out and measured it and then figured out what the offset would be and that's where that first reference line came from but they look beautiful even when they're offset so I don't worry too much about that I don't always in fact a lot of times if you're not going to be precise it's better to go off center than to look like you're trying to be on center and not do it correctly all right so here's the cut apart from the cover or the signature page of the collection so that's gonna go right here on top I'm going to go ahead and glue that down so don't lose it or damage it beautiful and there you go doesn't that look pretty pretty pretty okay so the flip side is gonna be this blue paper and I'm pretty sure this is taught by 12 but it's really just find a piece of scrap that'll fit here and coordinate with the other side I didn't trim it out specifically for this it was a piece of scrap left over that I found that would work now if you are using this take a look for the moon because the moon does have an orientation and make sure you put it in the right side up there is no moon on this particular piece of scrap so I don't have to worry about it oops a little heavy-handed on the glue it's bleeding out here and you want to make sure you're pressing all the way around your magnet so that you don't have a bubble cuz it's really not very wide what's the other reason why I always put tape on top of the magnet okay that looks good okay alright now we're ready to lay the designer paper on to the bar fault so and I want to show you what I've done if you want to do the same thing or use the same papers I found this pattern which I really like and I knew that I wanted him and the ship to be the main element of the front panel now you could have made it this guy too either one but what I had done is I figured out this is a four by six panel so that's what this is four by six and then I added an inch for each one of the waterfalls that's going to be so this is this is four five six seven so get something that's seven inches by six inches and then slice one inch off each edge and that way you get this cascade image cascade up the image directly on your antenna contrived I skip a page no there we go directly on your waterfall and there we go so that's how that's gonna look once I get it all installed and I just realized something I did one inch strips I should have been 1/2 inch strips but be that as it may it's still gonna have a continuation of the pattern as we go to lay it down in the book and so that'll be one side and the flip side I just did something a little bit more simple solid pages but because I'm using a strip here I've got some leftovers so I'm going to use this yellow paper here okay so I'm going to set these aside we're gonna get the first one in the top one and then we'll work on the balance before we take that off I'm gonna drive it did something behind it yes it looks good somebody asked me on YouTube and this comes up off and on why do I use tape on some parts and glue on others and the reason I do that one is well there's a couple reasons but anything that's interactive like a hinge where things are gonna move around a lot or have I'm joining two pieces of paper and there's some kind of a hinge like even the pocket page I want to use tape because tape remains flexible our glitter glue does a good job of remaining flexible but not like tape there's just no really no replacement for the tape and then I use glue on any of the pieces that are just being adhered to a flat piece and there's no hinge no score line or anything like that and a big reason why I use the glue is one is much much faster as you've probably seen and experienced for yourself it's also much more economical than using tape to put everything down if money and time were no issue I would use tape on everything it is I think the most permanent and it's also the most forgiving if you have an issue there's a product called undo that you can use to actually lift your tape up if you have a problem with your glue you're committed you really can't undo it unless you catch your mistake like I did in on page one immediately so you can't there's no do-overs with glue to speak of if you don't catch it you know within the first few minutes you're committed with tape you can come back the next day and use this undo product and you know take it take it off and in fact if you use the undo and you let both the designer paper and the paper you removed it from dry completely they're both you can use both nothing gets wasted so again if time and money were no we're not a consideration I probably put tape on everything but if and I've done that on some of my early videos and it takes forever so these four out of four hour videos get even longer I know it's not just a single video but I mean for a whole tutorial four hours is a large investment to be watching and I don't think anybody really wants to watch me take down so anyways that's my explanation that's why I do it the way I do it I'm sure other people have different reasons but that's mine and I think it would be kind of expensive to do tape on everything but like I said it is it will stand the test of time I've never had score tape fail I've had double sided tape fail not squirting that brand in particular and I've had glue not art glitter glue but other glues fail where they dry and get brittle that's why I think it's important to use good adhesives you're spending a lot of money on the paper you want it to last especially if you're using it for photo albums which you know in theory can't get passed on ok so there's sort of my continuation of the pattern and like I said it's not exactly right because this should have been a half inch strip instead of an inch strip so if you're watching this maybe you can learn for my lesson either that or I could have done a one inch score line and that would have just shifted everything over one inch instead of a half inch okay now I'm gonna go ahead and dry fit and add these these pieces to cover the rest of the panel and then we will cover the flip side that's pretty much all of page two pretty simple so page two is also going to be the same as page seven so I'm doing a symmetrical album here I don't I haven't sometimes with stamp areia I don't do that but with graphic 45 a usually do 1 2 3 4 4 3 2 1 so 4 & 5 are just mirror images of each other trying to make sure I am completely off the hinge area so that it'll operate freely the base this orange based paper is I can't tell you I I can't remember if it's from the 12 by 12 or the patterns in solids but it's not 8 by 8 I can tell you that so it's either from patterns and solids or from the 12 by 12 collection pack and the yellows are from the all of these are from patterns and solids okay and as you can see this is the same as that and this is from the 8 by 8 so this must be a 12 by 12 so this is from the 8 by 8 collection which is just a slightly smaller pattern then the then what's here on the base I'm keeping these very simple because the flap itself is the size of a photo so if you just trim a little bit off your photo then you're gonna get a nice little border by contrast paper I didn't tell you the size of this but typically what's inside it'd a one inch strip here I'll usually lay it down and then mark it before I trim it but I can tell you this is three inches but you're gonna want to dry fit it so that you get this uniform seem otherwise join the two like I've shown you in previous videos with tape behind it and then trim the whole thing down to a four by six so there's two different approaches or solid piece like this which is a four by six it's our last piece okay so for now I'm not gonna cover the hinge but I may come back and add something to the hinge after I've gotten when I'm in the Abele's embellishment phase depending on what's left over I might try to find something to cover up the black because it's pretty pretty pronounced but I'm not sure yet so we'll see what's left and then as you can see I'm struggling a little bit with this panel it's because I actually probably should have taken a sliver off because it's falling into the hinge and it's making the paper want to peel back so I'm just gonna try to work this into place so that I can keep the paper from trying to fold back but something to be aware of when you're laying yours down stop and check and make sure that it still wants to operate freely and not get caught in the hinge so I'll probably have to add a little bit more glue here and then just work it in with my bone folder to keep it in place so that it doesn't want to peel back okay so there you go that is the end of page 2 I hope everybody enjoyed I know that one a lot faster than page one so I feel like I'm getting my flow back but also this is a fairly easy page so thanks everybody for tuning in next time my back will be working on page 3 thanks bye", "gQc0WMfjKYg": "good morning today i am going to work on a canteen cord that is set up like a light and this was a leftover from a project i had started in the class and i forget why i never did it i can't even remember but i do know that the first thing i want to do is make sure it's nice and smooth and i'm looking for a design what i want to put i want to put holiday design on one side and something more spring-like on the other so someone could display it in either season and since i'm not the one who drilled the holes i need to make sure that it's actually level when it sits down i set the cord like this on my workstation and i think that the hole is a little bit off to one side so what i'm going to do is i'm going to take some 40 grit sandpaper and i'm just going to sand on the one side and try and level it up and then i'll use a sanding block to make sure that my leveling is level so i need to take a little bit more up here [Music] okay now it looks level but i'm not sure if the bottom of it is absolutely level so i'm going to use the sanding block i can still see kind of a dip here so i'm going to work on it some more don't okay now that should be pretty flat and i'm not sure how i'm going to finish this off i need to look for some ideas on what's the best thing to do there kind of just want to clean that up a little bit [Music] i haven't decided if i'm going to cut something for it to sit on or just how i want to do that but it is now very very flat no gaps um this hole was a little bit ragged and i sanded it and it might be a little bit too big for the lamp but the lamps are coming in a couple days and since i'm going to use both sides i'm going to have to cut this off and sand that down i'll save the stem in case i need to use it for another project okay this is a 40 grit sandpaper this i think is might be more like 20 and this is even finer this is from a band song and it was just some leftovers and i'm going to go over the whole cord and really try and smooth it okay so i think i've got the gourd pretty smooth it's in pretty good shape and looking over here i don't know if you can see this but i see something i think i would like to try i think i'd like to try and do a swirl and some leaves and now that i've got that new bit and the bit for taking this off this is very different because you've got a solid part here and then it's more carved out beyond it this is way different than anything i've done so i think i'm actually going to use this as an inspiration piece and try and do something like that that is so attractive in fact i might i might try to do exactly that just to see if i can use those two new bits to do this and this i'm going to use the um to do the leaves i'll use that filigree bit and then to do the inside here this is a stipple though to do that inside i'll use that saber tooth and that should be for this side and then for the other side i need to find something more holiday okay so your eyes did not did not trick you i'm using a nail file with four different sides to do some final i just want to see how smooth each side is and if there's an area that's a little bit rougher that i need to plan for that area to be the part that's cut out or stippled and if there's a part that's just especially gorgeous and smooth that i need to preserve to use for the swath on this design i have ordered a vacuum a handheld little tiny vacuum with batteries so that i can just vacuum around here because otherwise we're using a shop vac a humongous shop pack or we've got some robot vacuums so i can't wait for the little vacuum to arrive because i can just tidy up this area i don't mind doing hand sanding inside i don't even wear a mask since it just all falls down but if i'm doing a lot of staining i go outside so time to make lunch i'll see you in a minute okay here's the confession i went back over the score two more times with the same process with using the very fine sandpaper this one at all and then using uh this it's a deep sea cosmetics i think i could pick one up at the dollar tree one of these and now it's going just feels like so it feels like butter it's so smooth and i can't say i won't do it again because i love it when they just end up that smooth but now what's happened is i've made it really hard to choose which side to put the designs on because they don't want to cut any of it because it's so nice and smooth [Music] you", "1N0wdUdv_Pc": "which is greater we have two fractions one for two thirds the numerator of this fraction is 1 the denominator is 4 the numerator here is 2 the denominator is 3 in order to find which is greater you need to find the lowest common denominator or any common denominator at this point whatever is the same denominator 4 times 1 you need you from your multiplication table 4 times 1 is 4 4 times 2 is 8 4 times 3 is 12 4 times 4 is 16 let's look at this fraction now 3 times 1 is 3 3 times 2 is 6 3 times 3 is 9 3 times 4 is 12 let's stop there and see if we have a same number same here and here and we do we have 12 so we now know the common denominator is 12 now to see which fraction is greater let's work on the numerators on this fraction 4 times 1 gave us 4 4 times 2 gave us 8 4 times 3 gave us 12 4 times 3 is 12 what you did to the denominator you must do to the numerator so then that's 1 times 3 if we did 4 times 3 it's 1 times 3 which is 3 let's look at this fraction 3 times 1 is 3 3 times 2 is 6 3 times 3 is 9 and 3 times 4 gave us 12 3 times 4 gave us 12 what we do to the denominator we must do to the numerator also multiply it by 4 and 2 times 4 is 8 therefore H is larger than 3 8 is greater than 3 so our original question 2/3 is greater than 1 over 4", "4lAHtC4rBaQ": "welcome to just a spoonful of sugar my name is Melissa and I'm so excited you're here now the purpose of this show is to show you some really great recipes that you can make at home with your children for all of those social events and bake sales that you as parents are always being asked to attend today we are making an amazing chocolaty treat it's called Mississippi mud cake now I was born on vacation and not just Mississippi so we're going back to my roots with this tasty chocolaty treat so we're starting off here by putting the melted butter into the bowl we'll add our two cups of sugar right on it and our four lightly beaten eggs right inside there and half a cup of cocoa as well as an eighth of a teaspoon of salt and one teaspoon of vanilla I don't know why but I always want to add a little bit more than one teaspoon of vanilla so I always let it overflow so we're whisking that together and then when we get done doing that we will add in our flour and our pecans in a minute all the ingredients together come on over here and take a look we have it all together now I'm just going to add my flour so the very simple recipe as I said that you can make with your kids and then you just stir it and when it's smooth you're going to put it in an oven with 350 degrees and a 15 by 10 jelly pan that is greased and floured so I'm gonna mix this up and then we're gonna see what happens next okay so we've mixed all of our ingredients together one bowl that's all it takes one bowl we like that and we're going to spread it evenly into our baking dish now when I put the butter in early I did want to tell you a little tip that my mama always tells me is that to make a really moist cake you should use one stick of butter and one stick of margarine and the combo between really makes a nice moist cake so I don't know why but I always like to listen to what my mama says so that's what we're doing you can just use 2 cup or two sticks of butter if that's what you prefer so I'm spreading this out nice and evenly in my pan and I'm going to put it in the oven at 350 degrees it's already preheated and I'm gonna leave it in there for about 20 to 25 minute now I am by no means a professional chef or Baker but I just love baking so I'm trying to share this with you and show you easy fun things that you can do with your kids to share memories okay and it goes and I'll see you back here in about 25 minutes 20 minutes has gone by and that house smells amazing go ahead and bring this puppy out oh this is chocolate heaven next thing we do is bring out any marshmallows that you want whole bag though of 10.5 ounces you're gonna sprinkle them on top as evenly as you can you can see that I'm getting them into the stove because that's what real people do when they're cooking they mess it up now we have our pan full of chocolate goodness with marshmallows we're gonna put it back in the oven at 350 degrees like me having before and five minutes bring it out and we're gonna put the icing on top so I'll be right back in just a second for us to do icing now we're back to my absolute most favorite part about this recipe so I've seen oh my gosh now it's a good thing that you're here with me today because I cannot be Justin alone with too many sweet things so we're gonna start off here with 1/4 of a cup of softened butter then we've got 1/3 of a cup of cocoa we have a a cup of milk or soy milk whichever you prefer you can also substitute of course that butter for Earth Balance as well and then I have a 16 ounce package of powdered sugar now I'm using organic powdered sugar so it's really really important that you sift it so we don't have any lumps and chunks inside there now we're gonna take this we're gonna blend it all together and when we come back the Mississippi mud cake will almost be done okay so we made the icing as you can see it isn't just thick as a normal icing that you would make for a cake and that's because we want to be able to drizzle the chocolate on top of the marshmallows once the recipe comes out of the oven okay here we go come and see this beauty oh my gosh melted marshmallows what a dream our icing mixture that we made just a few minutes ago and we want to drizzle it all on top of the mixture and you're just gonna keep on Jerusalem until you use up all the chocolate and we'll see you in just a moment once I finish this up now the chocolate has been drizzled and as you can see we have this beautiful Mississippi mud cake now as the title suggests it looks a little like mud now the trick here is to let it cool completely before cutting into it now I know how hard that's gonna be if you weren't here right now a little corner would already be missing and after we've let them cool completely you cut them up into squares I made about 30 pieces here today a couple of them are missing off the tray at the moment as you can see they look amazing they look muddy as the recipe suggests and very appetizing I'll be taking this to a Halloween party later today I'm thinking about booties a little Jem's on top those candy corn pumpkins but I'm not quite sure yet if I'm gonna do that that's it Mississippi mud cake an easy recipe now you're supposed to wait till it completely cools before you cut them up but I can tell you if you want a nice warm treat just take your fork and Diggle we'll see you next time on just a spoonful of sugar I'm Melissa and I'm excited", "AW5sPYJ5LkI": "okay in this video we'll be looking at exercise 19 from your lecture notes module 3 all right so we'll start with the this differential equation x squared minus 1 y double prime plus XY prime minus y equal to 0 here clearly X equal to 0 is an ordinary point so I could easily use this as my initial guess I find the first derivative I find the second derivative these are pretty standard operations at this point then I will multiply my second derivative with x squared which I gives me that 1 and then minus 1 times y double prime which gives me that 1 plus X Y prime which I multiply X to Y prime that gives me that 1 and then minus y itself which is that now the first move here is to see the powers of X for each starting in the indices so for the first one if I put 2 in the place of N or the power of X will be x squared second one if I put 2 for the for N in the power of X it gets to the zero here will be X to the 1 here will be X to the 0 all right well that means we keep this one we take two terms out of this one you take one term out of this one and we take two terms out of this because remember they all have to stop at the same power of X and you always want to match the highest power so well write the first one as is - and here I'm going to take out two terms so the first N equals two so B 2 times 2 minus 1 is 1 a 2 x ^ 0 and then I take one more ounce of - n times n minus 1 this time is n is 3 sorry right that is constant so sorry I'm I'm taking out 3 so be 3 times 3 minus 1 a 3 X to the power of 3 minus 2 which is 1 - then I'll write the rest of it so I took out n is equal to 2 I took out n is equal to 3 now I go to N is equal to 4 to infinity and I write it as is and minus 2 and then for the next one for this one I'll take out one term so we'll be plus when n is equal to 1 to get a 1 X to the 1 + the rest which n is equal to 2n a and X to the N and then the last one I have to take out two terms so minus a naught X to the 0 minus a 1 X to the 1 minus a n X to the N as n goes from I took 0 I took one so it goes from 2 to infinity equal to 0 so now I need to take all the constant non power series terms so I take that one that one that one that one and that one I'm gonna write that in yellow so now give me start with the -2 a 2 X to the 0 - 3 times 2 a 3 X to the 1 no so that's gone that's gone then it's that one so plus a 1 X to the 1 that one's gone - a naught X to the 0 minus a 1 X to the 1 so that's all the non power series terms and then I'll write the power series sense but for now let me just clean that up a tad bit so that we don't forget you need to still take that take that take that and take that and write them all together instead of equal to zero as well so that has to be zero okay and so let's clean that up so you get minus 2 a 2 X to the 0 minus 6 a 3 X a 1 X and minus a 1 X go away minus a naught X to the 0 equals 0 has to equal 0 so here I could combine the powers of X with their coefficients so I have negative 2 a 2 minus a naught X to the power of 0 minus 6 a 3 X equal to 0 so from here I can I could see that minus 2 a 2 minus a naught is equal to 0 that's minus 2 a 2 is equal to a naught so a 2 is equal to minus 1/2 e naught and from here if I say negative 6 a 3 is equal to zero because that's the coefficient of x and the only way it could be 0 is for the coefficient to be 0 so that just means that a 3 all right so I have my a 2 which is equal to minus 1/2 a nod and then I have a 3 which is 0 all right so now I write the power series terms so I'll have the summation of n times n minus 1 a and X to the N as n goes from 2 to infinity and then minus the other power series n times n minus 1 a n X to the N minus 2 as n goes from 4 to infinity plus n a n X to the N as n goes from 2 to infinity minus a n X to the N as n goes from 2 to infinity and that has to equal to 0 okay so now remember in order for me to combine these power series they all have to have the same starting index and the same power well you notice the first one this one and this one they all have the same index and same power so I'm hoping that if I can just go to the second one and take that and increase it by two units okay you matches the powers and then that means I have to decrease this by doing two units that will bring it to two it yeah that works so all I have to do is decrease or by two and increase the argument by two and we're good so I'll write it again and and minus one a n X to the N and from two to infinity minus N equals 2 to infinity sideloading and X by two I increase the argument by two so n plus two and plus one a and plus two x to the power of n plus and I'll just rewrite the rest of it equal to 0.so okay so now all my indices are the same all my powers are the same so thank God then I could combine the whole thing into one power series so I have n is equal to 2 to infinity of the N times n minus 1 a n minus n plus 2 times n plus 1 a n plus 2 plus and a n minus a n and all that is X to the power of n equal to 0 now again the only way this could be 0 is for all that to be equal to 0 so I need to try to find out for different values of n set that equal to 0 and for different values of n try to find out all the confidence I need so I can have the solution to my differential equation so I already have two of them solved for here so don't forget so you have that two pieces of information and then the rest you're gonna get from here so I will have to solve this for the highest in subscript 4 n 4 4 a so if I have minus n plus 2 and plus 1 a n plus 2 equals 2 and I move all the other ones to the other side so since that's all that is equal to 0 or has to be equal to 0 so I have minus and a n plus a knod minus n times n minus 1 and sorry that's not a not that's a in that's right hey in my hand I just had to write that as that looks like there you go so now I just divide everything by the coefficient of a n minus 2 and I can clean up the right side as well so my a n plus 2 will be if I write a fraction line here so I have minus n plus 1 minus n times n minus 1 right and then multiplied by a n and all that is divided by n plus 2 and plus 1 with a minus so and plus 2 will be if I clean this up here on the side I have minus n plus 1 minus N squared plus n minus N and plus and go away so you end up with 1 minus N squared so here you have 1 minus N 1 plus n times a n over minus n plus 2 and plus 1 now I can clean that up even further so that will be a n plus 2 is equal to well these two go away and then the other one is 1 minus n over minus n plus 2 so do you get you get n minus 1 over n plus 2 oh yeah do you see that because because 1 minus n could be if you factor out a minus could be written as n minus 1 right so then the minus will cancel out with the minus at the bottom and that's what you would end up so here is your recursive relation there and I'm gonna use this equation to find the rest of my constants now don't forget I'm gonna actually you know what I'm gonna take these well I'm gonna take these to college I'm gonna take these two right here and I'm gonna say copy and I'm going to paste them here because I need to use them too I need to use them very enough to be able to find all the other constants alright so here my constants okay so now I have this and remember what is it we need to do because people whose side of that when they get to this point we need to find our solution now what is our solution our solution is a naught plus a 1 X plus a 2 x squared plus a 3 X cubed plus a 4 X to the fourth plus 1/5 X to the fifth plus a 6 X to the 6 and so now you notice for me to find the solution what is it I need to have I need to have a nod I need to have a 1 and you have a 2 I need to have a III so I need to have all my constants so that I can have my solutions and the way I'm gonna find these constants is to use equation 1 equation 2 in equation 3 I don't have to use these three facts or relationships so I could find all the cut okay so let's see I already know what a 2 is it's what minus 1/2 a nod I know what a 3 is 0 so if n is equal to 2 I'll have a 4 equals 2 minus 1 over 2 plus 2 a 2 ok 2 minus 1 is 1 2 plus 2 is 4 a 2 is minus 1/2 a non so I'll get equals 2 minus 1/8 a not okay I'll let you look at that okay so my a4 is minus 180 not my a3 is 0 and my a2 is minus 1/2 a not ok so now let's see the next one n is equal to 3 so that will give me a 5 and remember I'm going I'm taking this value and I'm going on here that's where I'm going Oh case you didn't see that so continuing so a 5 will be that means I have to take 3 and put it in the place a tends to be 3 minus 1 over 3 plus 2 a 3 and that's just so 3 minus so we can write it anyways 3 minus 1 is 2 over 5 then a 3 is 0 times 0 so that gives me 0 so if n is equal to 4 I get a 6 equals well you see if you see the pattern you don't have to keep going to the top equation trying to see what you're gonna get just look at a pattern you start with 2 minus 1 and 3 minus 1 so obviously this will be what 4-1 yeah and then here you have 2 plus 2 3 plus 2 this would be 4 plus 2 and here you go from a 3 a 2 to a 3 so obviously this will be a 4 so it's kind of easy to see the pattern once you get into the groove of it so this becomes what 3 over 6 a 4 but what is a 4 a 4 is minus 1/8 a not okay all right so 3 & 6 reduced to a 2 so you get minus 1 over 16 a naught okay so let's see what we can do with these so it looks like everything is in terms of a nod and I don't see a 1 so obviously that must be my other constant so let me just take this up so I could write what everything is here so my solution will be and I'm gonna rewrite it in general first a 1 X plus a 2x squared plus 8/3 X to the fourth plus a 4x to the fifth plus hey sorry ain't not everyone x8 2x squared X sorry slow down a little bit and make 3x cubed a 4 X to the 4 a 5 X to the 5 so on so now I have so my Y is equal to a naught ain't not just a nod a one is just a 1 now what's a 2 a 2 is minus 1/2 a not so B minus 1/2 a naught x squared that's a 2 now we're on a 3 so a 3 0 so plus 0 X to the third now we're on a 4 plus what's a 4 a 4 is minus 1/8 a nod so we X to the fourth okay now we're on a fifth so 8 v is 0 so plus 0 X to the fifth and then plus AC a sixth is minus 1 16 a naught X to the sixth plus so on so there we go so we have everything we need let me magnify it a bit more so that's where we are so now if you just combine like terms and make it a bit simpler so this becomes y is equal to a nod so that's gone and then I'm gonna write the other a not turn so ain't not I'm gonna take that so minus 1/2 a naught x squared so that's gone my next ain't naught is that 1 so minus 1/8 a naught X to the fourth so that one's gone and then let's see what are they not I have it in that one which is minus 1 16 a naught X to the sixth so that's that one and that's all the terms I have for a nod all right now the rest of the terms is 0 except that one so you get plus dot dot plus monix so you could then clearly see here that your solution if i factor out an a not I get 1 minus 1/2 x squared right minus 1/8 X to the fourth minus 1 16 X to the sixth minus da close parentheses plus a1x and you kind of were expecting that anyways because it's a second order differential equation right so if you have a second order differential equation then you're expecting two solutions with two constants so you were expecting something like c1 y1 plus c2 y2 as a solution you see it here because like your c1 is represented with a nod your y1 is represented by this infinite power series your your a your c2 is representing your your a1 is representing c2 and the second function is just the next you don't you don't always have to give to power series sometimes you just get a closed form or or as a simple elementary function for either one of them at any given time so that will be the solution", "ntsZtbvnOGc": "[Music] hey friends welcome to a very special episode of purple onion kitchen today we have a very special guest joining us it's my favorite gal pal Lauren and she makes the most delicious peanut butter treats I have ever tasted they're called peanut butter delight and it's got chocolate chips peanut butter peanut butter cookies had a slew of

Girl but when I started working through it and writing it down and carrying on it's not really like hers and just part of it so I got the idea from her and I'm just kind of making it my own I got my pan preheating over here and I add just a touch of ever cut it off now I have here what I know to be more vegetables than I need but I'm gonna put the rest in the fridge for something I'm gonna do later and you'll see that at some point now the rest of the green pepper I will actually eat bell peppers so I saved that for myself I know shocker this is half of an 8 ounce package of mushrooms so I'm gonna use half of that so that'll be 1/4 of the package now this will cut down and go inside the mix in with the hamburger meat this is the half a million and half of a green pepper some won't take a quarter of that a quarter of the pepper and quarter the onion present smart will be too much for that time to meet but if it is we can add a little bit in time and I can still say that even though it's cooked now I'll let that go I'll put you on hold a second I'm gonna bring all this stuff I have in the size my sentence I'm gonna drag it over here go ahead and start working on the next time how are you now my god everything else that goes in the burners slid over this place we start on that now I am using a pound of the nicest percent ground beef if you want to save points you can make it your turkey I imagine chicken too but you know me and the B there will be some clubs right here a little bit I'm sorry I'm a funny I'm Stern line vegetable we just want to salt the mom and kind of wheel come down we don't want them crunching why I don't even definitely do the texture if you like now what does next she just ketchup I'm gonna use tomato sauce because when I make my own pizza sauce tomato I'm gonna go with her season is except I'm gonna add onion powder because I think it'd be good so we're gonna start with just 1 teaspoon of garlic powder now what I have in there already is a little bit of sugar because anytime I use can tomato products I always add a dash of sugar so I didn't even measure if I just scoop some in there it's not like I'm gonna count really good mattress it's maybe a teaspoon I have to teach man I'm gonna do it power let me stir again smells awful good it smells like a pizza pumping because that's the the idea here are those are toppings that you would put on pizza so the next thing is basil we'll do a half teaspoon back and then also a half teaspoon of oregano little bit of salt and pepper this is no salt added tomato sauce so we're not and salt the salt but I want to mix it in I don't even know how she did it cuz I'm really bad about not completely reading through a recipe it's just I was doing it myself I don't reckon it matters but I think when you add seasonings like to a meatloaf or something epigrams nature I think it's better if you mix them first that way you don't have like little awesome say like just pure of garlic you can sprinkle it in it doesn't get mixed around them I've seen them people on TV then can't see chefs and they just throwing it spices here than the other and then they for times sake you know on their show they don't stir it in yeah it's just like that drives me insane I don't know if it bothers y'all but I just like I want them to stop and stir even though I know in real life they probably would it's just oh okay take it now let's say I'm fresh you got another little bowl now I'm gonna use 1/4 cup of the tomato sauce oh you say no lord have mercy maybe it's something least it wasn't on my shirt course I better not speak to not speak too soon well I think those are dying so let me back off a minute to them tomato sauce I might add the seasonings and it's gonna be strong without even tasting on the plate it's gonna be strong but this is got to blend out all the weight in a pound of hamburger oh that's good mm-hmm I believe it didn't need that onion powder now I'm not sticking my hands in here right here chop it up a little bit and in you see how the much that cut down so I think that was a good amount for a pound of burger because we don't want it so loose that the burgers not gonna stick together we don't want like a meatloaf patty falling apart you know what I mean I hope it's gonna be okay how is it working well she works like a scram just make some food I said well I'm trying this here pizza burger Davis still on the road you know I said we can't eat our phone if you want to eat okay so yeah I was thinking what was I gonna eat so he said sounds interesting so he went ahead made him some pot stickers for an appetizer in anticipation of having a pizza burger later then we're just going to add in our see you tomato sauce and y'all feel free to dig your hands down in your hamburger because if you have watched me you know I can't stand it so I just don't I forgot to get my voice out so y'all just have to hold on a minute okay got my gloves on got my rain video tough we're both here that has seen better days we're just like this one way and iron hamburger we know I'm gonna make four four ounce patties and even though there are beets puppy a little bit extra weight from the vegetables if we divide it evenly by four we all still get on four ounce patties so I will I am spilling everything pretty that's a pretty little mix right there and well I know good well I didn't I have three ounces of vegetables but there's a 16 ounce pack of um hamburger so I've got nineteen point six ounces let me ask Alexa okay Alexa saying four point nine is the weight divided by four so I'm on turn my pan back on I'm just going to use the same old panel if you can see it on camera I can't see back there use the same pan ain't no sense to mess up another one so four point nine I got this we've used it before it's just from the dollar store the Dollar Tree I like to use it on hamburgers a lot because first of all hips get them wider and more uniform so they cook there so I'm just gonna go ahead and weigh it on here let me squeeze this again a little bit don't don't overdo this because this is that lean meat you overwork it and it's gonna be more stuff and dry but it already is so much four point nine ounces it really just smoothing ball happiness really gonna slow didn't close enough for me finer but what is gonna happen to me pop it in there push it down real good see it just makes a nice flat burger now what I like to do poke a hole in the middle like a doughnut that way you don't overdo the outside waiting for the inside to get done it just helps it along the way so I'm gonna paddy these out and pop them in the pan and then I'll just come back after they get baked fried how about that all right now I got the burgers I think they're probably done so I want to hopefully not too gone out I'm the world's worst one especially when it's really really lean now I'm gonna give you I thought I had part-skim mozzarella but had the factory which once out sauce stable point usual never cheese you want just point it out measure it and point it out this fat-free cheese 1/4 cup is zero points I didn't check anymore because is not to take a quarter of a cup um I don't think let me get my little cord cut just to make sure cuz of it looks like it might taste the other the quarter capacity but we're going to use it I'm thinking more along the lines an eighth of a cup so what I want to do is yeah I think doesn't leave it nice half I'll do like an eighth of a cup one of them Judas knows it all to you that much and now this plastic cheese is fun I live just make a big sweat a big flat piece of cheese on it but it is on there now let me just pop that on a second and see if we can get some heat now I covered it when I tried them because I like to cover my beggars to kind of help steam them along cause y'all know y'all seen me I tend to cook high and I will learn something in a second it just helps me not to burn it as often let's let that sleep we can get it some melty maybe we won't melt it all the way to make it one you know slick surface of cheese in the meantime I'm using the great value turkey pepperoni for pepperonis is zero points this is what for pepper image and I sliced it up because I think I'm starting to burn s as much as I'm gonna do did I just not call it up I sure did I'm just gonna use four to save a point but you can use how many ever and point it out I thought maybe four was plenty for that we can always add more but don't don't start with a point and then wish you had taken it off if a less point or a zero point would have worked if that makes sense so I have just your regular plain old white great value hamburger bun use whatever kind of bun you want this one happens to be three points so I'm gonna get mine with a pizza burger with my cheese see it's starting to soften up I think be fine then we're gonna what a mess my add my little can y'all see hold on yeah that's better I might add my little four slices of pepperoni now this is where it's gonna get messy I'm using so making my own I had this already in the cabinet that's what I'm using it's just a great value Pizza songs one point for a quarter of a cup I thought it would be better if it was heated and since the microwave is right above the stove I didn't want to blast it in your ear so I heat it up one cup of sauce that way there's a quarter cup for each burger and I'm just gonna pour that over you know what I think hate to up will do y'all I bet that'll take it down even if it is a point let's don't put the whole quarter cup on there I think that's a bit that's a bit much let's just put a little top on you cut in half see what it looks like I hope it's done hope it's not overdone we'll see oh this is messy no look at that what do you think I'm getting over there so you can see it I want to take a bite and see that cheese went down in that home it looks like a stuffed burger not completely by accident so it made a nice mess I think it's gonna be delicious if I can take a bite of this right quick without scalding my mouth off hmm well y'all this is definitely a winner there so so pizza taste them is very very good I might add a little bit more salt to the meat when I instead of like maybe to the season maybe I want salt around the meat some and that's the only thing I can see that it needs and in my taste buds that's the only thing I can taste that it might need but just to be a little bit more salt oh this is really good y'all need to make this oh I think they was going like this and Kyle - okay

excited about all those sentiments as I was I always need good sentiments and these were fun the fonts and the way that they shaped them so I'm just going through the kit right there showing you what I got and I'm gonna make kind of a little bit of some odd cards I don't know they're not very traditional for me so we're gonna have some fun I pulled out the black cardstock that came with the kit and one of the flower like stamps I'm using some Versamark ink and I am going to pretty much make my own background pattern paper trying to stay within the kit as much as I can and the sentiments are really a focal point here with the dyes that came with it and the stamps so I'm really trying to see what I can do with those I'm pouring over this wonderful silvery glossy and bought silvery is silvery a word sylvie silver anyway it's silver and it's great and I important that all over it's really super shiny and I think that was really surprising to me at how pretty that came out so got that done and then I decided to take some oxides and see what that looked like over some black cardstock so I started off with the twisted citron Justin citron did not come out as much I thought it would because it was lighter but I blend it out the twisted citron the peacock feathers and then I brought in faded jeans and once I got those three colors blend together I actually really like the way that looked so it wasn't obviously it's not bright like it's going to be on white but I do love the look that this gave me so that was a nice little surprise um and then here I'm just wiping down some of the flowers so that the shine is still there and getting some of that embossing it's already distress off then I'm gonna take my mister and I'm just gonna spritz some water on it because I want the oxides to react and they do and so that was nice interests to the card so there is my finished panel okay so the next thing that I am going to do is take a little dauber and some white ink I wanted to see how good this ink stamped out you'll see in the next card it actually stamps out pretty darn good so but right now what I'm gonna do is I'm used the hello die and I wanted to make my own glittery card stock so to do that I'm using the embossing powder that came with the kit I'm gonna heat set that all over this panel and that's gonna give me this wonderful glitter matching because it's gonna match perfectly card stock and then I'm going to take my hello die and I am going to cut that out alright so I do cut out a couple other of the set the dies that came with the kit too just because I had it there using some multi-purpose spray adhesive off-camera and into a box I'm gonna spray the silver hello and then I'm going to add it to a black hello that I cut out and that is going to give a tiny bit of a border so that it stands out against the background I'm also going to use this piece of vellum I pulled out a scallop punch and I'm placing that underneath the hollow dies and then of course I got to hit something having on top of it so hold it down alright so I'm just getting everything in place here for this card and then as you can see I'm gonna map that on a self-made background with more of that heat embossing look so that everything ties together I have a silver map with the black matte and then the card panel so I'm really trying to pull this all together final touches are the black enamel dots that I add here and they're all over the card and that's the first card actually although the scalloped and there's flowers on there I really think I could pull this off as a masculine card the colors are masculine the font like just things it just works so tell me what you think about that one because I think after all was said and done I made three masculine cards which can I tell you totally needed for this - all right so second card here I'm using the craft cardstock that came with the kit and I am stamping out with the white ink that came with the kit and I absolutely love it I think it's fantastic but I didn't love it enough to keep it like that or maybe I was impatient because it was probably gonna stay wet for a while so I decided to heat emboss it with some white embossing powder so I pulled out some Wow superfine white embossing powder and I am just going to set that so that we have a really stark white look okay so I did struggle with these coffee cups love the coffee cups but as you can see up on the card there I put them on crooked so I am going to ink them up with some delicata gold ink and then I am going to stamp them onto a brown piece of cardstock and put that on the bottom so the stamp set there the card says you're amazing you are amazing and then little coffee cups underneath and here I'm adding the stars from the kit just to make this a little bit more fun again very masculine card and I'm adding that on a brown cardstock mat which mat matches the coffee cup cardstock and using some tombow mono adhesive I'm gonna place that down on my Neenah 110 pound solar white card base and on the inside I made my own sentiment so the front said you are amazing and the inside said and I'm not just talking to my coffee so I know I'm super corny but I did that on the inside I do not have the best handwriting so please don't judge me on that one so there is the second card here in the kit and I love coffee cards anything I'm planning on using this little coffee cup just because I love coffee cards so there we have it alright some stills of this one so for the third and final card for this video I am taking out the confetti or streamers whatever you call that from the kit and I am pulling out some distress oxide inks and I am going to just stamp away all over the background of this Neenah 80 pound cardstock I'm just gonna fill that chock full of confetti so once I get that filled up I am going to then add I love the black look on colorful backgrounds like this I think it just pops really well so I took the star back out and I'm adding the star to this background but I am going to cut this background in half using a lawn fawn hillside border so that I can have two cards so there we go I have them separated out and I am going to figure out where I want to place my sentiments and the that's gonna use sorry it's gonna be on black cardstock the stuff that came with the kit I am gonna use some more of that silver embossing powder love that stuff I already said that I know I'm repeating myself and I am going to of course heat set that so this one says yeah it's your big birthday it's her big birthday I don't know I put it together it works for me I felt like the Front's were missing something so I pulled out the little bowtie and I used silver ink and I added the bow ties to the front of that panel as well so I'm gonna put those together I'm going to again tombow mono on the 110 pound card base and then I'm gonna add some of the sequins that came with the kit the stars the sequins the mini stars great mix of sequins that came with this kit and I am just going to add that to the black side of the card and so I got two cards out of that and that will do it for the cards for this video I hope you liked it I hope you enjoyed this video with some more masculine type cards I think we all could probably use a little bit more of those so hopefully this helped you inspired

that subscribe button if you want to see the videos when they first come out hit that notification bell okay card day out of my bloopers so i'm gonna let this dry um when i decided i've already been painting when i decided to stop working on this i tossed it into my little i have a drawers for papers i put them in the one for cards because it wasn't quite going where i wanted it to so i've got to finish it up so i've just put a little pasta here and we'll let it dry and then we'll go back over with a little bit of black or maybe a blue to match this and see where it takes me then the rest of them are done so i'm just finishing this one up all right get that a little dry let me see we'll use some of that i'm just going through and kind of messing this up a little bit so and you know what i want to do you know i want to do this i am going to hit this with it there's no other punch to the whole thing except for this and i'm just going to add a little bit and i don't even want it to be a smooth thing i'm just going to do like this in a few places i mean i'm i cover most of it but i just i want something to just it's bumpy it's all over but it's a bumpy thing let me see if you can see it i don't know if you can you see yeah right there so that's what i've done that's going to add a little fun to it i'll tell you what we're just going to let that dry and we'll come back so that one's done the rest of mine are pretty done so let me show you what i'm working with so all these that i'm going to do so i'm beyond one pattern is the number 10 envelope and that's not the envelope that's my card number 10 envelope so there's the number 10 envelope this is my card that i will cut to fit something like that and this matches this right here it's a little bit bigger a quarter of an inch a little bit there because this is my window that i'm going to look at my paintings to see where i want to cut the card out at so there is this you may recognize it from its little video and so if i did a card like that you know i could do something on that order i could do this i could just do this and leave that have that as the card which short of doing that yeah i would probably do something like that so that's going to be my card so on that let me mark it or do i want to do this no i like that i know i could get two cards out of this but the fact that it there's nothing here um makes it look odd on the other hand that's some pretty stuff so you know what i am i'm just going to do cool cards out of it we'll just do that okay so the measurements of this is i believe not that no let me get your measurements okay nine and about three and a half to three and a quarter so that's what this is so we're gonna go in here we're gonna mark it so i'm gonna do something like that and if i did that actually i could come over this is where this little window helps so much so we'll do something like that foreign okay there it is and what we're going to do i love my big cutter is cut our cardstock and this is it for cutting it so a nine inch and then an eight inch so we'll put that here and what i do is i cut inside these lines now i cut two all i do is take that one put it up against that and i do have a card thing but this is so much easier where you take it and score it anyway there is my card so that i do that on all of them and see that is going to be smaller than my envelope now on the envelope this is what i ended up getting 500 they're cheaper that way but it's amazon basics i've got a link to that down below check that out but i'm thinking why not buy a bunch if you're going to spend the money go ahead and go ahead and get them all right gotta cut my card [Music] nothing to put on now here's another thing i did not draw all these lines straight with my paper now i'm seeing that i'm off a little bit so there's one and i'm gonna do that to cut this line off and we'll do a little bit over here all right there are our two cards now i'm going to show you on one of these how to put it together after that i will just show the cards and how we pick them out now i think i want that more even all the way around i've got it's taller here so i'm going to cut some of that off it's gonna look even perfect and there it is now what i have is double-sided tape and i just go and put it all along the back see anybody else how they're cold this year i'm so aggravated i don't like colds make me talk funny okay here is that i kind of wanted to do this all right and there is a card okay so same procedure on procedure on everything else and this is how it kind of looks this is an obvious we just cut out the whole thing unless no it has to be that so that will be that one now here this is something i am getting excited about i've been waiting to do this one remember that picture i did three or four of them i wanted to play with different ways to do it so how cool is that going to be so i think that's pretty awesome so what i'm going to do because that's about the height i want i will mark this edge because remember whoops something on that order my cutter i've got to be square with this so we'll go ahead and cut that off kind of use this as my guide and you'll figure out your little system what you want to do and i want to make sure i get most to the edge let's just do this in half so if that is eight and a half i need to do [Music] four and a quarter and then i need to do some more i need to do three almost three and a quarter there we go that's one that's the other one see how cool and all these are from your bloopers but see how neat they look now this one i never did do a video on i may because it's pretty interesting i've kept it i wasn't sure what i wanted to do with it so what i need to do is get this down to an eight and this top is down to a nine so i have to cut quite a bit off of it because remember i need an eight by nine nope that's the card this has to be a little bit smaller so i'm going to cut off i don't want to cut off the balloon there's that now this one has to be a little bit less than a nine which is perfect look at that i just cut a little bit of that off and this one is right at an eight so it does need to be an inkling shorter yeah we're going to get a little bit smaller so i'm going to cut here i don't always have this down to an exact science because i keep playing okay so this needs to be about three and three fourths and there's a card this one i think i'm gonna cut this side needs to be three and three fourths very little butt and there's your card now let's do this guy so let me get some measurements so i'm going to do this which means this spot in this spot i don't think that showed up hold on hold on okay there we go okay now from here we start measuring the three and three-fourths measure the little bit less than nine um i'm gonna cut some of this top off though now a little bit less than nine and that's gonna be our card let's see it fits on pretty good and that's it all right so that's some of my bloopers that i have changed and made cards out of and they make really cute cards just got to get your measurements down figure out what you like and there you go so here are all the ones we very quickly did that one took more because i did fun with stuff with it and then there we go there's our little cards so i've got two of those and there's that and that so very quickly we made four five six seven eight cards so how cool is that all right y'all go have fun you", "o_RGzWnILag": "hi everybody I'm Kevin with Kendall science we get a lot of questions regarding candle making math calculating your fragrance oils determining how much wax you need for a project and so on if you find this to be a little bit difficult to wrap your head around you're not alone so let's go through this step-by-step the first thing you're gonna need to do is determine how many candles you want to make of each fragrance so let's say we want to make six straight sided tumblers using our cactus flower in Jade the next step is to determine how much each of those containers holds and for that you can reference our website now keep in mind you should always weigh your materials on a scale as opposed to measuring by volume or in fluid ounces we will list the wax weighed for each container that we carry on the product page now that we know that each of these containers hold 8.5 ounces of wax by weight we can multiply that by the number of candles we're making in order to determine how much wax we need total so for this example 8.5 ounces times 6 is 51 ounces of wax so the next step is to determine how much fragrance oil you're gonna need and that does get a little bit more complicated we recommend starting at a 6% fragrance load which is roughly 1 ounce of fragrance for every pound of wax but you can go higher depending on how much your wax can hold and you will always find this information listed on the product page for your wax once you decide on your fragrance oil percentage you can use that number to determine the overall amount of fragrance oil you're going to need for your project and no matter what the batch size this formula is always going to be the same you take your percentage of fragrance oil multiply that by your amount of wax and it's going to give you the amount of oil you need for your project now this is where the math gets a little bit intimidating so don't be afraid to pull out your phone or use a calculator to help you with some of this precise math you may find it easier to convert that percentage into a decimal first and to do that you just divide it by 100 so 6% turns into point zero 6 if you're using 7% would be point zero seven eight percent so point zero eight and so on and so forth but again for this example we're gonna stick with six percent so if you take that point zero six and multiply it by the 51 ounces of wax that we need you're gonna get 3.06 ounces of fragrance and that's the amount you need for your project now mini scales will not be that precise with their calculations so it's okay to round up or down slightly but you're aiming for that three point zero six so now we know we need 51 ounces of wax for this project we need three point zero six ounces of fragrance and that's what we're gonna use to pour these six straight sided tumblers well thanks for watching everybody I

of new videos hit that notification bell and give me a thumbs up and comments and questions are welcomed i do answer all right so i thought he was coming over here the henry he's stalking me he's laid around three different places looking at me um okay i'm just gonna do bubbles i just want to do some bubbles so i've i've done the pinata inks i've done the sun bright yellow senorita magenta baja blue and passion purple i'm hoping those will be pretty i'm thinking if i hit the yellow and blue together i'll get maybe a greenish tint without putting a green tent because the only other green i have in pinata is rainforest and it's pretty dark so i'm not gonna use that so i'm hoping to stick maybe these two together and let there be something fun there who knows we'll go from there okay i'm going to put a little bit of ink down uh sorry i'll call down and put my inks and just kind of make a background here i'm going to try not to get over in the edges but if i do it's not the end of the world but i'm going to try not to [Music] well i am going to rethink this first that still is pink it kind of i thought at first it looked a lot like purple and i'm like looking pink as it's changing okay nevermind never mind um i'm gonna do some yellow here so so so [Music] [Music] i didn't want that as dark as it was going because i'm getting away from my yellow and i'm blowing it with the revlon um brush blower has brushes that go on the end of course we take those off uh three settings it's got cool low and high that's a temperature and the cool and high blow on high volume the low blows on low volume is that right that's never right the low and high are hot this the volume is low and high i'm going to quit talking about that i've gotten it wrong i think every time i've done this i have it in my head it just doesn't come out right okay i'm going to do i'm going to do blueish here drop things today so [Music] [Music] [Laughter] so oh good break i like them i don't like them so all right since i came so close to the edges here i kind of feel like i need to help that over this way so i'm just gonna do some in the yellow [Music] [Laughter] so so you know what none of you don't worry about it because bubbles are going on top of it but that wears me out so um yeah this is the craziest color i think i've used and it was one of the first ones i used so you can imagine how bad i thought it was because i was like that's not even doing well um okay overall i'm pretty good my i got my green i got the green that goes with these all these are kind of the same what is that hue or something um yeah i like it all right so my thinking what i want to do is wings no no rings i want to do just a shot glass yeah i must use this is one of my bigger ones so i'm gonna use this this is all i'm gonna do um i don't know i kind of want to go in this way this this uh yeah this way okay going to start and just kind of make um not zigzaggy as to but something on this order down to here so i'm going to put one right there okay how i'm going to do this there are a couple ways to do this you can either dip this at alcon put it down lift it back up and the center stays like it is you can put this down and squirt it around here and redesign the alcohol around it and hopefully leave the inside intact what i like to do is put some down put this on top of it and when i lift it up the inside's different so it's going to look distorted a little bit hi rascal and that's what this time i'll do these i wish i had some darker i'm gonna make this a little darker hold on the light i don't think is going to show greatly so [Laughter] okay those are just one of the last minute calls someone do that all right we'll squirt a good bit here put that over it hopefully that's going to spread a little bit i was trying to tilt my glass my table's leaning and i forgot to fix it last time so i'm going to do a little bit underneath and so that's splatted but you know what who cares i'm going to make that work for me i'm gonna go around the glass now there's alcohol running around it i don't see [Laughter] [Laughter] okay let's dry it on the outside i'm gonna lift this up and kind of get it drying in here i like it where it looks odd like that i don't want it to mix so i'm not trying to blow it around just trying to get it dry and i'm not going to worry about this because that'll just add to it so there is a bubble i am going to clean my rim off so that i'm not getting pink in another color okay so if i did here i definitely want to do there with all three colors here you know something like that so we'll do this oh my is there something help you with um yeah sorry i have a visitor so if i did one here i should have brought more glasses over and kind of put it that's what i'm gonna do let me get some more okay this will give us an idea of what we're going to do rascal what are you doing okay we're gonna get this will give us an idea on what we want to do so i know i want one there so if i did that that's not good so i'm gonna put that over there and cover that and maybe one there that looks pretty good yeah all right i like that okay i'm gonna leave these so i don't lose my pattern but i'm gonna take this one up because it's right beside it yeah i need to move these okay i have an idea i remember all right i'm gonna do this one for now we'll stick with this right there all right there's that i'm gonna let it get to those edges [Applause] so far i don't have any it's interesting oh my [Applause] i don't know what are the odds of getting two cats that are crazy of course they're brothers so yeah i guess so still the whole litter was a bit nuts [Applause] [Laughter] he jumped you didn't see it all right i'll do this one here [Applause] so you you [Applause] uh so so oh how have y'all liked me not talking i hope you don't tell me the truth but all right okay now we've got some fun stuff to do this i want to clear up a little bit so i do want to put some alcohol around it and put it down to make more white on at least this one let dry just for a second that'll kind of open that one up a little okay all right what i'm going to do is do a little fun embellishment type stuff i'm going to put some dots um from clear alcohol on there and i keep these lids for just that you know just put it in there you don't have to have a big pallet thing um to break up some of this like i'm gonna do let's see do i want i guess going around the bubbles would be cute some of these are still pink so i kind of want them whitish so i'm gonna hit them again and that'll just push them out that much more okay we'll do some white i'm trying to find a scrap there we go i'm gonna do white around this i'm not gonna do black i don't think but i'm gonna do the white i might do some of the other colors to match but i don't think i'm going to do a black i think i want to keep this more not that it's pastel but just keep it lighter now the only thing i didn't do i did all them with this one except that i used this other one but if i put this around there you'll never know so i'm going to use this size because i don't want to be just one off and brighten them up just a little bit now something i do want to do while i'm thinking about it is i want to go ahead and put some markings i'm not going to put them straight down we'll tube them to the side so there's going to be one on this side one on this side on all of them i see that see how that's that's even circled that's not i need to make sure that stays in proportion and you know an easier way to do this take this dip it in your white but only halfway and just mark it yeah that's your easiest there you go i'll turn it around to the back side and just do a little bit there there you go that's the easiest way to do it let's see here's a purple let's see if it matches and think what i want to do with it well i don't know what i want to do with it i'm going to put this right beside this and see what kind of effect i can get see if it will spread out it may been too dry if they get too dry they'll they'll act a lot like the inks they won't have the spreading properties to them but it's not moving much um okay i need something i can wipe clean or i just another card that's fun okay so what i want to try to do is hmm not great but interesting i might could do clear to kind of neaten it up and these ran together so that helped so yeah put another dot on with clear that worked out great yeah i think i want to use the baja blue i'm really loving the fact that a lot of these bombay inks match so that's that has been good you you and you know take all this with a grain of salt pick pick what you like take it with you and leave the rest and i'm just kind of pulling some of these colors a little bit you don't need to pour out a whole lot of this save it and i'm putting the dark kind of one side to really make a darker area mess that up a little bit i may go back over with the white because the white is not white white and i kind of want it white this needs wider oh yeah yes yeah i do like them a little wider oh do you see what i did i got red in there all right put it over here not in the red yeah i think i want the bubble looking stripe a little more definite i am gonna take a pasta to that and i know this will turn i just don't think i want to start white or i could spray it and then they would be fine but see these aren't going to be stark white so i think it's all right and the tv all right you know i know it's a little bitty and there's not a lot it's not my typical bunch of stuff but i'm liking it i do want this one outlined more i think it needs some of this magenta more all the way around it because it's not standing out like i want it to that should do it that's pretty strong okay yep i'm happy with that all right i'm gonna stop so y'all go have fun thanks for watching you", "h6-_WGelNsM": "[Applause] oh [ __ ] Oh here we have the aftermath of the the ten Bohr shotgun using Federals two and a quarter ounce twelve twenty feet per second probably approximately about a hundred pellets of lead BB coated in copper I she was a wallop her to shoot and bb's penetrated anywhere from a minimum of two and a half inches to most of them penetrating to about ten to twelve and just a handful getting past about thirteen this is the ballistics gel test of the Federal Premium uh plan load we got our ten bore three-and-a-half inch Magnum two and a quarter ounce load of copper plated let B be recovered bb's late weighed in at eight point four grains as expected velocity is advertised at one thousand two hundred and twenty feet per second I did not want to risk my chronograph testing weapon used was a full choke Spanish aya mercury Magnum we had a large amount of trauma initially as expected when the one initially hit most pellets seemed to fall into a range between 8 and 13 inches penetration of the bb's was expected at a range of four yards and the velocity all considered penetration was within expected parameters and there is a great deal of trauma along the track the mercury Magnum is a full choke but an undersized bore the bore is seven five five inches of seven seven five inch and the bore is seven to five the choke is seven to five still making it a full choke recoil was manageable but still a doozy here's from the top of the block showing the paths of the bb's through the block and the general mass trauma at the front from the front of the block we can see quite a bit trauma it where most of the pellets hit and created quite a large gash along with quite a bit of damage surrounding it the initial damage was quite severe you", "F0C3TAo4Ptc": "all right guys we're gonna start a project and this is going to be more of like a get-together and create an album together um each week until it's finished now I'm using Kathy orders original hidden hinge binding system and I have put a link to her original video from seven years ago and I know she has an updated versions that version that is patent protected so I wanted to make sure Kathy got credit because I am sharing her original idea now I know that you can contact Kathy and get the the newer instructions directly from her okay so we're gonna do her original hidden hinge and make an envelope journal so I asked that you get a 6x6 pad if your envelopes you know if you you're wanting to decorate these the reason I said 6x6 is because I have a ton of 6x6 paper pads that I need to use up and I'm not buying any more paper until I've used some up so 6x6 or if you've got 8x8 and you have larger envelopes use your 8x8 if you've got really big envelopes you can use them but you could might need 12 by 12 paper so whatever paper pad you have that you would like to get used up you need a paper pad we're not going to use this tool probably next week because we're gonna do the binding today the decorating will come later but the idea is to use up a 6x6 paper pad or a good bit of it then you need six envelopes and I'm using invitation envelopes that are oh let's see that's four and three-eighths by 5 and 3/4 okay so that's what I'm using you can use any size envelopes to do this you can use toilet paper rolls to do this you can use anything that you can make a page out of you can use this hinge system with and then unique cardstock and I am using um I am using 110 pound cardstock I bought this at Walmart a while back so I've got that and you need that to create the hinge um if you only have lighter weight cardstock it will work it just will not have the longevity if your gonna give it to somebody that's gonna constantly flip through it or you know it takes it and shares it like a brag book where it's gonna get the pages turned a lot if it's a lighter weight cardstock it will have a tendency of breaking down quicker okay so basically today you need one sheet of cardstock and your six envelopes save any off cuts for tags and such for later okay so I'm gonna set the paper the extra paper and the paper pad aside alright alright did you find the link hi Vicki I'm only staying on for an hour today an hour each Thursday that's Kathy orders original video right there I just put it up and it's also in the description box below alright the first thing you need to do is because everybody's probably gonna have different sized envelope I want you to open your envelope and you can see let's see you see how your envelope comes up at an angle here we want to know the distance from where that envelope starts going up on that side and where it is on this side and mine came out to be 5 and 5/8 so we want to cut a 5 and 5/8 inch strip from our card stock in height five and five eighths so I'm going to cut that all right then to do six pages you're gonna need a piece that's nine and three-quarter inches long and remember save the offcuts you can use them later and I'm going to put all of my stuff for this weekly project in a gallon sized ziploc bag so that I can keep track of it all right so cut this at nine into quarters all right set that aside all right so if you've got the same size envelopes as me let's do got Teresa Church and Nancy and Rhea and Vicky Biggs and there's Mary and Samantha Owens and Vicky Ross and Don boss and Samantha Owens all right so get your measurement of what your flap is from where so that the hinge will insert inside the envelopes so that's why I say measure just a little bit inside this edge of this you see if I can find a different piece of paper here so you guys can maybe see this this is how I got my five in 5/8 where that flap comes up you start it just inside the envelope a little bit and then measure over to the same part on the other side and that's how I came up with five and five eighths so if you measure the width of your envelope mine's at five and three quarters you you're basically taking an eighth of an inch off the width of your envelope that might make more sense to y'all hi gloria so measure your with your envelope and then take an eighth of an inch away cut a strip that wide and then by 9 and 3/4 all right I'm gonna try if you guys need me to slow down so you can catch up just say it and we'll slow down and I'll chat and that kind of stuff I want this to be something where you guys can answer ask questions and get answers while we're doing it and I know that some people might get frustrated with me over that but the whole idea is to show you guys how to do one of these albums really quick all right once you get your piece the width of your envelope and nine and three-quarter inches long everybody will need the nine and three-quarter inches long okay hi Cheri huh bings then we're going to need our scoreboard um if you don't have a scoreboard this part I mean you can still do it but you you might have to do pencil lines and you know and then use your ruler and all that what is the large white sheet it's um the 110 pound cardstock from Walmart and like I said earlier if you don't have a hundred and ten eighty will work but if it's going if you're gonna gift this to somebody that's going to share it a lot and it's going to get a lot of opening and closing and people looking through the pages you might want to make sure you have a hundred and ten pound cardstock you don't want to go much thicker than that because then it won't it won't whatever this is emboss very well and it might crack this is to make the hinge marry we're going to make a hinge to put our envelopes on okay and this is Kathy orders original hidden hinge guide all right so once you get your sheet to 5 and 5/8 wide by 9 and 3/4 the first mark you're going to mark at one and a quarter all right so mark one and a quarter then you're going to do 1/2 inch so come over from one and a quarter to one in 3/4 so you'll do another half an inch so one two at two and a half is that right no that's too much two and a quarter but that's ok because the next mark is a quarter so you'll do one in one quarter then you'll mark another half an inch so from one and a quarter you'll go to one in three quarters and then from one in three quarters you'll go to two and a quarter and then the next mark you'll do is two and a half so you'll have two sections that are at 1/2 1/2 1/4 then we're gonna do 1/2 1/2 1/4 and you'll just completely keep doing that all the way across now if you guys need me to write down exactly where each of the marks are I can do that really quick after I get them marked okay it's 9 and 3/4 inches the long way and then whatever your measurement for your envelope is from an eighth of an inch smaller than the width of your envelope so you've got to measure whatever your envelopes are mine happen to be 5 and 3/4 so when I take an eighth of the way that's five and five eighths alright so I'm going to keep doing that and then when I'm done I'll write down what these measurements are for you if that would help Oh Lord I'm so sick of those warnings Oh Scott sent me a message to he said there's six hand turkeys I bet he had to go a different way to get the word six hand turkeys by the school water up to the bridge at the creek by the pretty cows oh boy that's a lot of water all right so one you do one and a quarter and then do you two marks a half an inch away from each other and then another quarter inch let me finish these and I'll give you the exact measurements so now we need to go a half inch at three and a half inch at three and a half and then we'll do a corridor so we're at three and three quarters now we've got to do a half an inch so that's four and a quarter another half an ounce just four and three quarters and then we need to do quarter so that's five okay and then five and a half and six and six and a quarter six and a quarter and then six and three quarters I'll write these down and put them in the description box six and three quarters and then a half an inch from that seven and a quarter and then seven and a half and then eight and eight and a half and then that you should have an inch and up by an inch and a quarter left on the end here alright so let me write these measurements down for you guys hi journey alright so your score marks score at one in one quarter one and three quarters two and a quarter two and a half two and a half three three and a half three and three quarters three and three quarters and four and a quarter four and three quarters for three quarters five five and a half six six and a quarter six and a quarter six and three quarters seven and a quarter seven and a half yeah then eight and eight and a half all right so that's this course it's gonna be hard to read all right so that was the score lines for anybody that's watching this as a replay the measurements will be in the description box as soon as I sign off from here all right so this is basically you suck it all right now we're gonna fold on these so fold the first one and a quarter inches fold it up like this go ahead and score it this will attach to the front of your book okay so the next one you're gonna make a mountain with it and then we're gonna fold it back the other way this way on the next you I'm the very next line it gets a little fiddly when you're getting down to the quarter inch score lines but you're gonna score on all of your score lines first okay but what you'll end up with is you'll have we're gonna put some glue back here on the half inch measurements and bring them together so that'll give you a place to glue your envelope this is just like we did on the paper bag album they last year was it or the year before year before the next one we're going to fold it's hard to describe this until I get to the second half inch so make a mountain we at your half inch centers because you're gonna do this will go on the cover so like if your book is open here's your cover so you'll have um there'll be an envelope here then they'll be a quarter-inch space I I did just like she did because you know how we fill these up with tags and stuff like that then this will be another hinge here and you're just gonna keep folding it so that it does this see how it makes that but I want to get them all all folded before I glue anything and you can use any color paper to make your hinge really I thought about using black paper but I didn't changed my mind and use why I actually have a multi packet of that that's got gray and black and brown I think so just keep folding on your score lines basically the quarter inch one the quarter inch scores they're a little bit more fiddly because they're so narrow but you really do want that space but see when you fold on it they both are going the same way so you're creating a flat valley like that so what if you're looking at it from the hinge side this will go up there goes my sump pump again like this alright you can see how the quarter-inch wants lay flat and you get like these ribs that this is where you'll attach your and so we'll just keep going you fold this back up and then you go back down on your half inch so that you've created another mountain on the half inch one I just find it easier to fold these um quarter inch ones if I kind of flip the paper back and forth so that it lays flat I had made one of these up but I figured you know if we are working along I would just make another all right now we're gonna do another mountain on the half inch piece and I look at chat here in just a second to see if there's any questions before I go on to the next step you just want to make sure that the the quarter inch ones make up when you get it between two mountains the half inch ones make mountains and a quarter inch ones make the valley in between so you want to make sure that that you don't want to fold the second one the opposite way you want to make sure that the half inch score lines are pointing in the second same way so they point up to create the mountain so it's a wide valley in between your half inch mountains alright and I've got one more mountain here score that and then we just need this last one to go back up this way all right see you end up please make all these valleys and if you if you count your mountains you should have six one two three four five six okay alright is everybody doing okay I don't know who all is um yeah I'm gonna put the measurements for the score lines and I'll remind you all you need an with six pages you need nine and three-quarter inches and then the width of your envelope less an eighth of an inch because you could you want your hinges to fit inside the envelopes everybody dude oh hey peg let's see Britney Hollow yes we're making an envelope journal alright so I'm not seeing any questions it's a rainy day we're trying to fill up time what you're gonna do once you get all your little mountains here you've got to glue them together some way now you can use glue or tape whichever you want I've actually got scotch quick dry inside my baby bot here so I'm just gonna put some Scotch quick-dry in here you can use red line tape or double-sided tape just don't get the glue on the quarter inch spots just the half-inch spots my stomachs growling at you guys all right and then just pinch your mountains together fiddly fiddly if you wanted to glue them one at a time you can I'm just pinching my two pieces together that's on the half inch side to create my ribs or my hinges all right so you'll end up with something like this it might take a minute for the glue to settle up so there we go all right I'm just trying to make sure they're um glued together well all right so this is your ribs that you'll attach your own thing that's okay dawn if you go back and just do the replay then you can stop me and work and then rewind and that kind of stuff that's fine hi Anne so is anybody having trouble with their hinge you should have something like this after you glue it together it'll look like that on the back and it'll have thins like that okay we're gonna set this aside and let the glue dry and now we're gonna get our envelopes and I want you to you're gonna think this is crazy but I want you to go through and glue all your envelopes closed and I would just lick this and stick this but these are like ancient old envelopes so I'm just gonna put a little of my Scotch quick-dry along the edge and just close them up that way and just close them up just don't get too much glue on or you'll glue it completely closed and we do need to get we need to be able to get back inside it in a minute and I did mean for this to be kind of a work along so that's why I'm focusing on just doing the project trying not to do a lot of chitchat in case somebody else you know doesn't want to hear all the chitchat I want Thursday to be more of a kind of a tutorial kind of day just glue all your envelopes closed there is another way to do this to use the flaps and all but I wanted to the first one we do together to be a little bit you know just really easy to do okay so they're all closed all glued close so what you're gonna do now is you're gonna take your cutter and you're gonna just cut just a little sliver off that both edges you're going to cut a little sliver off here and a little sliver off on the other side just make sure all of your envelopes end up to be the same width so whatever measurement you trim to on the very first envelope all of them need to be that same size okay hold up Janet we're making pockets don't worry about that we're good it's all good so I'm gonna trim just a tiny you just need to trim off enough to open it back up this way by doing it this way you don't have a flap if you um to get in the way you can get into the pocket and then you have a flat page surface to a full flat page so just trim off a tiny little bit oh my my blade came off hang on what what I'm gonna trim mine down to let's see I think I'll trim mine so they all are at four and a quarter I think that'll do let's see if that'll be good I think I'm open so after you trim you should have something like this okay Janet says she's just thinking out loud jeez back we're having pockets it's all good so I'm trimming mine to be four and a quarter inches um this way not the width the other way unless that's the way you wanted to do your pockets I just wanted more upright surface to um put pictures and things on okay four two four four and a quarter and I'm not keeping the little trim II bits off the envelopes I was noticing the Italian restaurant up the road has got um they're gonna have prime rib special for Valentine's thought that was interesting saw that today when I ran to the post office I waited for the rain to stop enough to go to the post office and drop the postcards in that I made the last night because it wasn't sure if the mail lady's gonna get here without the envelopes and you know postcards getting wet out there in the mailbox so it's just been a horrible day here today does that go all the way through yeah it's got a little glue on it that's why it's hanging up that's why you have to be careful up how much glue you put on so you don't glue your envelope close alright alright so you should end up with all your envelopes looking but like here alright so now you have a way to get into the side all right how's everybody doing are we doing okay alright so we're gonna bring our hinges back over here yeah they're gonna you can still put stuff in them it's just it'll be a nice neat square page then you won't have that flap in the way if you're um you still not glued down good enough or if it's coming up you can always add a little glue like I said these envelopes were down in the garage here so they're probably 30 or 40 years old the bottom of the envelope wasn't glued all the way so I need to go back and get those corners glued down it probably won't matter in the long run but it's bothering me so I'm gonna glue them down that'll give everybody a chance to catch up with me this is just where the bottom was not quite glued tube at the factory I think they probably didn't worry about it I figured it's closed finally got me a copy of my favorite magazines at a different grocery store I was so glad to finally find it all right I just want to make sure that my envelopes aren't gonna fall apart all right so I've got my envelopes so I can put a tag in the side and I can attach it to my hinge before I do that though what I want to do these have set up now is I'm gonna cut a little bit of an angle off from each hinge so that it'll sit nice inside these envelopes inside the envelopes okay so I'm just gonna trim and these do not have to be even they're going to be hidden inside the envelope anyway and I'll show you what this looks like when I get them all cut alright so all of my mountains now have an angle cut on a planet so fuzzy you'll see how that is maybe see how can we show you there you go there you can see that I've got an angle cut on each one of these see how the mountains have mountains on this edges alright now what we're gonna do is I'm gonna put some glue on both sides of my mountain I'll take an envelope and get the edge open again don't matter which way you put it on there and I'm just gonna slide the envelope over the mountain the only thing you want to make sure is your pages all line up as you put them on so take your time the only reason I can go quick at this as I've made several of these but I am trying to make myself slow down you can use tape too I just find that this quick dry glue works really good trying to get that to stick up there so it'll be out of my way here we go and you can spread your glue out with your finger too that might be a good idea and try not to get it in your valleys like I just did there okay now I need a wet one or something to put the glue all right take my hand below this actually slides on better if you got it down flat like this and because I am using quick dry all right just kind of make sure you're even and then pinch it along there you just don't want to push your envelope down so far down in that it's taking up space on either your valley or your um your cover flap what is my favorite magazine quilts and more and the reason I like quilts and more is because they have more than just quilt projects this one had a baby quilt and in a tote bag and pillows and all kinds of projects in it and it's only available on the newsstands at least that's what they told me but then I saw this company called xeno and they were advertising that I could get a subscription to it so I might order a subscription to it for the longest time it was available by newsstand only let's take your time oh man come on I will get it on there it's so dark and dreary today make sure you bring your envelope up so that you make sure your second page that you put on the same position is the first one you put on before you squeeze it down into the glue and if you have any glue running amuck this is when you when you clean it up real quick oh and another reason to not use tape is if you put tags in sometimes that tape will grab your tags you know and glue once it's dried it's dried and you can use tacky glue if that's what you have I just really like scotch quick dry I don't know why I just do all right we will need some chipboard too let's see what time is it now it's 3:40 I just want to make sure everybody is at the same point when we stop for today and then next week will you'll need the chipboard we might wait and do that next week since I didn't call for it today and that'll give you guys a chance if you want to use like left oh um if you want to recycle a piece of chipboard that'll give you a week to get it together if you don't have one on hand and I'm just working my way from one side to the other of these now I know Kathy Scott Kathy order has some other hinging options [Music] she has one this is hidden hinge and then she's got another one that lays a lot flatter so you might want to go check out Kathy orta's channel it's Kathy order something else now though she got married but she's she's on live sometime showing her her techniques and stuff they're pretty close I'm just trying to make sure there is even as I can get on put it that way this is just fiddly fiddly bits it's like she said in that video I shared in the description box you can make these any size you can go great big or you can do it e bitty or you can use toilet paper rolls she's done all kinds of stuff I actually found one of her books at the thrift store one time and I was like oh yeah yeah I know Kathy order well I know we're on YouTube but I don't know her in person but anyway I got all excited about it because I love her techniques and the ideas she comes up with amazes me as far as journal creating so I can't talk Kathy up enough and I would encourage you to go check out her channel one more and I'll have all six envelopes and see now this side is open and we can put tags in there now if you're using like the envelopes and card sets you can use the cards and I don't know if I have a card to show you or not I'll fold a piece of paper and show you what I mean hang on just a second I know Mary you had your pictures of some of your projects which you can do and map them and put them on these envelope pages and mat him and put him in the pockets that would be really cool [Music] yes I was gifted the baby bot and it works great for my Scotch quick-dry because I don't like to buy this scotch you can't really get it in a bigger bottle but it's my favorite glue because it it grabs quick and dries quick for what I'm doing you know I was I would say a lesson tutorial whatever and if you're if you um are going somewhere for a class or something I found that the quick dry works if you're having to work along it dries just really quick now if you are one that just needs more time to make sure everything is in position I would recommend tacky glue because it gives you more time to work alright so there we go and what we'll do is we'll create a we'll have a piece of chipboard here and then we'll have two pieces for the covers okay and we'll do that next week but I was going to say if you have the cards that go with your envelopes you see I'll just get one of these pieces of extra and I'm just gonna cut what do you guys say was the height on this five and five eighths I'm gonna do five and a half inch tall just make it like a regular card size and then I'll score it at four and a quarter so it'll be for a quarter by five and a half alright so say you have the sets where you have the envelopes and the cards you know like the ones they sell it go and Michaels and all that go ahead and fold the card this is kind of a finishing thing but I didn't want you to think you know you couldn't use those pre-made cards set things either but then you can take your card let's do it on the one that's already dried a long time you can just slide it in the pocket like that just slide it in the pocket it might have to be trimmed down a little but what it does is now you have a flap but you can still pull the card out and you can use this side on the inside and the outside so like the part that gets slid inside you have a place here in a place there and I think you would have to trim your cards because we got to take into account for the hinge we have in there so maybe yet trim it down so it's four inches wide instead of four and a quarter I'm just going to put it on here this is the fold of the card I'm going to trim the quarter inch off so then you you would have all of these spaces that you could put pictures or decorations or whatever and see that just folds out so if you have the card set you can use them and if you want them to go in farther you can trim even more off this is still sticking out too much for me three and three quarters let's see if transit over in July will do lets see because I'm I've got such a big hinge in there I'm having to trim this down there we go that's gonna that that brings the fold of the card to the edge here so just trim your cards and then you have a little flap that folds out and then you can still pull it out so it's like a flat card tag thing so you could do that for each of your envelopes then you still have room in there to add more stuff but we'll get to the decorating and all of that another time its 347 let's see our Janet thanks for the link to the yeah this is the-- this one is this is the baby bod and this was a gift somebody gifted this to me it's on Amazon but it's also from fast Capcom I don't know who has the better price but this came from Amazon but the original website is fast cap and it does come with two different tips I just like then the smaller tip so I just pitched the other one I didn't even save it isn't that horrible use whatever glue you have alright so is everybody to this point where you have your envelopes and your your hinges are created and your envelopes are on what's the thing with it what do you mean this here this right here is the cover to keep the glue from drying out and you can put it on the lid over here I feel like they should be paying me because I think I've sold a lot of baby bots and you can put it over here just to get it out of your way so you can see what you're doing and then you just take it and put it back on there to cover your glue so it doesn't dry out let's see I have the big guy too this has got regular tacky glue in it once you fill this up and you put this lid on here never open this lid again until you have to refill because you're what you do is you fill it up and then when you open this side and you squeeze the bottle when you squeeze it see how the glue look the glue just comes up and out this other side and you don't have to do that shakedown and then when you let go of it it pulls the glue back down away from the tip and back into this chamber if you open this you displace that air that's being utilized to move the glue around does that make sense but yeah baby by you you guys owe me some money okay so done good um let's see next week I'm just we've got the last ten minutes I'm not going to attempt anything else now if you want to by next week if you have cards and you want to do this number go ahead and get them trimmed to fit I might go and make a bunch of these cards just to put in here I am going to show you how to on the opposite side of where a card would flap over I'm going to show you how to make a pocket as we decorate so on the back sides if you jump ahead don't decorate the back sides of the envelope for a little while until if you don't want to learn how to do the pocket the angle pocket on the back side then don't worry about it but if you want to wait and learn something new I would say wait and just keep working along with me next week as well as your paper pad so you'll next week bring your paper pad again save your bits of trimmed off bits from your making cards or if you have the cards that came with the envelopes you can use those just trim them so they'll fit in your pocket so they are snug in there so like the fold of the card comes to the edge of your envelope do that you're going to bring your paper pad whichever size you decide to use and then you're going to need some chipboard and I will show you how to trim it down but it needs to be each let's see if it's six by if you have a piece that's about six by twelve that would probably give you a big enough not be enough it'll give you enough chipboard to do a spine and a front and a back and we'll attach that on there okay so this is something we're gonna do each Thursday and we'll go a little bit farther each Thursday and I figured this way it would be a project that everybody could work along and if they had questions they could be answered and if you needed more time to get to each stage you'd have all week so I only want to do a little bit of the project each week instead of trying to do a whole bunch of it and then we all end up with this journal that's half finished laying around blah blah blah so watch the replay barb just watch the replay and I will be back here next Thursday at 3:00 for another hour I want to keep these at an hour so nobody gets bored and next week bring a chipboard piece enough big enough to do a cover for your envelopes okay and your paper pad and adhesives alright and I will see you guys next week Thursday at 3 p.m. for this project 3 p.m. on Wednesday for dirty dozen or pick 10 okay thank you guys so much take care", "SMd8YUkEw1k": "[Music] [Music] straight hull design tapered hull design Eurotrash federal American your PIN what's it all mean guys this isn't rocket science if you want to load shells it's easier than you think don't let the media don't let the gum boards and the so-called gurus intimidate you into not loading but you know what we can't really discuss that out here I'm gonna take you guys back to the bunkhouse and we're gonna go over with some diagrams like a Reading Rainbow of reloading come on what you see in front of you is a thora of watts but guess what you really don't need all these wads basically holes come in two basic shapes you've got what's known as your straight wide hole and you can see we took this federal promo and we cut it in half so you can see see the case right in here has all that extra room that's called straight wide and a lot of the Federals are made like that and a lot of the Eurotrash are made like that if not all the next wads aren't known as the taper wads and you can see here why taper hole do you see the difference in the thickness here and that kind of comes down and compresses right in here and this is a gun club compare it to the federal up there yeah you're getting the point now what you need to do is find a wad which fits these holes as close as you can now one thing about these is you can use a wad that belongs here and put it in here and you probably would have no problem but if you use a wand that belongs in a taper hole in a straight hole you're gonna lose a lot of that energy from the powder burning and efficiency so what is there to do oh this is a good chance for you guys take a look as you can see a one-piece Hall you see it's all plastic one piece of plastic extruded with just a base on it see that compared to how they make these is just a cheap shell and they put the look at that's the paper compressed paper so when you guys are talking about shooting your wads out no they're not being dirty they're telling you the truth these come loose and they shoot out creating a bore obstruction but I've yet to experience that and hopefully never will the easiest way to determine which wads fit into what hole right is to grab your hole that you're using and cut the base right off see this alright this is an STS hole this is a double a hole hard to believe but yeah it's doubly hole cut close to the bottom you can see right there alright you see this is the base this is the top cut it right up and you can see inside whoa there's the taper do you see that is the one we did a bunch of firing I think 11 or 12 firings on it's smaller here to fit into here you see that how that fits nice yes right and you'll see taper see how that fits down in there very nice you know gaps for powder and gas to escape from you cut the hole that you're gonna be using right and then you take your wad he's gonna weigh you your wad and you insert it in the hull and you see just how much of a gap if any you'll see around here see that very very nice tight no issues with this whatsoever when you shoot them now if you take and you put this same wad and say a Fiocchi Fiocchi we've been over this already and you put it in do the same test look at the looseness oh man look at the sloppy fit we've got you see that so take the hole as you're loading look at once you just slide right out not good for accuracy no note now check these guys out these are a clone for a straight walk very nice by the way now whoa look at that that's a tight fit do you see that no space so when the gas is act upon this powder cup there's gonna be nowhere for the gases to escape and you'll get full velocity the way was designed let's check out a Eurotrash Eurotrash same thing this is whoa that's beautiful look at that oh if you can call them beautiful put them in there and look now this hull is a federal see that now you see how you've got a little bit of space right there that's not good so that's why the rule is not hard and fast now oh look we've got a figure eight but these figure eights are made for straight wall put this guy in and look at that holy count you've get you got a nice tight fit huh funny innit so best advice I could give you guys is cut a hole in half grab a couple of them look at that nice tight fit now let's try the figure eight clones for the taper hull in a straight straight hole and look at that you can see do you see how much loose space there is right there how jiggles around like that that's not good one more hole okay here's the grand alright and we'll try it with a taper hole design stick this guy in and you can kind of see look at that holy calendar all the slop in that look at that there's too much slop too much slop that isn't good that's not good for accuracy that isn't good for anybody you see that what nope that's like we said before people look at that nice tight fit man it's a thing of beauty so do not be scared there's a ton of holes I know it looks overwhelming but basically for the imports Eurotrash use the federal or the federal clones you see that this is federal this is the federal clone holy cow they almost look identical don't they except this is one in one quarter this is one ounce well you can see the cup on the shot couple it is lower over here but still performance is excellent nice deep gas cup let's see that so straight wad go with this design tapered go with this design this is the double-a design this is a clone for your double-a oh here's where the rules get muddy this one is a clone but it's a clone for the straight ball and actually this was designed specifically with the federal gold medals in mind now this is tall nothing to worry about is the height see how tall that is and look how short that is compared to look how short that is so bulk your powder in here won't do which is why I load these with 800 X bulk your powder in here excellent bulk your powder in here excellent bulk your powder in here figure-eight excellent and you can see why leaves a lot more room see when I tell you simple straightforward it's easy you can do this you know you can do this don't let people tell you you can do it don't be intimidating and not wanting to do it just because you don't think you have the information I just broke it down we just broke it down for you get out there do your shooting questions comments concerns you guys send them on down until next time [Music]", "i34POetFrTw": "hi it's dora that yarny zebra right here in the kitchen yes it's me it is me right here in the kitchen still don't have my apron oh it's coming it's coming that the yarny zebra is going to get an apron but let's just talk about this little object lesson today i'm going to talk about this uh lovely recipe that we most of us absolutely love love love love love love and you know i'm just going to talk about this briefly this is a life lesson um you know how we can get vegetables in a can that we have not planted picked and prepared ourselves and um there just might be something in it that um is not tempting or tasty but it's tempting to just put that big can into your mix without proofing it first or checking it first to make sure you're not going to get any stalks in with your good stuff this is that lovely green bean casserole that we enjoy periodically this time of the year sometimes more often sorry clean my hands but i i am just sharing a little bit today about when we are not careful and we let things come into our home or enter our lives that may not always be what we expect or meet our standards growing up on a farm uh that had a specific way that he prepared to butcher our hogs every season and i'll just tell you back when i was growing up this time of year was very cold and sometimes snowy so um this was this was hog butchering time of year right here guys so that we would have plenty of stuff to put on the table and give thanks but it's raining and it's almost 60 degrees here today in kentucky where i grew up but just sharing a little bit but you have to know whenever you go and pick out a movie to watch with your family you need to make absolutely sure that halfway through it you're not going to find garbage trash um yeah invite somebody in who's going to go against your morals standards movies youtube videos whatever it is and you need to make sure that it is exactly what you need to eat see taste share with your people give to your family come on now what what do they expect from you if you are watching that movie and all of a sudden all this explicit junk comes across the screen language is way out of school way out of control are you going to turn it off are you going to let your kids listen to that oh well i grew up watching tv said somebody that's just the way hollywood is is it garbage in garbage out so if you're watching movies or things with your kids that just not appropriate the language is outrageous the innuendos on a lot of the disney movies that are written by adults not children but are supposed to be for children yeah make sure absolutely sure we're getting ready to put this in here but right now i'm giving you a little bit of food for thought make sure that going back over here the garbage is not in it okay so you can pause it and let the kids watch it anyway wait there's that part that we may not want you to hear okay reminds me of that story not sure if it's true or not but kids wanted to do something the dad was like oh i'm not i'm not too sure about this but uh well dad everybody else is letting their kids go to the movies and um everybody else's kids are going i want to go well you know that's got language in it that's inappropriate just a little bit i mean it's it's not the whole movie can you hear that argument okay so the dad decided he would go ahead and um make some brownies the kids come home from the movie they smell that good stuff and they're just like oh dad did you make brownies yep sure did oh my goodness i'm gonna have some pour's a glass of milk dad's like yep sure did how about them brownies um just let me tell you something before you eat into it i decided to mix a little of the ingredients up a little bit got a little bit of dog poo in it but it's just a little bit it's not going to affect anything i mean come on guys don't put the cup back up you want some brownies you said you wanted brownies you just watched that movie only had a little bit of bad language in it this is just a little bit of poo in this brownies just a little bit i mean the chocolate goodness is going to um no dad i don't want that it's got poop in it really what about that movie just had a little bit oh garbage in garbage out i'm taking out the garbage y'all this garbage is going in the trash yeah hopefully somebody come here and take my garbage out for me there you go all righty then this is going in the oven doesn't have any garbage in it no poop no stalks but it's gonna be good this is just part of it guys um gonna take this out of the oven in about 20 minutes add a little more of the goodness in it absolutely yes these came from save a lot my favorite yes i did do a taste test and they are delicious so this is going to um go in the oven for a little bit and then we're going to add a little more crunchies on top

foods 101 today I'm going to show you how to cook fresh sea bass in 15 minutes this is an 8 ounce wild call Chilean sea bass from Argentina very fresh if you smell your fish with your nose it's not a fresh catch so make sure you use your nose to indicate how fresh your fish is I'm going to use olive oil fresh cracked pepper a little kosher salt and a half of the lemon first we're going to add a little olive oil here to the fillet you just want to make sure you coat your play very well with olive oil oK you've got all the sides you've got the bottom the top this is one beautiful fillet a sea bass y'all now we're going to salt pepper it you're going to use a 12-inch skillet and I'm going to put this over medium-high heat so we can get this skillet really hot we're going to add a little kosher salt just add it to all sides here of your fillet okay just a little bit of flavor and then I've got some fresh cracked pepper I'm going to add to this just like that and you can rub it in so you can get it evenly distributed through the sides and the top and bottom of your fillet now this goes off to that smoking hot skillet sear for five minutes do not touch it move it or turn it let it sear for five minutes use your timer five minutes are up it's time to turn this beauty and I can't wait to see how it looks look what a beautiful sear that is oh yeah that's a gorgeous beautiful sear on there time it for five minutes on this side use your timer second five minutes are up now this goes off to a 450 degree preheated oven for the next five minutes you should try I just took that fillet out of the oven and I'm going to put it right here on a serving dish oh my goodness and I'm immediately going to squeeze that fresh lemon here on the top so it can just absorb down into that sea bass oh goodness yummy does it smell fantastic I've let my filet rest for about three minutes and I'm going to show you how lovely and flaky it is on the inside just look at that absolutely oh my goodness and it smells so heavenly and so fresh mmm got to give it a bite mmm oh my gosh that is one of the best catch of the day absolutely out of this world and liquor mmm so flaky the perfect amount of seasoning doesn't need to be much you really don't want to lose that fabulous see best flavor by overloading it with different seasonings mmm Wow y'all you're absolutely going to love this if you are a sea bass lover this is the recipe for you hey leave me a comment give me thumbs up here on YouTube or Instagram leave me a comment y'all shares video thanks a million for watching and

all children are welcome to tune in this lesson is the ninth in our series my name is Kayla Anderson and I'm an eighth grade math teacher at Rocky Ford middle school in the Rutherford County School System I'm so excited to be your teacher for this lesson welcome to my virtual classroom if you didn't see our previous lesson you can find it on the Tennessee Department of Education website at www.ge.com if you don't already have the student packet for this lesson you can find it online at www.azpbs.org/volunteer [Music] you will need paper pencil and a surface to write on okay let's get started Sam and Shamir are simplifying this expression 6 and 1/2 subtract negative 10 plus 3 and 1/4 Sam says the answer will be negative since the 10 is negative and it is larger than 6 and a half plus 3 and 1/4 Shamir disagrees he says that the answer will be positive and because all the numbers are positive and being added who do you agree with Sam or Shamir well let's take a look at this first Samir says that it's going to be a positive answer because all of those numbers are positive and they're all being added when we look back up here we've got subtraction and a negative 10 so we need to figure out whether Shem here is even correct in his statement about them all being positive and being added remember in previous lessons we've discussed this phrase of adding the opposite and we've discussed that you can leave the first add end the way that it currently is so 6 and 1/2 and then you add the opposite of that second add end so we change subtraction to addition and we're going to be adding the opposite of this second add end well the opposite of negative 10 is positive 10 and then we have plus 3 and 1/4 so now that we've changed subtraction to adding the opposite who is correct who do you agree with Sam or Shem you very good Shamir is correct he is correct because when you add the opposite every number is positive and is being added today we will use this kind of reasoning to help us determine if our answers are reasonable let's get started here's our next problem hummingbirds sip 2 and 1/2 fluid ounces of the food in a feeder then 1 and 1/2 fluid ounces are added to the feeder last hummingbirds sipped another 3 and 1/4 fluid ounces of food what is the overall change in the amount of food in the feeder let's write an expression that represents this situation I'm going to pause so that you can go ahead and write an expression on your paper did you get negative 2 & 1/2 plus 1 and 1/2 minus 3 and 1/4 I hope so why are the 2 and 1/2 and the 3 and 1/4 negative is the 3 and 1/4 actually negative both of these numbers represent food being taken away from the feeder so yes when we add the opposite so remember this phrase that we've used adding the opposite leave this at end to leave this at end and remember that we add the opposite the opposite of 3 and 1/4 is negative 3 and 1/4 so yes both of these values are negative and they are negative because they represent food being taken from the feeder so now we have this expression why is the 1 in 1/2 positive it's positive because it represents the amount being added to the feeder do you think the overall change in the amount of food will be positive or negative why do you think that did you say that the answer will be negative great there is more food being taken away than is being added good job when you look at what's being taken away what's being taken away is more than what's being added so the overall amount of food is going to be negative great now let's determine the answer I will show you one way that we can simplify our expression we will talk through it together so the first thing that I'm going to do is decompose this negative 2 and 1/2 and I can decompose this negative 2 & 1/2 to be negative 1 & 1/2 plus negative 1 so before we before excuse me before we move on with the rest of this expression let's concentrate on why this can be decomposed so I'm not changing the value of this number I'm just decomposing it and writing it in a way that will make my addition and subtraction a little bit easier as we move along so negative 1 & 1/2 plus negative 1 does equal negative 2 and 1/2 we've just decomposed it to make our work a little bit easier I'm gonna continue on with writing the rest of this expression so plus 1 in 1/2 plus negative 3 and 1/4 now how do the decomposing help me and why why would we go through the time of decomposing math well negative 1 & 1/2 + 1 & 1/2 are opposites of one another and remember that when you add opposites they equal zero so when I add the negative 1 and 1/2 plus 1 in 1/2 they equals 0 so to continue simplifying my expression and I have negative 1 plus negative 3 and 1/4 I'm going to add those numbers together to get negative 4 and 1/4 now let's talk about what that answer means in the context of our problem and whether or not it is reasonable so remember when we had a conversation a second ago we talked about whether the overall change would be positive or negative and we said that it would be negative because there is more being taken away than is being added in and we did get a final answer that's negative so it is reasonable what does this negative 4 and 1/4 mean right it means that the overall change in the amount of food in the feeder was negative 4 and 1/4 fluid ounces great work okay let's try another one a helicopter is 19 and 1/4 meters above the top of a canyon wall it goes down 27 and 1/2 meters passing into the canyon then it goes up 5 and 1/4 meters what is the new position of the helicopter relative to the top of the canyon wall [Music] okay so what strategies have we learned this week that might help us solve this problem you are correct we can draw a diagram or we could draw a number line both of those are great ideas let's draw a diagram and see if that helps us with our expression we're gonna start out with the top of the canyon wall and we know that the helicopter is 19 and 1/4 meters above the top of the canyon wall we'll label that as our helicopter so here's the top of the canyon wall the helicopter is 19 and 1/4 meters above the top of the canyon wall what happens to the helicopter first right it goes down 27 and 1/2 meters so how can I show that the helicopter goes down 27 and 1/2 meters good so I'm gonna draw myself an arrow down showing that it's going down now when I draw this arrow down is the helicopter so it would be above the canyon wall on the canyon wall level with the canyon wall below the camel excuse me below the canyon wall right because it's doing going down 27 and 1/2 meters it's going to go down below the top of the canyon wall are we finished right then the helicopter goes up 5 and 1/4 meters now if it goes back up 5 and 1/4 meters is it going to be back level with the top of the canyon wall above the canyon wall where's it going to end up that right so we're going to show that it goes up 5 and 1/4 meters but it doesn't look like it's gonna make it back to the top of the canyon wall ok so now that we have our sketch or a diagram to help us out with this let's write an expression if the helicopter starts at 19 and 1/4 meters and then drops 27 and 1/2 meters how could we represent that you are correct we can subtract how would we then represent that it's rising 5 and 1/4 meters right again we could add so what would our expression look like to represent this problem go ahead and write it now I hope the expression that you came up with is 19 and 1/4 + excuse me we're gonna start out with subtraction actually the first thing that it did was decrease so we're not starting out with a plus so subtract 27 and 1/2 plus 5 and 1/4 let's double-check this real quick to make sure it makes sense so the helicopter started out 19 and 1/4 meters above the top of the canyon wall why it's positive it went down 27 and 1/2 meters that's why we've used subtraction and then it went up 5 and 1/4 meters so we've used addition so what would our answer be you go ahead and work out the problem and then I'll work the problem out and we can compare answers okay so I'm going to rewrite this remember that we talked about how you can reorder addition so that it's a little bit easier to work with so I'm going to reorder this so that I have 19 and 1/4 plus 5 and 1/4 together and then I'm going to subtract the 27 and 1/2 so when I add 19 and 1/4 plus 5 and 1/4 I get 24 and 2/4 remember that 2/4 is the same as 1/2 so 19 and 1/4 plus 5 and 1/4 is 24 and 2/4 which is 21 and 1/2 excuse me 24 and 1/2 and then we're going to be subtracting the 27 and 1/2 so what is 24 and 1/2 subtract 27 and 1/2 you are correct it is negative 3 did you get that answer awesome so what does the negative 3 mean in the context of the problem that's right it means that the helicopter is 3 meters below the top of the canyon if you go back to our drawing it does make sense that if it started here went down 27 and 1/2 meters came back up 5 and 1/4 2 meters it is going to be 3 meters below the top of the canyon wall awesome work you're really doing a great job let's work some more problems as we work the problem think about whether the answer you get is reasonable ask yourself does your answer make sense in the situation just like we did here we thought about whether this negative 3 made sense in the situation just like we did with our hummingbird problem where we thought about the fact that our final answer was negative made sense because there was more being taken away than there was being added in so here's our next problem CiCi's dog loses 1 and 1/4 pounds then her dog loses one and one eight pounds finally he gains three eighths pounds what is the total change in her dog's weight show your work remember to think about the different strategies you can use to help you understand and solve the problem when you finish check to make sure your answer makes sense I'm going to pause for about a minute while you work this out and think about whether your answer makes sense and then we'll come back together and solve this okay let's look at this problem together what expression did you write to solve this situation see if yours matches mine negative 1 and 1/4 minus 1 and 1/8 plus 3/8 okay why is this 1 and 1/4 negative right because the dog loses 1 and 1/4 pounds why is this one in 1/8 negative right because the dog loses another one in 1 8 pounds and then why have we added a positive 3/8 here right because the dog gains 3/8 pounds okay so let's do some subtracting here keep in mind when we start with our subtraction that we're going to need a common denominator you have a common denominator of 8 here so negative 1 and 1/4 is the same as negative 1 and 2 8 instead of subtracting I am going to add the opposite like we've been working on so I'm gonna change subtraction to addition and then the opposite of 1 and 1 8 is negative 1 and 1 8 and then we still have plus 3/8 so just a second ago when we were talking I asked you why is this negative this one and 1/8 negative and you can see by adding the opposite that it is in fact a negative 1 and 1 8 because the dog is losing those pounds all right so negative 1 and two eighths plus negative one and one eight is negative two and 3/8 then we're going to add 3/8 so what is our final answer you're correct negative two so what does this mean right CiCi's dog lost two pens does that answer make sense well we can use the whole numbers to check the dog lost a little over a pound then it lost a little over another pound so that's a loss of a little over two pounds then it gained a little less than half a pound back so it would still have lost close to two pounds great work here's another problem in chemistry class Kari is mixing solutions together for an experiment she mixes 5 and 1/2 ounces of solution a and 8 and 3/4 ounces of solution B she then needs to remove 3 and 1/4 ounces before adding 6 and 3/4 ounces of solution C what is the volume of her final solution write the expression solve this problem check to see if your answer is reasonable and then we'll go over it together let's go over this problem to figure out how many Ounces carrie has in her experiment let's write the expression 5 and 1/2 plus 8 and 3/4 minus 3 and 1/4 plus 6 and 3/4 so we do need a common denominator here when we add these together remember that 5 and 1/2 is 5 and 2/4 keep the rest of our expression okay so remember that we do addition and subtraction in order from left to right so 5 + 2/4 + 8 and 3/4 is 14 and 1/4 now let's subtract 3 and 1/4 14 and 1/4 minus 3 and 1/4 is 11 now we'll add 6 and 3/4 so carries experiments volume is 17 and 3/4 ounces did you get it great work let's do one more problem together this one is about hummingbirds hummingbirds sip 3 and 3/4 fluid ounces of the food in a feeder then 8 and 1/2 fluid ounces are added to the feeder last hummingbirds sip another 4 and 3/4 fluid ounces of food what is the overall change in the amount of food in the feeder work this problem and then we'll go over it together let's see how you set up this situation negative 3 and 3/4 plus 8 and 1/2 minus 4 and 3/4 why of our 3 and 3/4 and 4 and 3/4 negative right they are negative since the hummingbirds have sipped the food here we need a common denominator 8 and 1/2 is the same as 8 and 2/4 negative 3 and 3/4 plus 8 and 2/4 is 4 and 3/4 now let's subtract 4 and 3/4 wait that's 0 what does that mean in this problem you're correct there isn't a change in the amount of food in the feeder it is the same does that answer make sense why it does make sense because the amount that was sipped is the same as the amount that was added so there is a zero fluid ounce change in the amount of food in the feeder great works at a seventh grade today we were reviewed using addition and subtraction of rational numbers to solve real-world problems with a focus on fractions you sure did a great job after the video you will have some problems to practice on your own I will show you the independent practice problems now here they are or you can find them in the student practice for this lesson posted on our website WWE in guv slash education good luck and do your best here are those problems if you'd like to take a look at them now all right guys I enjoyed reviewing how to use adding and subtracting

using the brush that came with the kit as well and so and the watercolor paper I believe it's probably Tim Holtz watercolor it's really really white so I am just laying down some color some super fun color here and they don't have the traditional rainbow colors so I kind of had to mix the yellow and the pink to get sort of a orange e-type but I did that heat set it and then went back for a second layer because I did want a bit of a pop on this these watercolors are really beautiful but I did want some more pigment type look so I went through I did that again and then of course I heat set that the second time so that I can continue to work because I'm ever so impatient right here I'm grabbing my mini Misti out and I am laying out the little paint palette the paint tube and then the sentiment and I am gonna use some versafine onyx black ink because I really want this with the textured paper to really show up bold and bright well bright if you can black ink can be bright but um so I'm doing that I'm doing it twice because again the texture I really want it to be stark that's the word I'm looking for stark okay so once that's done I'm kind of figuring out what pattern paper or what paper I want to go with it I like this pink and so I'm gonna use some stitched rectangle dies from lawn fawn to cut out both my pal my panel and the pink and then I am going to spray this with some shimmer spray I really advocate for this shimmer spray it's wonderful it seriously is like taking your spectrum you are Sparkle pen all over your project you can't see it on the video which is so sad it makes me really sad that you can't however trust me it gives this beautiful just sparkle so I'm gonna use some fun foam on the back of that panel and then I realized that I wanted some black mat around it just on the sides because I wanted that to kind of pop out with the top panel and so then I add that to the bottom layer which is the pink cardstock that came with the kit it's one of the patterned papers that came with the kit so I'm going to use my tombow mono on that and then I am going to set it pulling out my I call score buddy and I am going to use my hu size card here getting it down with my Ivy's a 110 pound Neenah solar white and then I'm gonna take my tombow again I'm going to put that onto the panel or the base and I'm almost done with the card this card was really easy to make but I am gonna pull out some new faux drops so I bought that Evo drops because I said I have to have the Nuvo drops and lo and behold I'm not finding all that many uses so I have to really pull those out and get to it and so here I thought what better thing to add to a palette than these drops there you go so I've added those and that will finish up the card I'd love to hear from you if you have any comments and don't forget to hit subscribe because I'm gonna have these six cards in a set featuring this kit post every couple days and so I would hate for you to miss the fun along the way I will list everything I used below and until next time I hope you have a wonderful day bye bye", "bzVTV4kvxG4": "[Music] hey everybody thanks so much for stopping back to the us normally channel if you want to know how to make these delicious pumpkin bars with a secret ingredient go ahead and keep watching all right let me pull up my recipe again alright so let me see what else I need for eggs okay for ace butter [Music] my applesauce oh my god and my pumpkin my flour baking powder baking soda vanilla cinnamon powdered sugar so do you guys have watching our videos you know that I like quick simple five ingredient three ingredient one ingredient recipes that is not what I'm gonna show you today because I'm actually making pumpkin bars legit pumpkin pies from scratch this is my mother's recipe so there's a little bit more to it but I've made them before they always turn out really well so we're gonna go ahead and make them tonight a nice fall treat we're gonna go ahead and preheat our oven to 350 degrees okay so the first thing we're gonna do is beat the eggs sugar oil and pumpkin together so I need a bowl [Music] okay there goes the four eggs hopefully you guys can see this we don't have a viewfinder on our camera so that makes it a little bit hard to see exactly what I'm doing but Steve made this cool weird contraption really know how he did it or what it is but it's essentially a viewfinder but since I'm vlogging I can't really hook it up because it's like this big screen so okay there's our four eggs and then let's see we need 3 1 and 2/3 cups of sugar [Music] and then if you guys saw instead of buying oil because I asked for one cup of oil I didn't actually get oil instead here is my secret ingredient it's actually apple sauce that you use in place of oil so not only is using apple sauce instead of oil a lot healthier for you it actually makes your recipe taste a lot better it makes it just more like soft and more moist and so that is a tip in a trick that my mom taught me I think when I was in high school and I actually use it in place of oil I need to have baking something and it makes the world of a difference so secret ingredient right here okay and then you actually just use the exact same proportion so this calls for one cup of oil so I'm just gonna use one cup of apple sauce I need to have the pumpkin in been putting off making my pumpkin burst I don't really know why made my pumpkin chocolate chip cookies and that kind of got me my pumpkin fix but I like to make these a couple of times during the fall and I can't have it yet so I figure October is coming to an end so might better butter get to baking and today is like it is seriously like the perfect fall weather it's like 53 degrees outside I've got the open there is a million leaks in our backyard okay it looks really pretty all of our trees look really pretty okay so now we have the eggs sugar oil and pumpkin so now we have to beat them together oh that's our not quite done with the recipe yet so here's what it will look like when those are all blended together okay let's see then we have to add our flour baking powder cinnamon baking soda and salt okay add our flour we need two cups flour [Applause] [Music] two teaspoons two tablespoons of [Music] okay one teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon [Music] I'm just gonna kind of twist all of that together then we're gonna go ahead and add our dry ingredients into the wet ingredients draw this together then once it's all evenly stirred just make sure you get all the chunks out at the bottom it kind of gets a little lumpy then we're gonna put it into a 10 by 15 by 1-inch ungreased pin bake at 350 degrees which my oven is already preheated and then we're gonna bake for 25 to 30 minutes okay now that I have my piano just go ahead and dump this all away I think I'm using a bit bigger of a pan but we've always made it in this and they turn out just it's definitely deeper than one page but it will work just make sure it's kind of evenly spread out okay this is what its gonna look like YUM go ahead and open up the oven you'll set the kitchen timer for I'm gonna do 25 then we'll check on it once it's done all right it looks like we have about three and a half minutes left and that's how they're looking so far so while I'm finishing that we're gonna go ahead and make the cream cheese the cream cheese frosting so for the cream cheese frosting okay so it calls for one eight ounce package of cream cheese sorry I'm looking at my phone three tablespoons of butter 2 teaspoons of vanilla and three cups of powdered sugar so and then it says blend the cream cheese vanilla and butter then gradually add the powdered sugar cream cheese is end we need three tablespoons of butter and then 2 teaspoons of vanilla usually just a couple of capfuls and then we're gonna go ahead and blend those together oven beeping to let me know that bars are done how they look look nuns Oh go ahead and take this out put it right here and then of course you do the toothpick test right in the middle if it comes out clean they're good pretty good cool so we're gonna let that cool off I'm gonna finish making the process and we need a cup I'm actually going to do it one cup at a time I write to Dubai I've never actually made my own perhaps before so this is first for me intrigue tester okay [Music] Hey I don't know if that's gonna be enough but and here it is that's what looks like I'll probably maybe stir mm-hmm stir it around a little bit more but I kind of got I kind of was flying everywhere so let's see so I just have to wait for the pumpkin bars to completely cooled before I add the frosting so that will probably so I will wait until that's completely cool and then I'll add the cream cheese and I'll show you guys what it looks like once I'm finished there at the pumpkin bars there's the cream cheese frosting we're gonna go ahead and try it's not like totally cool but I'm gonna gonna try it anyways first pumpkin Mars of the season and this is the finished product and I mean to go ahead and grab it a nice hand and this makes 24 arms again if you guys liked this buy this video go ahead and give it a thumbs up comment below what you guys want to see from us in the next video and be sure to subscribe thanks yeah [Music]", "njynxhrGTEk": "hello 5th graders we're back again for our lesson for Thursday April 2nd so hopefully the test went alright yesterday on percents I think at moto is showing you how you did right away I think I put that in there if not I know I can see how you guys did on that so we're gonna go ahead today and move into chapter 11 so you will need your textbook today and some paper notebook for you if you want to practice with us while we're doing it here okay so we are gonna chapter 11 is called graphs and probability so are you looking at a few different skills here in this lesson so for now we're gonna start on page 139 okay and today we're gonna be focusing on a line plot so you might remember these remember a waiting room is line right so it has a line like a number line and then plotting points putting little X's on that line above it depending on the type of data you have so you guys probably remember line plots from the last couple of years I think we've done them all right so we're looking at line plots but you'll notice that the numbers on the number line here in this example are in fraction form so that's what makes it a little more challenging versus what you did in third grade so let's look at our problem it says Emma carried out a science experiment yay am i you're in here famous right she measured the volumes of colored water in ten identical bottles and recorded her data in a table so basically you know these bottles are pretty small I guess or actually I guess she's they're in fractions of a quart right so remember the way you kind of read this is that two of the bottles only had one eighth of a quart in them filled four of the bottles had a fourth two of the bottles had three eighths and two of the bottles had a half quart that they were filled with whatever colored water something yes colored water all right so I just want to kind of review how that line plot works because you'll be making some of those for your homework right so remember you start with a line any line goes on forever so it's got arrows on the end okay and then you look at your data so the volume the lowest volume is an eighth of a quart so we want to start with that and then we have 1/4 3/8 and 1/2 okay now they do have zero on there but this is fine if you as long as you have the the numbers that go with the data we need okay so again remember there are two bottles that had 1/8 of a quart so that's why there's two x's there four bottles out of four two bottles had 3/8 and two bottles had a half quart okay now also when we're creating a line plot it is important to add a label right underneath under otherwise we don't really know what we're talking about so that's why they have this is these numbers represent volume colored water and it's also very important to put the unit right whatever you're measuring in is if milliliters is it quartz as it cups in this case because the volume right it's so important to have that information okay so that's the first thing is just remembering how to create a line plot but the second part here's where all that math the math skills come in but if you turn to page 140 so question a says what is the total volume of the colored water in the ten bottles right so they want us to figure out how many quarts are in all of these bottles right if she was to pour it all into one big teener how much would be in there so this is where we need to do some math you can kind of see what's going on here in your textbook basically starting with the 1:8 there are two of those right so that's two groups of 1/8 so we can just times right and a lot of you can probably well if I have to one ace that equals two eighths right up or you can think of it like this where you make the frak the to look like a fraction right so 2 times 1 is 2 1 times 8 is 8 okay so the total for this set right here is two eighths of a quart all right so this one there are four one fourths well for one fourths right is really four fourths which equals one right so this set of bottles equals one quart three eighths there are two of them so again you could do two times 3/8 or it might be easier just to think like this right because that's the same thing when you time something by two you're just adding it to itself right so 3/8 plus 3 days is 6 eighths so that's our total for this column here and then we know that two halves here because this is a half and a half would equal oh right so this one equals one whole court as well so then you gotta take all of that add all those totals together right so one plus one is two and then six eighths plus two ace right that makes eight eighths which basically is one more hole that will add to here right so that's a total of three quarts in all of these bottles okay so yes it is gonna take you a little while right there's a lot of work to that okay all right and then the last of questions that you'll see it says so that's one of the things they'll ask you right after you do your line plot is to total up the amounts okay and then the last one is in the example be the total volume of the colored water in the ten bottles is redistributed equally into each bottle what is the volume of colored water in each bottle now so what they're saying is that yeah she just basically dumped all of the water into one big container and then she wanted to re you know pour it back into each one so that there's the same amount of liquid in each bottle okay so that means we need to take our total which is three quarts and split that into ten equal parts so how do you split something into equal groups if you have the total that's division right but just be careful right what is our number that we're starting with what is our total amount of water it's three so we're really doing three and we're splitting that into ten parts right 3 divided by 10 now in this case these are fractions right so we can just leave it as 3/10 which looks like the fraction 3/10 right so 3/10 of a court would go in each one of the bottles and then they would have equal amounts okay all right so we're gonna try the guided learning problem and then that's gonna be it for today so we're gonna try the guided learning problem on page 140 it's another one of these without the answers already provided all right so it says the table shows the weights of the raisins in 12 bags of trail mix ok so now we're doing weight instead of volume so number 1 the first thing they want us to do is make the line cloth so remember you're gonna start with a line and you can do this with me if you want for practice probably be a good idea all right so this send me up a lot we have a lot of different weights here right so our lowest weight is 1/2 then we've got 3/4 one whole one and 1/4 all right now we're getting into some mixed numbers one and a half one and three-fourths and - ok and we know that our weight of the reasons is in ounces okay all right so then we just need to look at our number of bags of each so there's one here for the half two of the 3/4 - yeah - 1 ounce bags three of the 1 and 1/4 1 1 and 1/2 1 1 and 3/4 and two of the 2 ounce bags ok should that's it for number one you just have to create the line plot okay now for the fun part what number two what is the total weight of the raisins in the 12 bags ok so again this is the part you know there's a lot to do here so you just have to be patient and you know take your time and list things ok so that we can make sure we get this total correct ok so of course this one is just 1/2 right 1/2 an ounce ok now this is two sets of three fourths okay so that's three fourths plus three fourths which is 3 plus 3 6 fourths okay I'm just gonna kind of keep a tally down here right all right there are two one ounces so one plus one that's two so that's nice alright here we go get into a little more complicated here now my suggestion you don't have to do well there's a couple ways you can do it right so this is a one on one for all right so I know that this is a 3-1 in one fourths right so that's 3 and 3/4 right 3 and 3/4 now it might be easier to change this into 5/4 and then you can do it that way but I mean 1 and 1/4 if you add it 3 times right is gonna be 1 2 3 and then 1/4 plus 1/4 plus 1/4 is 3/4 that's how I did that ok all right there's only 1 1 and 1/2 1 1 and 3/4 and then we have 2 bags that have 2 ounces each right so that's 2 plus 2 is 4 okay so these are our totals from each column now we need to go back and combine right so what I might do first here is add up my whole numbers right so I'm gonna circle them as I add them so that I don't get confused so 2 plus 3 that's 5 6 7 and then 7 plus 4 is 11 so so far Matt 11 okay all right so then I now I need to add all the fraction parts okay so the first thing I might go ahead and do is I knew that 1/2 plus 1/2 is one more so I'm gonna add that right and then I have these fourths left ok so why don't you first I'm just gonna add them all up so 6 fourths plus 3/4 that's 9 fourths and then 3 more is 12 4 that's a total of 12 fourths right 6 plus 3 is 9 3 more is 12 forts okay 9 12 divided by 4 or 12 force right we can just divide that to change it in this actually comes out nice and neat and even as a whole number because 12 divided by 4 is 3 that's nice okay so now I just need to add that to these two right 11 plus 1 is 12 plus 3 more is 15 ounces right so that is the total weight of all those bags of raisins okay all right so last question says number 3 if these raisins were distributed equally among the 12 bags what would be the weight of the raisins in each bag okay this is just like that colored water problem so we have a total of 15 ounces and we want to split that into twelve equal parts so we're gonna do 15 divided by 12 right we're gonna do 15 divided by 12 now for this problem since we're doing things in fraction form I'm just gonna do this we know it's not gonna come out evenly right but let's go ahead and do the long division then we'll just change it into a fraction so 12 can go into 15 once with a remainder of 3 so that is 1 + 3 12 and then this can be reduced of course you want to make sure you reduce right divided by 3 so we get 1 3 goes into itself once 12 goes into 3 4 times so each bag would have 1 and 1/4 ounces of raisins okay all right so that's the answer there so that's enough for today that's a lot to take in and for your homework tonight you're gonna be doing workbook let's see here you're doing workbook page I lost it in 102 through 104 okay so you we're doing three pages doing these different things that we worked on where you're making a line plot totaling up all the amounts together and then and they'll give you a question where you have to split them back evenly okay so again it's pages 102 103 and 104 in your workbook all right so you want to do those tonight again remember get on Edmodo when you view this assignment click on the create text box I did my homework that way I can give you credit all right so that's it for today take care bye bye", "9QI6Qn9uZss": "hey there welcome back and thanks for joining me all my supplies and equipment are down in the description box below and they have links so check that out if you'd like this video hit that subscribe button and if you want to be notified when new videos come out hit that notification bell and remember to give me a thumbs up that lets me know that you're enjoying the videos and questions and comments are welcomed all right these are the colors i think i'm using there these are the ones i've i might grab some more but you know if they do i'll i'll try to remember rhyme down so let's go um i've had a lot of questions here lately about what's in my little bottle alcohol it's either 91 or 99 depending on what i got um isopropyl alcohol so that is what's in this and i do fail to say that so what i'm want to do i'm back and forth on do i want a background or do i just want white i think the background will help me a little bit so i'm going to do this now what i'm going to do is blue and green i want it very very very very light so i'm going to try to do that so i'm going to put quite a bit of alcohol here and i'm going to put only i think a couple of drops one and two now what would be a lot easier in this case is to go ahead and have this mixed up in one of these bottles and to load it down with alcohol um i have a lot of these i just don't know what colors they are so i need to redo all my stuff like that so i'm gonna swirl this around and try to keep it somewhat in a framed but you know every time i say that i don't so maybe quit saying that [Applause] god all right so there's that um now where's my moss we'll do the same thing with that i'm only going to do one drop because that two was just too much so okay so the top's gonna have some movement in it that's fine i'm gonna go ahead and put it on the bottom two then oh i do not like the fingers i usually get those when i don't have enough alcohol down and i'm just trying to make do that's usually when they show up okay i need to move on i've spent enough time on that background and i didn't get what i originally went for so that's just the way it is sometimes but this is fine i think it'll be fine i just i didn't want the background to be a huge part of it okay um think think think think okay i was going to do and i've got this smaller shot glass i think that'll be okay or do i want to use one of these no i'm going to use this because i'm only going to put a few maybe maybe five you know me in numbers um so what i'm gonna do is put down a little bit of alcohol and i'm going to do maybe a little bit of it one color and put another drop of another color and just see what they do i'm not going to mix them unless i see that it's not doing great and then i'll i'll do something okay flamingo and some bright yellow and some alcohol shot glass i'll do one here um put that down have your blow dryer ready because you're gonna need it yeah i didn't plan on doing that but it seemed like a fun thing to do let's see how that mixes [Applause] because remember when you dry the alcohol that's run out from underneath the glass the inside's still wet you can still blow it around a little bit and you've got enough of a barrier that oh no no no no don't do that um you can blow it around i didn't want it getting outside i wanted really really nice rounds so you know i'm i had wondered before if i could put some more pieces of paper towel underneath and make it to where i could push it down harder and it would kind of seal up a little bit better okay pull that off yeah so we're gonna have to doctor this up a little bit i'm still okay with it i just not kind of what i was wanting because i didn't want that but let's try it let's try what we had said about putting the extra down and see what that does it may or may not okay if it works it's fabulous if it doesn't we're no better we're no worse off all right i think probably the small ones would have been really cute but i've already started and i want all them the same so we'll just do this right there this time i think i'm going to do some purple these are bubbles but we're going to do leaf like things to maybe indicate that they might be flowers but they're still bubbles and just have fun with it no it's not doing it oh it's coming out good gum so either one i used too much alcohol which i didn't think i did i mean it is running to the outside like nobody's business all right i'm gonna do this i'm losing i'm losing my battle okay at this point i really do want to toss it but i'm not gonna because you just never know but i am disappointed okay keep going um i'm doing here a little bit quit running there we go all right let's see what this does i did put less alcohol and it's still running out geez so maybe the paper towels aren't a great idea in my head it worked out perfect [Applause] okay yeah all right now i'm gonna kind of let's just take that out do one here what colors do i want to do pink and yellow again of course i splatted of course why not i tell you this painting thing is ups and downs one minute you do something fabulous and you're like yep i have arrived and the next time that painting humbles you down to i need to take some beginner courses it's just amazing the uh the the difference in what these paintings do but that's all right we we know enough skills and that is where i'm like learn skills learn techniques we know enough to pull us out of this and that's what we're going to do we're going to pull out this but definitely learn your techniques because had i done this two months after i started out it'd little bit in the floor thrown away but now i'm like i've got so many things under my belt that i can usually pull it out or at least play enough to play and learn [Music] and that's that's what we want to do this i i don't know if i want to bother that or not but um okay and we'll do another one over here um i'm gonna do purple and pink should i yes i should do purple pink it's a little bit there a little bit there yeah this is this is getting messy [Applause] so [Applause] i want to fill up this white so when i put my own white in it it won't [Applause] it won't mess with it it won't make it look odd [Applause] and see how just having the shot glass arounds created a perimeter it will run over it but you stand a better of a chance not to okay so let's let's go to the next thing um and we'll leave those alone for a minute i'm a little mad at them um okay so on the acrylic part i'm going to do these two the sap green which matches the moss really well so we'll do some of that and we'll do some blue because those two go together really well i'm going to do i'm going to go back and forth here so i'm going to take my card do a couple i'm going to do some like a straight for the stem a little bit more than that okay i really want them touching but i'm not going to because you know that's neat um okay that's all i'm doing right now what i'm going to do is take a flat brush i so had it just right there what in the world oh there it is okay i'm going to do maybe some grass things i'm not going to worry about doing leaves but i want to do some little grass things and i'm going to do it where i'm holding my brush straight like this and then turn and then come back like that and instead of trying to paint like this do your whole arm it just it's for me it's easier to do something like that um these are now i'm gonna get these dry first okay now we'll get some of that we'll start over here i need some more of this so that was pretty easy and we'll do one this way i don't know this one i can see what i'm doing coming toward me it's a little harder but it may be just an angle i think they're about the same and we'll try one side by side well yeah i do i do want to try one side by side let's do this i'm gonna start out thick that's really bright really bright wow okay i didn't want that right there i like the little bigger blades all right that's all i'm doing okay back to the card um i want to do some just messy like that do yeah i like making it go up into that okay so let's tackle those things so i'm going to have to use some more colors um white no let me think what i'm gonna do yeah white ink where's my white acrylic now if i want them to be white which while we're doing this craziness might as well um i need to spray it let me think if i'm gonna do anything else no okay i'll be back i'm gonna go spray with kmart varnish now hold this if you if i sprayed really close it's going to activate this somehow it will splotch it up and it's no good stay 15 18 inches away you know i just kind of stand there and missed it so try that if you're having trouble with it and i'll be right back okay i am back so i've got it dried and okay let me just i'm gonna do black and i'm gonna do white so i've got my white here uh this is my black bombay i don't know that i want to use bombay we've got that black cinelier cinelyer i never knew how to pronounce that okay so i got that so here's the two all right all right so i'm going to stamp on them with my shot glass um we'll clean it off real quick and then i wanna i think i want to um shadow it with black okay that's clean i need a bigger piece of paper all right there we go it doesn't have other colors on it okay all right let's do it i don't want it gigantic and stop be wet but i do need something there yeah so we'll do let's see this one i'm gonna put over it now don't be too alarmed when you see it it drawn up it's it's sitting on something that's not accepting it now so now it's going to be a little um beady it's going to beat up a little bit now if you don't mind it being like the color that you're putting it on it kind of pulling some of the purple or yellow then by all means don't spray it and then just put the white over it because it will influence it a little bit and that's a cool look too i just you know made a choice and went with it i kind of want these a little after i said i don't want them dark i do want them dark i definitely want them visible now i'm just going to do the white highlights um like here and that's what i'm talking about it beaten up it's but you know this that's where you make a call and kind of go with it yeah it's easier when you just do it and not try to fix it like i was doing there okay so there's that i didn't want the white to take in all the colors so i sprayed it but now you know it acts differently so i like it i'm fine with it i just want you to be aware that those are the options on it now i'm not sure what to do um i want them to look like bubbles really do so i want this highlight to be a little now once this acrylic has started drying it actually is taking on more acrylic a little bit easier so that seems like a good way to kind of correct that if that's not something you're wanting yeah i'm getting okay with that all right ah you know i just don't know what else i want to do um i could double wipe those but i think i'm going to leave them i really do i think i'm going to leave them and just make them look like they kind of did their thing i do want to splatter of course what i kind of do is want to take some of this yellow and pinks and purples and maybe splatter here not here or at least not right now so i'm going to take that and we'll do something i don't want to do half but i want to do about a little bit cover up a little bit more than half that means what kind of yellow do i have okay i need to add things to my list so no black and then it comes off yellow [Music] pink and purple so we're pulling some of these colors here but very lightly okay so here i don't have this purple i don't know why i thought i ordered it i thought i thought but apparently i do not so i'm going to mix mine some will take the blue that i've been using and believe it or not that hue of blue will pull in that purple so i'm technically still using some of my original colors there's that and i'm going to put this magenta beside it and then i'm going to put magenta over here and then i'm going to do my yellow here we'll mix these two and that blue took over and we'll scoot some over here i'm not going to color all that okay close yeah okay so that's the purple ish so i probably won't use a lot of it yeah it's not showing up much at all so i've got a little bit of it down there okay we'll screw it up just a little and put a little bit but not much like it's fading up into it i just don't want a sharp line that's kind of cute do i want even more um more than having more i would like bigger yeah i like that so i like the bigger ones not a lot of them just bigger okay that makes that makes it fun um in return i kind of want to do blue up here leave leave kind of a space yeah i don't think i like that as much so i'm glad i didn't do much um i do want some of the blue up toward here not much at all in fact i want it real blotchy so i'm going to pat off i had to have one going through a flower okay i like that i'm learning to stop i'm so excited i do but i do but i do want and i'm going to have to get a bigger brush if i want some more um bigger splats so i'm going to use a mop brush love these um yeah they're they're absolutely incredible i'll try to remember if i don't already have them in my i don't think i do um gosh love them not i need more water it was pretty thick that's all i want that is all i want okay i'm gonna look at it to my camera and see it's kind of cute all right yep i think i'm gonna stop i think i'm gonna stop all right y'all go have fun", "rXgDZbY_zxk": "[Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so [Music] do [Music] oh do baking powder my oats and my protein powder add in our wet ingredients and a little bit of soy milk and then just combine all of that until it's nice and thick this next step you can really add whatever you like into this i like blueberry banana bread that's my favorite but if you really like chocolate you can add in chocolate chips some powdered peanut butter for some extra protein and a little bit of peanut butter flavor really just add in whatever you like to this you could put in some almonds or chia seeds or some nuts i have these little baking trays that are nonstick and again i have to use these because i don't have an oven so i'm putting this into my air fryer but feel free to use a normal loaf pan that you would use just for any kind of banana bread we're just going to be putting that into our loaf pan make sure that they are non-stick if they aren't you might want to spray it with a tiny bit of olive oil just so it doesn't get super stuck and then what i like to do is i like to put a little bit extra blueberries on top because when they cook they look really cool and it just kind of gives it a nice decorative look and then i also like to add some coconut flakes on top as well then we're just going to bake these for about 30 to 45 minutes you're really going to have to watch these and do the toothpick method to make sure that it's coming out clear before you cut it make sure that you let it cool completely i just threw these in the fridge and then they released from the pan really easily but it's super good on its own i like to put some jam on it or maybe even a little bit of vegan butter it's amazing next we're going to be making tempeh bacon wraps these have 398 calories each and 20 grams of protein lots of fiber lots of veggies super super delicious if you guys have never made tempeh bacon you got to try it i like to use this light life brand because it has minimal ingredients it doesn't have any oil or anything and what we're going to do is just slice this as thinly as we can into little kind of like bacon slices this is about how thin you want them to be in a bowl we're going to add in some tamari which you can substitute soy sauce or coconut aminos if you want a little bit of liquid smoke some maple syrup and then some garlic powder and just whisk all of that together and then we're just going to be putting our little tempeh strips in here and letting it marinate for a little bit so what i did was i cook this in a pan i i wouldn't recommend this unless you have a really really good non-stick pan i tried this in the airfryer after and it worked actually way better so if you don't have a really good non-stick pan i would highly recommend cooking this in your oven for the wraps i like to use these ezekiel wraps and the best thing to do with these as well is to get them a little bit warm before you try and roll them because they do tend to be a little bit on the firmer side and if you try to roll them after they were sitting in the refrigerator or just sitting out they might be too hard and break on you then we're just going to put whatever veggies we like into a pan i have some broccoli some peppers mushrooms and some onions and just let that saute in a little bit of coconut aminos until it's nice and tender this feta cheese you guys oh my god i'm obsessed with it if you have this feta cheese in your area i highly recommend trying it you can skip the cheese and this recipe you could put avocado on here you could put some hummus on here or you could use any other kind of vegan cheese that you like and then just add in whatever kind of other veggies you had so i just had some tomatoes that i added in there put everything together and just wrap that up nice and tight and these are so good oh my god i made four or five of these wraps in advance and just kept them in my fridge and i would just grab them after the gym and eat them so good thank you guys so much for watching this video if you liked it please give it a big thumbs up [Music]", "GfmpE8dyc9Q": "hello I'm here to show how I'm making my home DIY laundry powder and right now what you're saying is my grade my cheese grater that I use for myself too great myself up and the bowl I have it here I'm grading up three bars of this 4.1 ounce of pink soap soap I'm grading three balls of these okay I'm grading them up you can always buy the soap flakes but I bought a puppet they're white they have those sent I got pink soap because has a little scent too in this myth help is good this is what it looks like outside of the paper I've cut it in three parts because I'm grating it on top of this grader and I've learned from watching some of the other white to YouTube ladies and who make their own laundry soap it's best to grate it and let out I got it laid out on some for you to dry out or you can use cookie sheets you know to dry out to upset the graded soap on and to dry it out and the bowl here is strictly for my well this bow either I got another stainless steel bowl it's going to be strictly for my soap that I made and this knife so gonna be strictly for the soap I'm not going to be cooking or using these part of the site UM's for food or anything else just strictly for doing my DIY soap grating my soap and put my soap in it so i'ma grate it and all three bars then I'm gonna sit it on this foil to dry out and then I'll be back okay now I'm back it's in the more its make some hours later let it sit overnight on the foil as you can see it's not sticking together anymore because this is soap soap it's very it's very soft not very very soft but it's all like cheese and when you grain it it it tries to like come together in clumps so it still tries to stick together but I learned from watching some of the YouTube ladies and watching they calm reading the comments and some of the so under some of the videos some say laid out looking oh hi eight or out in the Sun on some foil and a cookie sheet so we can hurry up and dry out so as you can see it has dried out it's not trying to stick together so that's what I want to do you can still feel the soapy it still feels like soap but it's just not trying to clump together like clay you don't start trying it together alright so this is what I want to show you first foster soap and I'm take a measuring cup and measure one cup of each one of my product of each one of the ingredients I have out put a bowl and mix it together and I'll be back to show you their process okay I'm now in my laundry room and I'm showing you what all I'm using armie hammer washing soda and this is 55 ounces which is three pounds seven ounces armie hammer washing soda and here is our Muhammed pure baking soda four pounds 20 Mule Team borax which is four pounds 12 ounces and I have three boxes of this ultra pure deck stain fighter and booster this is a number two color safe bleach as you can see color safe bleach and these are one pound 13 ounces each you saw I already saw the soap soap and those are three bars of four point one ounce there were three fourteen point one ounce bars and what I have done was measure one cup to each one the powder that you saw and in here because you got to mix a little bit at a time I also have these pure X crystals right here got the skills to light using these periods crystals I'm using two different brands these are 28 inches apiece these were 397 so instead of me paying nine dollars for a 55 ounce bottle of the purest crystals I just spent like eight dollars in about two twenty eight ounces and it came to fifty six ounces but you know it was cheap at about two twenty eight bottles in buy one fifty six fifty five ounce bottle I know it's just a dollar but still pennies add up so anyway I might have to put a cup or at least a half a cup of each one of these and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get a cup as you can see and I'm going to pour it in here like so then I'm gonna get a cup I don't have any help with filming so I when it's by myself pour some of this in here like so hey I'm recording don't come down here with that damn report is in you and I'm using a long handle spoon in I'm going for dirty and I'm going to continue to add to this until I finish so I'll be back with the finished product okay okay this is the finished product well these are two and a half gallon buckets so I need a five-gallon bucket a little bit bigger and so you can get these buckets on move Leo you can get these buckets from new to the bakery and your local grocery store and ask them do they have any um empty move a butter whipped cream um bucket 5 gallon buckets and that's what I'm gonna do I'm going in see if they have any when I went the only half to two and a half gallons empty so I got those two with the lids and I'll clean them out real good with bleach and soap and water dried them out and I use them but I'm gonna go back and see if they have any 5 gallon buckets because I need a 5 gallon bucket for this because this tote made a total of five gallons this has um this is for my color clothes now I have a bucket that I have marked heavy white only as you can see and on you know white clothes only and this has to OxiClean de la oxy in it because um color clothes sometimes are colorfast and the top is hard to come off and hold on okay back this is what the one right here looks like the list looks the same except this one has OxiClean in it that's not so clean but la awesome oxy from Dollar Tree in there and this to me I'm using separating it because some cumin cloves the oxy will faded the oxy clean will faded cuz some clothes color clothes are colorfast you know that they bleed easily so that's for whites only this has Purex color safe bleach in it so this is what I'm using for my color clothes I'm gonna do some loads and I will do update by the end of this week or the end of next week or sometime next week I will do an update on how I like it ok I'll put the recipe below and if you want to try it you can comment thumbs up and you have a great I'm back again I also meant to tell you all you really need is of two tablespoons which is equal to 1/8 of a cup and if you get the oxy the LA awesome OxiClean from Dollar General from Dollar Tree rather um the scoop that's tender in that this is a 1/8 of a cup or 1 or 2 tablespoons so you can use this this is a look a little bit more but this is equal to 1/8 of a cup or two tablespoons this was in this the scoop that was 10:00 to LA awesome I see cleaner okay so you could use one of these versus using when you using liquid soaps I'm thinking about making a liquid kind I'm not sure oh I got stuff under my nails from scrub something from scrubbing anyways versus you know using that much up to the number for the eye and sometimes I have to use a little bit more he's our son close be dirty and you know food on his clothes you got to use a little more because most commercial soaps has tears in them and use em I'm hit a total with what I made my whites only I spent a total of 20 and say like $24 and with the one I made for my color clothes I spent a total of maybe $26 something to that effect but every month when I'm buying the commercial stuff that I need like the bleach and the powder whatever you spend over $30 a month I've been washing supplies every month and the way I've done it dis con last last me six months to a year depends on how much I wash how much I use so it's supposed to last a five-gallon bucket of washing soda before the last me a year Joe that's not going to happen because my mom my sister maybe my brother gonna be let me borrow let me get some soap from meek I know you got something let me get some you got that big bucket let me get someone so you know but what I don't spend every month on buying washing washing laundry detergent and the supplies for my laundry detergent I'm going to put that in a bake and that's how i'ma do that to see how much I'm actually going to save by the end of the year by making my own washing powder so wish me luck ladies and gentlemen now this is my last turn you have a nice son", "PIJsuIcvWZk": "we're at 7.7 a now in algebra one equation of a line modeling data we can often write the relationship between two variables as a linear equation you know when it's graphed it'll make a straight line that's a linear equation and this linear equation is a model of the situation we can use the model to make estimates or predictions about the amounts represented by the variables so remember in linear equations we can have several x and y values that will make the equation true we can list the values in a function table so we've got this equation 2x plus y equals 7 every single one of these X and y values will make this equation true and they make ordered pairs 0 7 is an ordered pair 1 5 is an ordered pair and if we use 0 for X 2 times 0 is 0 and we use 7 for y 0 plus 7 is 7c and they'll make it true okay so let's see what we've got here to make 50 pairs of earrings at cost tallis $6 prepare for the supplies if she buys her supplies in a larger quantity like in bulk she saves money and 200 pairs of earrings can be made for only $3 a pair wow she cuts her cost in half doesn't she so we're gonna let B be the number of earrings she makes and C be the cost per pair we're gonna assume that a linear relationship fits these data amounts so our ordered pairs are gonna be EC for X Y we can write a linear equation that fits the data so is X C is y and we end up with 50 pairs for $6 and 200 pairs for $3 in our function table there on the Left we can use the ordered pairs 50 comma 6 and 200 comma 3 as our x1 y1 x2 y2 we can find a linear equation so the first thing we do is find the slope using these two ordered pairs and we do our subtraction 3 take away 6 as our y2 minus y1 and 200 take away 50 as our x2 minus x1 and we get negative 3 over 150 now that simplifies to a negative 1 50th slope now we can use this ordered pair as our x1 y1 we could choose any one of these we want I could use 200 and and the 3 as excellent but I chose to use the 50 in the six so now we've got our point and our slope and we use the point point slope equation so we're going to do it in this form right here so our x and y are going to be e and C and then our X 1 is going to be 50 and our y 1 is going to be 6 C right here now we just solved the equation we have to use distributive property with the negative one-fiftieth and we get negative one-fiftieth e and when we multiply the negative one-fiftieth times negative 50 we get a positive one because it's 50 over 50 and a negative and a negative makes a positive so now we have a plus 1 and this minus 6 on this side has to go away we need to eliminate it to isolate that C to one side so going to add 6 to both sides with additive inverse and that gets rid of this is a zero pair and now we've got C equals negative one fiftieth E Plus 7 C now we can use this linear equation to predict the cost to prepare for 300 pairs of earrings so she makes more earrings assuming there's still a linear relationship it's in slope intercept form all we have to do is plug the 300 in where the e is and when we multiply negative 1 50th times 300 we get negative 300 over 50 50 goes into three hundred six times so we have a negative 6 when we add a negative 6 and a positive 7 we get a 1 so we know it's only a dollar a pair if she makes 300 pairs that's really gonna boost her profits won't it if she keeps the price the same all right so now let's take a look at coffee we've got a 48 ounce container of coffee cost 25 cents per ounce and a 32 ounce container a smaller container costs 27 cents per ounce the price went up four islands by two cents didn't it now if we assume a linear relationship fits these data amounts we can have ordered pairs s 4 X 1 and P 4 y 1 that'll be the size and the price we can write a function table with our x value and our y value as S&P 48-ounce is 25 cents per ounce 32 ounces 27 cents per and we write our ordered pairs 48 25 and 32 27 now we can find the slope first that's the first thing we do so we do our y2 minus y1 and our x2 minus x1 and we get 27 takeaway 25 is a 2 and 32 minus 48 is a negative 16 well that gives us a negative 1/8 slope see we just used this formula so now we got negative one-eighth slope we need to pick one of these ordered pairs and I chose this one so if we use 48 is the x1 and 25 is the Y one has our point and we have our slope of negative 1/8 we can write the point point-slope equation which is right here see and we're going to use P for our Y and s for our X we're going to use 25 for our y1 and 48 for our x1 and when we multiply distributive property negative 1/8 times s we get negative 1/8 s and negative 1/8 times negative 48 well that gives us a positive 48 over 8 let me simplify that to a 6 because 6 times 8 is 48 so now we've got negative 1/8 s plus 6 we need to get rid of the 25 on this side so we add 25 to both sides for additive inverse to make a zero pair that makes this get eliminated right here and we end up with just p equals negative 1/8 s plus we add these 31 see now it's in slope intercept form we can use this equation to predict the price of a 16 ounce can of coffee per ounce so we were at 48 and it was at 25 then when we went down to a smaller can to 32 the price went up to 27 so what would a 16-ounce can cost per ounce so we're the 6th the the X is we plug in the 16 see where the S was or it's the same thing as the X and 1/8 times a positive 16 gives us a negative 16 over 8 well that's a negative 2 negative 2 plus the 31 is 29 so we know if we bought a 16 ounce can we'd be paying 29 cents per ounce so the small of the can we have to pay per ounce see you buy a bigger quantity and you save money now it's not always true at the store sometimes you get a better deal for buying a smaller one you have to do the math all right so our next video is going to be seven point seven B and we're going to talk about the line of best fit and it's about clusters of data on a graph with several points of information and you draw a line that fits the data best okay if you want to go back in this video's description there's gonna be links to similar and previous videos on point-slope equation slope intercept equation of a line graphing using intercepts and slope from an equation all of those will be in here in the link the links will be in the description okay okay I hope you're having a good day this was a lot of information and I hope you understand these two examples and I'll see you next video keep up the good work bye", "tGAQbnsL7QQ": "well since prepper night hey and I have a day off them make a dessert tonight we thought we her dad and make one for when he comes home so we thought the perfect thing to make would be carrot cake and since it doesn't start with shortening it starts with oil you can mix it in a pan without a mixer so here's what we're going to ready to recipe and it's been a little tough to follow but we made it didn't we preparation we did alright here we go we're going to take our repair dry ingredients in your supplier flour and salt and sugar and I've substituted some of the fire with whole wheat flour so that's all the all the dry now we're going to put the wet in and the web is eggs and buttermilk and coit and vanilla Joanne vanilla good point scrape all that out gently mix that which is incorporated alright that's pretty good now we're going to put in pineapple and carrots and we'll give you all the all the ingredients below any amount there you go let's go ahead and put the raisins into that's why you leave the juice in the pineapple so that you can rehydrate an array for mixing that in there was also cinnamon in the dry ingredients did we sing cinnamon salt we said solvent ethical system okay and here we go cup of coconut a coke cup of walnuts Wow to my favorites yeah you could use pecans or walnuts either one so you don't like raisins to leave them out don't write me notes I didn't mean to hit you back up just a little bit sweetie get down in the bottom where there's just a little bit of that dry flour and we're going to bake this in a greased 9x13 baking dish I like glass but it cooks hot so you really have to watch it whatever you're cooking time is on most of your things most of your recipes you doesn't cut it down a little bit if you're going to use glass here we go what's in that plate over there these are carrot peelings for our rabbits good job okay here we go I'm gonna stop before I get to the bottom and make sure the flower is all mixed in it is this cake prepper areally has some redeeming qualities because it's got some new tree some nutrients and it's got the whole wheat far it's got four nice-size carrot we didn't even measure those carrots do it I don't think we did it looked about like tikka yes it's got some pineapple it's got some raisins it's got some nut so don't feel quite as guilty about eating this one because it's got some really good stuff good cake for some amount of diet you know some things for it well yeah a little piece of it might work ok when you think about that now let's put it here or we did okay let's get it looked it looks a little wet but you know what those reasons are going to hydrate and they're going to take up that moisture okay so we're going to put in the oven how long do the bake I believe it makes you one hour one hour okay we're going into a we're going into a preheated oven and we'll show you what it looks like when it comes out the cakes out of the oven now and it came out just gorgeous it is a golden brown and you can see bits of pineapple that floated to the top little flecks of coconut I will tell you the moment you smell this cake when you say oh there's a cake in the oven when you you know when you the first cent of it it's pretty much ready so just check it stick a toothpick in the center see when you insert it if that toothpick comes out pretty clean with just a few crumbs clean to it then it's ready and you can slightly under baked a cake if you cook it in glassware because when you take it out the oven it will continue to cook for a few minutes that's why I set this one on the rack because I knew it was done the moment it came out of the oven and I wanted to cool it off as quickly as possible I whipped up a simple cream cheese frosting that I'm going to spread on top and then I'm gonna let paladin prepper and preparatory and tell you what they think all right i'm back i drugged preparation skin from a an exciting street basketball game to taste the carrot cake let us know what you think first of all it looks beautiful oh good carrot cake is one of her favorite I love the walnuts and raisins is it moist enough yes it's perfect very moist think that's a keeper definitely a keeper all right well you heard it you saw how long it took to mix it up that's what's nice about making the cake that doesn't have shortening or butter in it if you use oil you just combine all the wet ingredients combine all the dry ingredients mix them together and put them in your pan it's really easy yep it's a beautiful cake I think you'll love it if you try it great way to use carrots and pineapple and nuts to make a delicious good for you cake catch for you and prepper", "RVZGiCw30zk": "hi everyone its Mary welcome back to the channel so I'm finally getting a chance to play with the March Simon Says Stamp kit holy moly I love this kit so much good stuff that came in it two stamp sets are you kidding me that's awesome way to step up your game Simon Says Stamp alright so here's just a quick look at everything there's unboxing videos you've probably seen them because I'm super late to the party okay right here I am using my mini Misti stamping out my guys in memento sorry I'm out of breath I just ran upstairs away from my kids so I can do this voiceover okay one more jogging in my life notice so I am coloring with some alcohol markers I like spectrum you are I bought the full set they are fun for me there I have them swatched out kind of on a spectrum to our chart and the reason that I like them is because of the price point one day friends one day I might own all the kopecks but I think that's a shot in the dark so I am one three you can watch me color I'm showing you what colors I'm using here and I really did have a lot of fun coloring in these images they are so cute and this little chick just the card the card that M I ended up making with him I just it looks like he's turning towards the Sun it could also look like he's feeling the rain you know how when your kids used to go play in the rain that was like in the summer oh my gosh there was nothing like a day of rain because we didn't have a pool we weren't that kind of family and so to go out and slosh around in the in the rain outside it was so much fun okay so I'm but while I'm coloring I did say you could skip ahead I think it was 5:12 if you want to skip the coloring but I'm gonna tell you a little bit about some things coming up in my life we are actually moving so we're gonna be headed towards the DC area in June and you're gonna see you mentioned that a few times because it's gonna be pertinent to some things I'm doing such as I'm gonna be downsizing a lot so someone mentioned one of my subscribers mentioned a craft tor just to kind of see how I have my space and I actually think it's got it's a brilliant idea to do that right now so thank you very much um but because I'm gonna be downsizing so much I think it'd be great to see how I go from what I have now which to me I think is a lot of space to a very minimal corner if you will so I could do the craft tour now and then in the future I could show you how I've downsized in things I've kept I plan on putting a lot in storage and I plan on selling a lot and then the rest of it like the essentials are gonna come with me stuff I make use all the time for card making is gonna be with me in my space so my husband is like a genius when it comes to crafting up stuff for space so I have no doubts that he's gonna make this wonderful even if we have to downsize he's gonna do a phenomenal job so if you would like me to do a craft room tour comment below and I'll see about getting that done yeah so that's what's going on upcoming also I'm probably in the last since January I've been hitting YouTube super hard I have a ton of videos on here since then even and I'm gonna have to scale back quite a bit on that process if I could do this all day long you guys I would and I would craft with you and I'd go live and we'd have a ball I just can't I have a full-time job so I have to scale back especially with the move and because I'm gonna be studying for a big test coming up in September so there's all that going on and so I need to make sure I'm prioritizing I have to do the things that I have to do so that I can make time for the things I want to do right so isn't that kind of life's struggle so we're always trying to balance out stuff we have to do and stuff we want to do and so yeah so I'm gonna be making that work and I also am very excited about all the newness that has coming our way the kids are excited I think they one of the ways I was able to sell it to them was well I went through all the other stuff that I thought they you excited about like there's like so many museums kids and they stared at me with that head deer-in-the-headlight look and then I was like okay that's not it um so there's gonna be a lot to do in the city you know lots to see we're gonna be three four hours from Grandma and family okay if they're starting to get a little bit more excited and then I said you guys it snows oh well then the heavens opened up they were just over the moon about that it snows and I just tell them be careful what you wish for I grew up in Pennsylvania so I know about the snow however they're gonna experience it a little bit better than I did I did not I had a wonderful childhood and we had everything you could possibly need but I do remember the five of us there's eight kids but at the time the five of us gathered around the kerosene heater in the winter as we came down in the morning before school they won't have to quite experience the cold in that way okay so enough rambling Here I am I'm done coloring up my three images here so much fun so I had this heart just sitting off to the side of my desk because I had cut it out for a previous card and I just took out my wilted violet and picked raspberry tools that already had the foam on them and I'm just using up some of that ink that's on the phone now I'm taking out both of those inks and I am gonna do make a background I loved this little pattern that came with the kit I thought this was so fun now if this is not perfect and if you want it to be perfect I suggest not following suit with me because it's just if you really look at it you could tell it's cut off but I'm going with it and so then I go back in and I do match up the purple best I can and I'm gonna make this pattern obviously pink and purple and I thought that was a lot of fun I tried it with just the pink I didn't like it I tried it with overlapping the pink and the purple I didn't like it and so this is the one way that I came up with that I thought yeah okay I can get down with this and the heart that I'm gonna place on top of it breaks up the pattern quite a bit so you don't see all of the little details that I messed up so here it says you make me hoppy think that's adorbs and then I took my little fluffy tail and I cut it in half the reason for so that it would lay a little flatter on the card instead of just popping up and so that helped 3m foam mounting tape on the back of my bunny and I'm just gonna place him down and that is pretty much it for the car to add the little the little thing oh I did add pink to his nose too I didn't show you that in the video and then this card is gonna be popped up on the base that came with the kit one of the pink colors that came with the kit and so there's a little close-up oh so cute it's the most realistic bunny that I have in my stash so cute alright taking some pattern paper from the kit and I am going to cut that up in half and then I am going to die-cut with a lawn fawn rectangle dye and when I did that I noticed that it didn't it wasn't perfect from side to side so then I took to my little Fiskars and I did I got it perfectly triangular and then I'm gonna take another piece of patterned paper that came with a kit this almost wooden type paper and that's gonna be cut out in the same size as the chequered and then is it platter checkered you go I think it's plaid I don't know then it says bloom where you're planted can I just share with you all that that is my absolute favorite quote bloom where you're planted because you are not always going to be in an area that you chose I deal with this at work with folks that I work with they don't have the job that they want they want a different job listen you are here for the interim enjoy it bloom where you're planted this is where you are so let's find the positive in it let's figure out how you can grow from it even if it's uncomfortable etc so I just adore that I now have a stamp that says bloom where you're planted yes win okay there there is the finished card I did add a lot of glossy accents to the boots to make them look like the plasticky rain boots and that was fun the next card then I'm gonna do here this is I believe this is the last card I can't even keep track I'm just rambling on I am going to use the little rain dots that came with the kit and I'm going to cover the panel on the side this and then a little punch making another appearance am i trying to get the most use out of my punches I think so then I realized wait a minute I don't want to mask it I want to actually stencil it so I put down the correct piece of the masking paper and I am then gonna mask off a little more so I don't get it all over I'm pulling out good old distress inks and I'm using I want to say squeezed lemonade and mustard seed I think those were the two I chose just to give it a little bit of gradient and then the Sun shall be revealed now I did have to take to a hero arts February 2017 card kit I believe and I had to get some of these clouds from it it's a solid cloud image and I used ice spruce distress oxide so that was the clouds that came out and now I'm gonna cut down my panel now I did if you notice I'm the bottom of where his puddles are I did add some more of those rain droplets to kind of look like the water was sloshing off and then I'm gonna add my sentiment which is you make rainy days brighter I believe that's the one I chose for this one and I wanted to use my mini Misti because perfect placement I went really far with this card already I did not want to screw this up and so then on the back of this I'm gonna play some yellow fun foam because my card panel the base is gonna be yellow this card base is from a previous Simon Says Stamp kit and I'm just gonna be using up what I have here and then I'm gonna place him down now for this card I did lay him flat but I put a lot of glossy accents on him loved how it turned out the water the boots the umbrella and then I used sparkle I'm gonna show you the sparkle pen here that came in the kit so you take the cap off remove the yellow thing twist it back on and then you're gonna squeeze the sparkle into the barrel so it comes down into the brush this is just like a spectrum new our sparkle pen just like a wink of Stella glitter pen it's the same concept I really like this one I think I like them all it does provide a very nice coat of glitter I think maybe a tiny bit more than the spectrum you are but yeah I mean it's par for the course I love the sparkle pens so this is no different and here's my finished part um I'm going to show you a close up here where you can really see that shine from the glossy accents oh and then the glimmer from the Hat so the glossy accents just really makes this card come alive okay so that's the three cards I'm going to show you the process for but I do have a bonus card here I had colored in this bouquet over at the craft galley shop you can pick that up it's super cheap I want to say it's been the $5 range for that bouquet and I water colored it and then I added it to piece of the pattern paper that came with this kit a sticker that says grow and then on the inside it's another sticker from the kit so that will do it for the cards thank you so much for stopping by to craft with me today I hope you had fun I will list everything I used below don't forget to hit subscribe and then also find me on Facebook and Instagram so that we can have a little bit more interactive chat between each other and then lastly before I go remember I told you there's gonna be a giveaway in almost every video so today's giveaway is gonna be super easy I asked you a question previously in the video just go ahead and comment below if a craft room tour is something you'd be interested in and I will pick a winner have a wonderful day bye bye",

Holcomb here with another episode of that's behind the module this is less than 13 finding equivalent ratios given the total quantities so this example says a group of six hikers are preparing for a one-week trip all of the group supplies will be carried by the hikers in backpacks the leader decides that each hiker will carry the bag carry backpack that is the same fraction of weight to all other hikers weights this means a heaviest Mike will carry the heaviest loads the lighters micro to carry the least potato below shows weights of each hikers and the weights of the backpack the first thing I'm going to do before I answer any of these questions is I'm going to convert this all into so I'm going to okay so here's my calculator so what I want to do is I find want to find out how many ounces this is I could just do it the long way but I'm just going to save time for the video 152 times 16 ounces per pound is 2432 and then I have to add this four ounces here plus four ounces is two thousand four hundred and thirty six ounces 2436 okay now I'm going to do the same for the rest so I go back to my calculator and 107 pounds times sixteen ounces there's 1712 and then I'm gonna add ten to that so it's one thousand seven hundred twenty two ounces it's back to my calculator 129 pounds times 16 ounces per pound gives me two thousand sixty four ounces plus the 15 ounces so it's two thousand seventy nine pounds and then finally sixty eight pounds four ounces is sixty eight times 16 plus four Trent 1092 ounces okay so there's our lightweight so he's 14 pounds times 16 ounces 224 Plus 8 it's 232 let me change colors so this is going to be two hundred and thirty-two ounces 10 pounds 160 ounces plus 4 I can do that one in my head 164 ounces eight pounds times 16 plus 12 is 140 pounds and 10 pounds 160 ounces 10 times 60 okay so I converted everything now the next thing I want to do is let's represent the hikers weight as X and it represent the backpackers weight that's why so the total weight is going to be the hikers weight plus y backpack so it's X plus y I'm gonna do this in ounces so if I do that it's 6 plus 2 is 8 3 plus 3 is 6 plus 4 is 2668 balanced this is the total weight okay and it says weight pounds we're gonna divert that after 4 plus 2 is 6 6 plus 2 is 8 1 plus 7 is 8 and then the one out in front I can't do any more totals because I don't know wise and I don't know the X is here so that's the next thing we need to find so I need to know so we have the equation K so I'm gonna take two hundred and thirty-two divided by okay so that's my Y - 32 divided by my X 24 36 I go down to my calculator and do 3 2 divided 2 4 3 6 a fraction is 221 okay so that's my k2 alright so if we have the equation y equals K X we were trying to find Y right here these are blank those are wise and I know it equals 2 over 21 times my X which is two zero seven nine so now I'm going to do that on my calculator is going to be 2 divided by twenty one times two zero seven and that is 198 all right so then I'm going to clear this and then I'm going to plug it in 1092 here 1092 okay so I'm plugging in this x over here y equals K times our X so it's going to be 2 divided by 21 times 292 it's 104 okay so now if I go up here and add these now 9 + 8 is 17 carry the 1 9 + 1 is 10 plus 7 is 17 carry the 1 1 plus 1 is 2 plus 0 is 2 and then the 2 4 + 2 sticks 0 plus 9 is 9 1 plus 0 is 1 and then that one out in front plus nothing in front is great ok so that done now we need to get rid of all this now we have to find X's in the equation we have y equals K X and we want X by itself we're gonna divide by K if we divide one side by K we divide the other these KS cancel and we get K equals y are x equals y over K so I know I don't I know why I know okay so I'm gonna take my why I change to that color 140 divided by / 22 over 21 which equals 140 times 21 / - okay well that's gonna reduce to 70 so it's 70 times 21 which is a hundred and 1470 okay so and then you want to check see if this makes sense 1470 is more than one thousand 92 and 144 so yes this person is heavier they're carrying more weight and then there's someone up here heavier 1700 and 164 is what they're carrying that's more so that makes sense a heavier person is carrying okay so now I've got to do one last calculation to finish this table so we're using this equation again so we're going to take Y 160 divided by K 2 over 21 which is equivalent to 160 times the reciprocal of our denominator and the two will cancel the 160 and make that 80 so I don't want 21 times 80 is 1680 and then we have 0 plus 0 is 0 7 plus 4 is 11 carry the 1 1 plus 1 is 2 plus 4 is 6 and then the 1 out front and then finally 0 plus 0 is 0 6 plus 8 is 14 carry the 1 that's 2 2 plus 6 is 18 and there we have the table now what we need to do is convert it to what the table says to do let me get this out of the way it says total weight pounds so now I need to take that 2668 these are Alice's two thousand six hundred sixty eight ounces divided by 12 equals two hundred and twenty two and one-third so what does that mean well it's 222 pounds and a third of a pound and there 16 ounces one third of 16 what goes into 16 three times how many ounces so five times three is fifteen and one third so twenty two hundred twenty two pounds and 5 and one-third we're going to add all of those up and change I will not take 4 3 6 + 2 3 q 6 6 8 by 16 666 oh i divided my 12 I'm sorry I knew there's a fraction so this is not correct 166 3/4 of a pound so 1966 at 3/4 166 pounds and 3/4 of a pound it's 16 times 3/4 Leflore Oh make that 4 4 times 3 is 12 okay but I got a fraction of an ounce okay 166 pounds 12 ounces example 2 when they business buys a fast food franchises buying the recipes at every restaurant we'll use the same thing for example all pizzeria specialty house restaurants have different owners they must so use the same recipes for their pizza sauce bread etc you're now working with your local pizzeria specialty house restaurant below are the amounts to be used for one be first preheat so okay so the key there is there is a quarter cup of sausage 1/3 cup of pepperoni 1/6 cup of bacon 1/8 cup of what's the total amount of toppings used on each pink lover's pizza well we have eggs here we have 6 here we got to get a common denominator so 24 is going to be our denominator that's gonna be common first thing I need to do is make 1/4 times 6 third 3 times 8 is 24 so 8 times 1 is 8 24th so if I have a denominator of 24 here 6 times 4 is 24 or 4 times 1 is 4 and then if I have 24 here I did 8 here 8 times 3 is 24 so it's gonna be 3 24th and then again that's gonna be another 3 24 so if I take 24 as my denominator 24 the numerators 8 and 6 is 14 I can 4 is 18 and 3 is 21 and 3 is 24 well that's 24 24 switch equals one whole cup okay that's first we had to know how many cups the meat must be mixed using the ratios ensure the customers do the same great tasting meal hours every pizzeria specialty house restaurant nationwide so if I went into a pizzeria specialty house restaurant in New York State the table below shows three different orders of bean flours pizzas total for one pizza given above filling every row and column of the table sufficient so we need to fill this all right so first thing I look at is sausage people and this one here order number one okay so we're going vertical order number one they ordered enough pieces for one cup of sausage well if we have a quart cup of sausage on one pizza I need four pizzas four times 1/4 is 1 I need 4 pizzas ok since I just said ok that is my kick caters for in other words we ordered four pizzas to get sausage so in that case we're gonna multiply all of these by 4 so 4 times 1/3 is 4/3 or 1 and 1/3 Peroni and bacon if I multiply that by 4x4 sixth and that reduces to 2/3 and then beef our camp was already done 1/2 so let's check that 4 times 1/8 is 1/2 4 eighths is 1/2 so obviously if ham and beef are equal and we're going to do it half there so total cups would be better add up to this because we're order four pizzas and one pizza has 1 cup 1 plus 1 and 1/3 is 2 and 1/3 plus 2/3 is 3 3 and a half and another half is definitely ok now let's do the same to the other two pizza orders so here is our known we know order to had one cup of bacon I'm going to erase this now we have to find our K and the easiest way to do that is just to ask yourself one cup of bacon well if I have one cup of bacon what do I have multiply 1 6 by to get 1 and it is 6 so now for order number 2 K equals 6 so this better come out to be 6 but I've done so if I multiply all of these by 6 because that is our constant that is our how many wheat pizzas we ordered six quarters is three one and a half three halves or one and one half pepperoni six times 1 over 3 is 6 over 3 6 divided by 3 is 2 okay ham six times 1/8 to 6/8 that reduces to 3/4 and sits Haman beef so one and a half plus two is three and a half plus one is four and a half five and 1/4 plus 3/4 okay so finally our last ordered last house pick any known that we have which is 3 and that was pepperoni so I'm gonna come up here now and erase this and now we're doing pepperoni which is right here and we have three today I don't want to write three they're clipped right down we're going to multiply it by if one 3/3 is 1 and we have three cops well that means I've got my pieces 9 times 1/3 is 3 so if I multiply that by 9 and that this party and then nine quarters 9 divided by 4 is 2 2 times 4 is 8 and 1/4 nine quarters bacon I am divided by 6 well 3 will go into 9 3 times 6 2 times 3 halves or 1 and 1/2 and then ham is gonna be the same as down here because it's supposed to be so 1 + 1 8 + 1 + 1 8 is 2 in 1/4 + 1 and 1/2 it's 3 and 3/4 + the quarters 4 5 6 you'll be okay so now here's this when you exercise the table below shows six different size pants ik that we use to make macaroni and cheese if the ingredients taste sitting how my thirst be awful be altered took out four different size two pants pants not big enough foods gonna overflow all over the stove so this X call this Y campaign sizing cups would be X plus y noodles plus cheese we've had first thing we need to do is look at something that we know both values which is great 2/4 so we have an X we have a y x and y is 3/4 and X that's 20 think of 3s 3 over 1 we multiply by the reciprocal so it's 3/4 times one-third threes cancel and I'm left with 1/4 and we need to check that 3 times 1/4 is 3/4 that's true so if I'm going this way I multiply by 1/4 and then down here if I'm going this way I got to multiply by the reciprocal 4 so 1/4 times 4 is 1 because 1 times 1/4 1/4 so when I'm going from left to right X 2 y and x 1/4 if I know why I have to go left 2 X I'm going to multiply it by the reciprocal of our K just all right so now I take 2/3 cups noodles and I multiply it by 1/4 so to find y I take 2/3 times 1/4 which equals about 2 becomes at that and it becomes 1 over 6 so this is 1 6 3 times 5 is 15 plus 1 is 16 thirds times like a 1/4 this 4 and that 16 cancel and become 4 and we have 4/3 times 1 which is 4 thirds so this is 1 and 1/3 or 4/3 okay now the ratio is 1/4 so this one we can kind of do in our head if we have 4 cups here and 1 here 4 times 1/4 is 1 and 4 plus 1 is 5 but here's where the trickiest part of this problem is if this is X all right so let me try to explain when you don't know X or Y but you have today this is X right we're gonna call that X if we don't know it let's just call it X and this is y but y equals K times X so y equals 1/4 of X so if I just get rid of this equation y equals and just to thinness then I have an X and I have a 1/4 X that totals five and five eighths well this is one X and this is 1/4 more of an X so 1 X plus 1/4 x equals 1 and 1 quarters so that's 1 and 1/4 Rex existed adding an X and a quarter of it okay 4 times 1 is 4 plus 1 is 5 so I'm going to turn that into a very improper fraction 1 4 5 4 X 5 4 X equals this 8 times 5 is 40 plus 5 is 45 over 8 and then get rid of this we change colors I need to multiply by 4 over 5 on both sides because 5 times 4 is 20 5 times 4 is 20 and that cancels and gives us X and then I'm going to do the same over here times 4 over 5 5 will go into 45 9 times 4 will go into 8 two times so our answer is nine halves which is four and a half all right I'm gonna come back here I'm gonna erase that because it's 1x and 1x is four and a half and I'm going to erase this so that's 1/4 of that X okay so I'm going to take this 9 halves 9 halves is here I'm gonna multiply it by quarter to get Y 19 times 1/4 times 2 which is 1 and 1 so 4 and a half or four and four eighths plus one and 1/8 is five and five eighths then I come up here and add these and we're done 3 plus 3/4 is 3 and 3/4 1 plus 1/4 is 1 and 1/4 2/3 plus 1/6 well this is 4 6 just 1 6 is 5/6 5 times 3 that's 5 and 1/3 plus another third that is 5 and 2/3 okay and we're done that is the exercise perfect okay this was quite a lengthy process obviously 26 minutes in this video so I'm gonna stop now over here", "5fYj8aHjBuk": "hi my name is Maria and I'm a mathematician and today I'm going to show you an easy way to remember how many pints are in a gallon so I'm going to draw a big G to represent a gallon and if you can remember this picture then you can always remember your conversions so I'm going to draw 4 Q's in this big G of mine my G stood 4 gallon and my Q's are going to stand four quarts so that means there's 4 quarts in every gallon now when every Q I want you to draw two peas and each P is going to stand for a pint so there's two pints in every court now your question was how many pints are in a gallon so what I have to do is count up how many peas I drew in this huge G and there's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 that means there are 8 pints in every one gallon and you can use this big G to find different conversions between quarts and gallons also right there's 4 Q's in 1 gallon so there's 4 quarts in 1 gallon and there's 2 pints in 1 Q so there's 2 peas and 1q means that there's 2 pints in 1 quart so if you can remember that big G you can remember that there are 8 pints in every one gallon", "k7Zryii5NIE": "this is a follow-up video on the live run so before I get started I went ahead and made some changes to this because I had the wire hanger go over the corners of this because the front plate like this broke off so I wasn't able to put a hanger through there but I did find a little tab on the back side that I could slide the hanger in front of it actually is removable but I need my players I don't really I don't think I have oh here we go but it comes out it's from the plate is removable so if this shorts out or anything I can change it easily just put some new plates on it all right so all right so I here I have just over a ground before you get started I always like to squish it through so it doesn't slide around when I'm pressing it so I'll just go ahead and before it's turned on it's not hot and the nice little talk like that might even just press these together [Applause] when I try and stick it these together and then I'm gonna turn this off after all right so what I have here is just some parchment paper make sure it's parchment paper and that wax paper all right so I got you squished together let me see what a good there we go nice and frosty all right so you want to make sure you got all the debris off of the parchment paper that'll be in your roster what I'm going to do is I'm going to put it on this side and then I'm going to probably squeeze it squish it about 2:1 once the two more times turn this on first I'll let it warm up and I will get back to you guys when it's warmed up all right guys I'm back and it's all heated up we're good to go so I just put that right there in the middle close to the edge and I want to put it all the way at the edge because I want to get you guys a shot of it through the side seeing all those good juices fall out so I wanted to do just realize I made a left-handed vise grip press all right so get it in there push it towards the back yeah let me see if I can focus into that all right you just keep pressing you hear some sizzling might that go on for a little bit you actually can see someone coming out right there it's bubbling all right and then release that was a good one and as you can see right there this works just as good as the real deal and I can probably squish this about once more looks like I got a lot of it so I'll go ahead and do that are you guys here I'm gonna do another close-up of the Rosen oops snapped this one's a little longer it's gonna sizzle and then you're gonna see some coming out on the edges squeeze a little bit more and then release there's really no timing for this I mean pretty much the school by ear line as you go if you haven't done this before all right so I'm gonna throw this in the freezer real quick and then I'll just try to get it all stuck together then I'll show you guys once it's a hardened alright I'm back again and I'll just show you this real quick a little close-up on this the Nugget that I pressed you can see some oil this is gonna be left behind you know can't really help that it's just a little bit though this is not completely done though you can actually probably press this one more time and after it's brown and decarboxylated you'll be able to you can just pretty much eat this like a chip grind it up put it in some coffee I mean look at a lake at least a little high depending on how much you ingest cannabis so I did go ahead and I threw this in the freezer for about 30 seconds and the dial on hot plates was about at a 10 to 15 so about half way you can see that this is a nice golden color this is right here is the first one and you can see how just [ __ ] gorgeous this is it is a bit warming a show it is still kind of gooey but I threw it in the freezer so I could hurt it a little bit when I scrape it this down here is the second round not bad at all for just over your grand all right so I am gonna scrape this and I will get back to you guys so in order to make this easier for you guys what you're gonna want to do is put a little bit of water and a baggie freeze it and then put the parchment paper on top of that baggie and start scraping it's going to make it a whole lot easier it's going to come up with ease thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed it and you any questions or comments comment down below", "ku91XAyyN6c": "so far we've only focused on the 1 ounce leaky drive slug in our first test we used a nun rifled shotgun and had very bizarre flight characteristics and this is less about the destination and more about the journey next we used a rifled choke tube to impart spin stabilization on the slug and we saw for the most part a noticeable improvement in just how the slug flew through the air but we also saw on one occasion the wadding getting shoved into the back of the slug and completely ruining everything [Music] we've seen what the one-ounce leaky drive slug will do and what it can't do now let's take a look at the 7/8 ounce version many people have commented saying that they've had much better results using the 7/8 ounce version of the leaky drives look for the most part they're very similar in design of course the 7/8 ounce one is a little bit lighter and a little more nose heavy now once again we're using off-the-shelf birdshot shells for the two yourselfers not quite ready to get into reloading yet we want to show it this is just another option for you although it's not a requirement having a mountain storm shell prepping tool comes in very handy for making these things and these things work great for making wax slugs too and I want to thank our W for supplying us with this cutter and also those seven eighths ounce slugs you can see how it leaves the Roll bead there to hold the wadding and everything in place it's just an awesome tool to work with now we want to address the issue of the slug being stuck or shoved into the back of the cavity and you can also see we have a lot of extra space there inside the shot cup we should be able to address both issues using something called nitro cards which is just a fancy term for five-eighths inch cardboard discs now you can buy the nitro cards in bulk and they're about maybe 2 cents each and it didn't make any sense because I had a 5/8 gasket punch and plenty of scrap cardboard and I should note that you need a shot cup in order to fill the space between the slug and the rifling in order for the rifling to work the the slug has to squeeze through there and that plastics a bow or shot Cup fills that space so it will spin we will be shooting these through the Mossberg 590 with the smoothbore but first we'll be shooting them through the Benelli Nova with the rifled choke tube and once again we'll be shooting these at 50 yards here's his grouping but let's look at the high-speed footage to see how he got there now if you were just looking at the grouping and try to make an evaluation that way you really aren't looking at the whole picture really this is the only slug of this set that actually oscillated all wild like that but the strange thing is that particular slug hit closest to the target so there's really a lot of factors going on here that can throw off your shot it could be the way our W cast the slugs it could be that wadding that is missing two petals that throw things off it could be the brand of shells that I selected or those homemade nitro cards that I made and we know that Roberts a really good shot but you know he's prone to being human too ain't like any humble person he's willing to admit that we see something very interesting in the shot watch closely we know that when an objects flying at a supersonic speed it has a low-pressure area behind the slug and we can see one of the nitro cards just kind of falling off right before it hits the target the round is constantly decelerating it gets to the point where it just can't hold under that nitro card anymore now it appears to me that in almost all these shots there is a nitro card stuck to the back of the slug and really I don't think that played a major factor in the grouping of these slugs but every little factor plays its own little role in how a slug flies through the air so you really want to achieve absolute consistency on how you load them before you even shoot them how did the 7/8 ounce slugs perform out of a smoothbore shotgun how good is the smoothbore performance the answer that is remarkably good despite not having any spin stabilization the slugs flew nice and straight for us it has become very obvious to us that the 7/8 ounce slug is a far better slug aerodynamically there's just something minutely hinky about the 1 ounce Li key Drive slugs but the 7/8 out slugs they did it right they got the balance right and they fly very well I hope this video was helpful to you thanks for watching", "5oDG2i6rwjU": "I'm not gonna do that but I don't have a problem with this we're obviously working with the shotgun today specifically in 12-gauge the Remington Slugger 1 ounce Magnum rifled slug 3 inch shells there's a close-up of that and a close-up of the rifled foster slug so I'm gonna use that in a smoothbore let's get another look at that it's got your rifling on there and guess what it's hollow it is not a solid through and through piece a lid so we might have some interesting things happen with that I was using the Mossberg 590 a1 special purpose that is a 20 inch barrel and obviously I would not have shot through my own vehicle but it would be interesting to see what it would do to a couple of car doors although I don't think this particular slug would pass through both sides and here's the reason why on those jugs that was from 20 feet just water jugs 1 gallon jugs it only penetrated the first three that is it here's what happened this broke apart in two pieces in fact the smallest of those was lying on the ground just in front of the target and the widest point diameter is over an inch and a half this has a muzzle velocity of over 1,700 feet per second let's try it in something else we have a block of the sim test media calibrated to match ballistic gel specs it is 20 inches in length weighs approximately 50 pounds we're going to tag this from 20 feet I have some water jug back up and trees if necessary I don't think either of those are going to be needed based on what we saw in the water this offers much tougher resistance anticipating some fragmentation as we had earlier and I think worst-case scenario is possibly a fragment exiting the side of the block I'm also going to put a drop cloth on the ground just in case this goes vertical and jumps off the table all right oh wow most impressive oh good grief good grief what a mess looks like it hit low very low I was aiming right for the center how about that all right let's take it apart see what we can find due to the weak conditions I had to bring this into the garage I've already found a section of the slug this was underneath the target platform that weighs approximately one quarter of an ounce so we are on our way there's another perspective of that this is the entry point this section fell off during transit down here to the garage which was about 60 70 yards this is the entry point so technically I was in the block just very very low and by the way that was delivering roughly two thousand eight hundred foot-pounds of muzzle energy given that weight and velocity so there's a close-up of the damaged path and this is the first five to six inches to give you a perspective this is what caused that or contributed to it there is the hall from that shot to give you some perspective and let me give you another one okay several minutes have passed I figured out what's happened here this is the point of entry and I shouldn't have to remind you this at the bottom of the block here is the path moving this direction and thank goodness it curved upward at about this point eight to eight and a half inches it exploded into multiple fragments and I had to cut some bacon slices to find those this is the segment that I found on the ground I think it impacted right here and dropped out here's the next segment this traveled nine and a half inches and the largest segment traveled twelve and a half inches imagine that the heavier the segment deeper the penetration maximum diameter is nearly one point four inches combined weight of the fragments is 0.97 nine ounces I might find some additional fragments during the melting process what more can you say about these things they are freaking awesome I know some folks use them for target practice but many might use it for hunting so you're definitely gonna have some massive trauma blood loss bone crushing raw energy in these things and you're certainly aware of that for home defense I'm not a big proponent of these I would much rather use a large buckshot unless of course you have bears and other large critters roaming your yard and within your house that's not a good thing so hopefully this was educational maybe even a little bit fun thanks for watching", "mMq_fS9roqg": "hi everyone its Mary welcome back to the channel so I am finishing up this hero arts February card kit with the next and last three cards in this kit and I'm gonna have a lot of fun disclaimer you can watch what I'm doing here I'm just tracing out a circle I mean a heart disclaimer there is some funky business going on with my video so the very last card I actually don't show you the whole thing which breaks my ticker because I really wanted to show you the details of that one however I'll talk about it and we will all recover from this I don't know what happened my phone has never done that before but you'll see it as we go through in fact I make you watch a piece of it just so you can feel a little bit of my pain as I was trying to edit this video alright card making so here I drew out a heart from a die and I'm going around with one of the little flowers in the kit and I'm using the hero arts ink that came in a kit but I also wanted to add a purple and then a light pink and so I'm doing that erasing the pencil mark and that is gonna be kind of the focal point kind of the focal point of this card I pulled out some hero arts ombre ink which is in grey and this stamped from I know I went outside the kit I'm sorry but I had to because I was challenged to use the little nest that came with the die the little wooden thingy okay so this is what I came up with so I cannot recall who challenged me and asked me to please find a reason for that but comment below alright so I'm cutting out the heart I cut out fussy cut my crosses that I did there and then I am going to start assembling this card already now I have to tell you about the ombre ink I love it just make sure you kind of shimmy back and forth when you use nut ink so that you could get a nice little blend because otherwise it's just a little stark but love those ombre inks I got them on super sale at Michaels a long time ago okay so I am put some fun foam sorry some 3m foam mounting tape and fun foam on the back of these objects here and I'm just trying to figure out my placement and how I want to do this I actually ended up popping two layers of fun 3m foam towel I can't speak today 3m foam tape and now I'm just gonna fix my little cross and the what seemingly was a nest that I used as a crown so this is a card for my Christian friends out there and for the season of Easter and I'm just gonna create this little look here with the crown and the cross and I thought that really I really like the way it turned out quite honestly um so let me know what you think okay I could not why I could not find a reason for that wooden thing on a card as a bird thing is because it's laying the wrong way so it's not like three-dimensional I don't know I'm I know other people came up with a great idea and I'm sure it's cute added to anything but anywho Happy Easter there it is I finished up that card added some confetti sequins and that will do it it's actually a pretty simple card to do I just kind of had to figure out how I wanted to glue things down use some multi medium matte for that wooden piece and I actually glued it and held something down oh there it is did you see that that's squirrely business oh there's more coming sorry folks buckle up okay so here I am doing a lot of inlay die-cutting so I am die-cutting the what is that thing called a branch and then I had to cut this out but this is the third pass of this bird I used two of the colors that came in the kit and I'm gonna die cut that out and that's gonna be inlaid I cut as well so I'm gonna die cut it here and then I'm gonna actually use the die inside the back of my background paper right so you'll start to see how this thing comes together there you go you see it okay so I have that ready to go I'm going to make some colored paper for my sentiment which is spread your wings and then I'm going to use my Prada punch back punches are making appearance so I got that little oval punch and then I'm just gonna start assembling my card I'm downsizing soon so my punches might have to go goodbye but what that really equates to I'll probably just pay money every month to keep them in storage because I think I can get rid all this stuff I just can't I can't Oh give me strength okay I am putting together my card here and you want to keep those little pieces as you die-cut as you see me popping those pieces in there because it's gonna really finish off that the card of what you're trying to do so I'm gonna get my card together and then very simply I pop up my spread your wings and then I'm gonna add some sequins but before I do that a little bit of spectrum new are just around the edges of the wings and around the belly and I'm also going to bring in my Sakura black jelly roll pen which I love this thing just for a little dot on the eye and finish off this card with some craft Galli sequins that I have I love these sequins and the colors just complimented so well so here's some close-ups of this card here I love the inlay die cutting effect I don't usually do that that was probably one of three times I've ever done that and so that was fun I really like doing that all right look coffee break what are you guys taking your coffee I like just almond creamer that's it just almond creamer I used to be like sugar cream french vanilla and now I'm just like little too sweet so okay here we go with my this this is where the worst of the videos is that's why I had to cut it I just I just had an emotional response so I said I can't anymore I'm gonna talk about this card and I'm not gonna be able to show you all right but I am gonna show you the inking because who listen squirrely film or not who doesn't love a little to stress oxide business so I had to show you that I mixed up these colors loved them so fun can't get enough of do that's great okay so I'm gonna get that I got both of these the idea here now I'm just gonna go to some stills because that's just what it has to happen so the idea here is I made one panel with all the sentiments that were lined up exactly as the other panel with the multiple colored sentiments you can pop out or cut out the one color sentiments like this and you can see them line up perfectly with the background that was the intent there I ended up only making this card for the video purposes but in the future you can do that with multiple things I loved all of these sentiments so they're all different but which one is gonna highlight my card that was the point behind why I did that is you can make a panel a bunch of panels of all these sentiments and then per whatever the occasion is you just go ahead to the other one pop it out with a punch or a die and call it a day and now you have a card already assembled right not too much thought anyway that was the card but if we look at some of the stills here just some other additional pieces I popped up the branch I used two branches I popped up one I used the hero arts gray ombre ink again and I cut out the bird with the dye as well and then what are some other fun things I did I used some gray background to that one and then I used some spectrum new art to kind of hit some of those highlights on the card other than that that was pretty simple to do as well a lot of fun that's it for these three actually six cards a set from hero arts February card kit thank you so much for joining me don't

right it's just a little different way just to add a little something to the front of the card and this is not bad to tie at all we might just do it just like that because i didn't want a whole lot of bulk you know the post office is really getting fussy um i do stamps.com and i got a message from them yesterday that postage will be going up from now until i think it's like the 24th or 27th i don't know of december good morning mary um and i was like you're just increasing postage for the holiday season is that allowed i don't know i guess it is but yeah so um i was like wow so we can't add too much bulk you know so that's why like i was doing just a little knot here and i kind of like that now that i've cut it back a little bit i did use some wink of stella on my i don't know if i'm picking up that glimmer right there we're going to emboss that in gold so let's go ahead and let me move this aside so i can use it as a reference and let's begin let's go ahead and get our envelope um decorated i'm using mossy meadow i re-inked my mossy meadow again last night but i don't know if i need a new ink pad and i'm using real red today so we'll see how it goes okay and in so right here is your holly right here this is a great little stamp set you know you could color this i use the stocking has some nice bows with it i think it's fun but i just wanted you to know that if you did tags you just didn't have to stay with tags oh that came out pretty okay so let's go ahead and stamp our holly here and now remember our postage is going up oh yours is too yes yes i i am just um amazed reaching almost a full dollar to mail 20 okay yeah yeah i don't i that really kind of shocked me that that was going to happen just for the holiday season i suppose where everybody now is again at home whoops i missed that just a little bit um i our our area is having an enormous breakout um two sheets of copy paper wow that's um that's not even a card um here's here's our envelope just cute with that little holly on it right uh but yeah so that was just kind of uh i don't know just for the holiday season okay now let's go ahead and bring in the entire um this would be like the little package if you were doing a class or something now if you were doing a class in person i would never cut all of this i would put pieces in there so that people could cut and interact but when you do one good morning lin um it's a card with a single layer i see yes uh-huh yeah wow that's hard because we like to have dimension isn't it so um but then if you were doing a class like online like i do i cut everything up for my um the people that purchased like my happy crafting card kit class everything comes cut up so it here is our little outside card this is simple six by three scored it three very simple regular whisper white um the little dsp here is two and three quarter by two and three quarter that will go on the end that one will go on the inside on the outside we have real red at two and three quarter by two and three quarter and then this one uh this dsp is two and a half by two and a half just everything's cut down by a quarter of an inch and it gives us a nice eighth of an inch border so that's how that will go together now our card base is um thick whisper white and then the inside i have some mossy meadow at five by three and three quarter the dsp from heartwarming hugs at four and three quarter by three and a half and then um this i cut down to four by three just an easy four by three i wanted more of my dsp to show instead of just going in at a quarter of an inch so let's go ahead and decorate the inside of our card with what we have here this way we can get all these pieces out of the way and then we'll talk about what goes on the outside okay so tis the season let me get my mat here tis the season i just can't believe it's the 20th of october how did that happen in real red right there and really on this card i'm letting a lot of the dsp do a lot of the work for me let's go ahead and add our holly i did that again that's just getting in a hurry lifting my stamp too quick right we're gonna i'm gonna drop this down a little bit because i need the space for the little dots the little berries in real red right here and right there beautiful okay now let's go ahead and add this to the inside of our card just to make it pretty we'll use a little tombow here let's see let's hope that i'm live that we don't have anything oh you're good um the card base is um thick whisper white the card base is thick whisper white at eleven by four and a quarter

carol hi carol good morning so i did this one a little bit larger because i wanted less of a white border on this one five and three-eighths by four and one-eighth and we're just going to tombow that down and let me use my reference here our thing today is making our little card for the outside oh thank you so much thank you guys i appreciate every one of you so sweet okay now we have a real red here and um this real red is five and a quarter by two and a half and our dsp is five by two and a quarter we're going to go ahead and place those two together not a difficult card to make but kind of just a little bit of fun on the front and you can do this kind of a setup for a card with a birthday card uh thinking of you card just change your dsp change your colors oh thank you carol i appreciate that yeah i'm like right at 6 000 subscribers i think i just lack um five or six subscribers to get right to 6 000. now i'm going to add this to the front of the card over to the left a little bit and i'm leaving um a border of my mossy meadow all the way around this so cute right there okay let's see i missed something whoop oh you're so sweet thank you thank you so right here on the front i know right by patricia i love these colors mossy meadow and real red are very very christmassy okay so now let's go ahead and work on our little card on the front and i swear i have this crooked the more i like just look at it but we might be committed right oh are we committed just gonna pull it over just a little bit i think we're good now okay now on our card on the front i want to use my stamparatus because i have a very large stamp here to work with and again this little piece is six inches by three inches scored at three so i'm just going to stick it in here and instead of using a block on this because i am notorious of getting things crooked i think it is my total signature just to get things off and i've learned here recently i have the tools not to do it it's the stamparatus and so right here and i'm just going to pick that up let me make sure i'm good here let's see we're still good yep and just going to use a little real red on this let me make sure yeah just a little real red oh that's perfect absolutely perfect i love that just takes a second right and then you don't have to re-cut paper and ta-da i'll move this out of the way clean that in a minute now i want what i want to do is um decorate the inside of my card right there just adding a little dsp and this is um two and three quarter by two and three quarter i will list all the measurements and there will be a product list on this channel sometime today um so when you if you come back to this channel you will click something that says show more everything is down there every link you need everything everything is down there for you so here's the front and i'm going to take my real red and again this one is two and three quarter by two and three quarter we're just making a little decoration on the outside of our cute little card here today we have to emboss we're going to color just really cute and now this piece is two and a half by two and a half card in a card yes thank you diane thank you i appreciate it okay so this goes here now now we've got to um let's go ahead and do our little circle we'll leave this aside okay and this thing still looks crooked to me on the front of the card i cannot even but i am committed to it right yep okay i just have to leave it leave it leave it don't pull it off okay okay now we're going to take i just took this little circle die right here this is a stitch circle and thank you patty and um then now we're going to use a little versamark and we're going to do a little embossing i love to emboss in the um in the holiday season i'm using our gold embossing powder here and my little embossing buddy now we don't sell these anymore so you can get them online or michael's or joann's or um hobby lobby or i had someone tell me that you could put baby powder in an old sock tie it together with a rubber band you've got the same effect what this does is take the ink the oils from your finger off of the paper so that when you do emboss see i tap it a little bit to get a little powder out um so that when you do emboss it you get a nice solid image with the versamark and then when you put the powder on it doesn't flake all over the place okay so let's use our little boot here and we'll put that in our versamark and we'll put this right here on the front of our card or our circle that's going to go on the front of our card right nice okay now you can't see it because versamark is sticky i don't know if you can there's the image i just got it in the light for you okay it's kind of clear well it is clear and now i'm going to use the gold powder get my little spoon here and then i'm going to just put it over top of my image that i just did cute and that looks just brown right wait till you see i just i loved him boss i used to be afraid of it because i seriously was not good at it and i would have stuff all over the place but um the more that i've done it i've perfected it a little bit and you know i kind of understand it better let's go ahead and heat this up oh wow um okay so and then we put the heat on here and the magic will occur and oh my goodness i just love it i don't know if you guys can see it turning oh yeah you can see it right there it's magic yay [Applause] so um i my daughter is texting me as i'm working here she was going to send my grandson back to school because everything was good but um hi mary and oh that came out so cute um but then all of a sudden the numbers went crazy this just happened this past week and um so then she found out that they put the desks together in one of his classrooms and she was like no no so she rescinded she um sent an email to the principal on sunday actually and she was like oh no no no no no no so um it was it's okay for mason to still stay home i'm gonna take this in real red look at how cute that bow is with the little swirls right and we're just going to decorate on either side of our stocking and seriously guys if you just wanted to leave that gold it's cute it is just cute i'm going to take a little bow right here into my um mossy meadow let's see if this one comes out darker oh yes oh that's good i really i i was afraid i was gonna have to order another ink pad but i re-inked it i got a little messy i have to you know you can see it i got a little messy with the re-inking but i re-inked it and it came out nice honest you could leave it like that it's so cute but i want to color it a little bit and then i want to add some wink of stella so any while i color um i'll talk to you we have light cherry cobbler we have a dark daffodil delight and dark old olive it doesn't matter what color you make the stocking just whatever colors make you happy okay and now i'm just gonna color with my blends and um so yeah so my daughter made the decision she was like i i you know she was uh really torn about it this weekend and i told i just said to her i said what does your gut tell you is going on and she was like i just have this feeling that i should not do this and i said then don't you know so luckily no because now just today they're talking about going back to all virtual for everybody the numbers have skyrocketed here within just a few days which is crazy and i'm gonna do this toe down here and so yeah like today i have to go to walmart pick up some medication i will be in the car and call them and they can bring it out not getting out of the car again it's crazy so just a crazy time right but here's the greatest thing right i could stay in here with you guys and craft and just have a great time and it's just simple and easy and fun and i'm just really happy oh that is just coming out so pretty so pretty okay now if you could see right here there's a little stitching here and i'm going to color just that little line in there along with the toe that is going to be green i could have extended my yellow color or my red color out but i decided to do the green and hey guys when you color anything goes anything goes absolutely anything however you want it i like to color but i like simple coloring okay and that's what i like about the blends because i don't have to think about anything it just does it for me it's just easier for me i love to craft but i don't like things to get difficult for me or difficult to maneuver you know or things like that so these work out really well for me you could also use a pencil on this and you can watercolor or you could just pencil it or you could even just use markers okay there we go it's just simple coloring not hard at all but i want to use some wink of stella now because i have a large area i am using wink of stella instead of my um my jelly roll pen i have like a jelly roll um that's uh this is glitter and if i need it in a in a specific area i love that but we sell the wink of stella and i'm just gonna go ahead and go back over all of this and the wink of stella will reactivate this ink and make it just a little bit darker so it looks really cute now see i have a little bit of a red tip on that i'm just going to wipe it off on some scrap paper goes right away and i'm going to come into the yellow here or i should say dark daffodil delight no yellow on that we're good now into the old olive and just adding a little bit of sparkle to what we have here is fun fun fun like i said it reactivates that ink so it swirls it around a little bit more and it's just so cute so cute if ever you're in doubt and think to myself well what else can i do here wink of stella there we go that's it now let's hold let me hold this up let me see if i can't get that yeah right there see how glittery it is oh so sweet okay so now we're going to put this on here and i'm going to pop it up with dimensionals the government wants to what i miss that yeah let me see government wants to keep keep schools open yes i agree lynn letting their guard down absolutely pete you know okay so you know i mean i hate it i really do i hate this for everybody but guys you got to be smart okay this weekend in this town they had the autorama it's outside but there was a lot of people my daughter was like oh my gosh there's gonna be community spread well she was right okay so you just can't right now you just i'm i hate to say it you just can't you know every i i have my daughter has a friend his father got sick that's so cute and um he

don't touch anything there's too many people down there you know i mean we find ourselves saying that okay so here we have oh that is so cute with that wake up stella isn't that adorable okay now we're gonna attach this ribbon and what i did last night was i just took this and i went oh okay let's see how much do i need about here let's do just a little bit more right because now i'm really

red ribbon the sheer red just gorgeous ribbon okay um okay so now what i'm going to do and i'm out of seal i wish i wasn't because i love the seal um i had i i have to admit i had a love-hate relationship with this stuff at first see i'm out it's coming today actually um but now that i've i i've used it a lot and um i kind of understand how to use it um i really like it now okay now i'm just gonna put a little bit here now what this does is it this allows it to hold our ribbon so i'm going to put this in the front and i'm just going to wrap it around the back and i'm going to like make sure that i have what i need out here about even okay let's move this aside and i'm just holding it and i'm just pushing it into that that's actually snail up who said what here let's see there are the dmv is appointment only yes yes ma'am yes i believe that the country we are having oh do you see what i did i put this on and my ribbon goes underneath it that's because i'm talking about coronavirus right ah let me concentrate on what i'm doing instead of yip yapping huh okay we're gonna mar the paper just a little bit but we're still gonna be okay because we're going to be able to put that back on okay so back up don't attach that first bring this over and we're going to do the same thing here just with a little snail or whatever line adhesive that you have now we're going to place this here and it's going to hold it see it holds it front and back just like that so sorry guys place that first now we can put our stocking and nobody will see that i ripped it up okay right there so we're good now we have this secure and you can do this with any card let's say that you do like a fancy fold card and it won't stay shut you can always run some ribbon like that and even on the back of the card and help yourself to close it now with this we're going to use some dimensionals on the back here i am going to put one on that ribbon to secure it even more yes so that is what is going on here in this town and um we have a very small town it's like i say all the time we live in hooterville i'm talking again i hope i don't make another mistake thank you jeanette i know right so don't attach your medallion there until you attach your ribbon behind it and then let's put this right here oh this is so cute oh that is just that's fun right look you could do a cute little birthday card you could use the hippos on this and put some hippos on the outside of it and and just you know use the use the the design but just change your paper yeah okay you're still having trouble oh thank you carol yeah bling bling says she's still having trouble using the um seal i was too i have to admit i was too um but now i really it's such a great adhesive i don't know if i'm doing a bow here or if we're doing a knot i'm not sure yet um it does it there's a learning curve for sure with it oh that bow might just be too thick and wild looking right yes don't like that at all okay so it's just one tie just like that i re i like it like that and i'm just going to cut these shorter now i never throw these away because if you've seen me stuff these under things and like break them in half and stuff them under it makes it look like a whole ribbon so i don't throw these away so here is our card with our nice little closure i'm just going to tuck that under there just so that it'll hold it a little bit just like that get under there cute i went to the post office oh what happened here yeah cause that's new jersey and had to use bling they sell an extra ounce yes it covers the heavier card oh okay nice 15 cents actually a forever 15 it covers the heavier card and those that pop up oh okay lynn thank you i'll have to see with my um stamps.com of what they're gonna you know because i do get a little discount using them so i'm just tucking that under there if it will stay maybe not that's okay though here we go after a lot of mistakes yes yes i i had to get a little savvy with that seal i really really did i will be live tomorrow on facebook at 10 a.m we will put a card together here's our cards for today i hope you'll try my little card on top of a card here and my little closure with just one little tie because i think it really it came out the best like that just like that that oh thank you so much i appreciate that um it's just too cute just too cute of a card we've used a bunch of dsp we did a little coloring a little embossing not hard to make at all and just a very very fun front of the card and we used some more dsp we have to use our dsp guys have to absolutely have to thank you gene very cute very thank you i hope you enjoy this and i hope you'll try this on any card that you make doesn't matter if it's a christmas card this is a great way um to give it just a little bit of a wow factor when somebody opens it up right just a little something different on top of the card and a very easy easy easy closure yeah i didn't know if that would come out you know as well as it did but it did and i really like it great thank you thank you bling bling i appreciate every one of you on here hopefully i'll see you tomorrow on my live facebook at 10 a.m we will i have no idea what we're going to be working with but we're going to have fun i do know that and we will do some happy crafting oh yes yes please yes make this make this card anything that i ever do guys you never even have to ask me go right ahead and case it if you like it please case it uh that is the greatest compliment i could ever have if you all um copy my cards and or my designs whatever you just take it and run with it have fun do happy crafting all the time hope to see you tomorrow have a wonderful day stay safe and do some happy crafting today", "7D-yvfYZVt8": "now i'm going to take my cord and i'm going to draw the design that i want on it and then head outside with that saber bur so that i can strip some skin off so i just use the radius of my wrist to mark out the area of the usable area that would be visible on the core it doesn't need to be perfect if it's too perfect it won't look handy okay i think because of all the darkness this is going to be the side that i want to use for the leaves and then the other side can be something floral okay so we're gonna end up with a leaf here here and here here here so this can be my leaf areas comes down like that all right i'm not terribly good at freehanding leaves and these are a little bit too big so i don't think i can use these or templates i'm just going to have to kind of draw these leaves in them to look like oak leaves so first i'll put burn the leaves then i'll burn the edges of that and then i'll do the stippling outside which actually that means i don't have to use the new bar i can just use the little turbine head one okay now got to find a design for this side so give me just okay so now i am going to use one of the diamond burgers just a little sharpie and i gosh you can barely see my design on here but i'm going to go ahead and score it all in and i think rather than wood burning because sometimes you can't be as precise with wood burning i think i'm going to score it with this and then maybe use some dark dye and dye the lines that i want dyed and maybe that will be a little bit quicker and easier let's see i can always go back and wood burn it [Music] okay that was quick so what i learned with that was well this was great for making those bubbles making little holes it doesn't pull and it doesn't draw really well so back to the wood burner which is fine because i like the piece of quiet of that anyway along the lines i decided that a board on one side that was completely committed to representing the fall time of year was a little bit locked in and i decided on the other side it should represent a different holiday and so on the other side we have a christmas shooting star and the creche so while you're watching this you must understand that i decided that i needed to put a creche on the backside of the gourd so that it would actually serve two functions at once this is what you're seeing i am using a compass to set everything up and i am drawing with the lines and i would like a shooting star and yeah i wanted the score to serve two things at once so that's how i made the star absolutely on both sides i drew one side fold it in half and cut it so that's why it's symmetrical now we're gonna do the messy stuff and you're probably going to see some cats go by so what i'm going to be doing is scraping off stuff here they're just kiki hi kiki hello hello i'm going to make some noise okay yeah we're going to get the noise gonna make some noise it's gonna be noisy dusty i'm gonna make noise [Music] do so all right so this is shaping up to be maybe one of my favorite pieces ever what i just did was i took a very very small engraver bit and i just went around into the tiny tiny little areas where i couldn't get with the larger bit and i did all of the work with the larger bit outside and that was that was this one the saber tooth burr and this is kind of like a cone shape or a flame shape and it did such a great job i almost didn't have to go back and do anything at all and the way i worked it to make it a little bit more random was i kind of went in figure eight shapes so that it looks like it's still a little bit too much right there but i'm just kind of looking at it making sure it looks it looks like there's a little bit too much there too i'm just making sure things look that they're at the same depth that they're back the same amount and looks like looking a little bit more there as well and then what i'll do is i'll go back in anywhere that i've knit just a little tiny bit i'll go back with the wood burner and just touch it up so that you can't even see it this is turning out to be one of my favorite gourds ever so this is fall on one side and on the other side i'm going to cut it open here and this is just going to be a creche and the star is to hide the little bit of the um oil the oil lamp that'll be in here the star will just hide the oil lamp that will be in here and this will all be cut out this will be gold and this will be cut out as well and it'll just be a sweet little creche for the holiday season so i'm thinking this really is gonna be one of my favorite ports ever i'm just loving this look bye", "7uyhAC6iH5E": "[Music] hi everyone and welcome to my kitchen my name is rosana and look what we have here today we are making conchas which is a mexican sweet bread these are perfect they're delicious soft airy and you're going to fall in love head over heels over this recipe i already love them so much that i keep one close to my heart let's get started we are going to start by proofing the yeast start with half a cup of whole milk at a temperature that ranges between 105 to 110 degrees fahrenheit if the temperature is too cold the yeast will not activate and if it's too hot you can kill it it's such a simple step that makes for a great end result then sprinkle seven grams of active dry yeast over the milk and add a pinch of sugar which feeds the yeast the yeast does have an expiration date so make sure it's not expired if expired the bread will not rise then whisk in all the ingredients until well incorporated now set it aside and letterproof it will take approximately five minutes during this time it will start to bubble and foam it looks great now in a mixing bowl add in three large room temperature eggs and the proof yeast with the petal attachment mix on medium low speed just until well incorporated using a petal attachment will help the ingredients blend easier and speeds up the process the hook attachment will also do the job but it takes longer the mix looks well blended now add half a cup of sugar and a quarter teaspoon of kosher salt after they are well mixed in add in three and a half cups of all-purpose flour in small additions while the mixer is still going make sure the mixer is at a medium-low speed the entire time from beginning to the end it is also a plus because it will prevent the flour from going everywhere wait until the flower is fully incorporated then add the next amount and continue the process until it becomes thick when you reach the thick consistency it is time to switch to the hook attachment continue adding the flour it needs to be entirely incorporated once all of the flour is in knead for about two minutes until the dough comes together and no longer sticks to the side of the bowl go ahead and prep half a cup of unsalted softened butter by cutting it into medium sized cubes the dough came together beautifully now add the softened butter one cube at a time keep kneading and as the butter incorporates itself into the dough you will notice it will soften and slightly come apart let it knead until the dough comes back together which will take about 5 minutes the dough came back together but it still sticks to my fingers and needs more flour and kneading but i will finish it by hand this allows me to really feel the dough and know when i've reached the desired outcome but first butter the sides and bottom of a large bowl with unsalted softened butter set it aside until we need it every time i've made this recipe it takes an additional quarter cup of all-purpose flour to get me to the perfect end result take the flour in small amount and dust the working area transfer the dough over the flour and start kneading as you need feel the dough and if it still sticks to your hands does some more flour and keep kneading repeat these steps as needed but be careful the dough should not feel dry or too hard it will feel smooth moist soft and it will not stick to your hands mexican sweet bread reflects the passion and dedication panaderos or bakers have towards their craft i still remember walking by the baker's house on my way back from school right before sunset i never met the baker but the smell that filled the entire road stayed embedded in my memories when you get to the stage you will love the feel of it you may even break a smile feeling proud of your hard work being a success make sure you knead well if you've added all of the flour and you're attempting to add more i suggest you continue kneading sometimes that's all you need to do adding too much flour can also mess with the texture turning the bread dry dense and hard this dough looks awesome and it feels incredible round it into a ball and place it inside the buttered bowl turn it in the bowl to coat it well this will keep it from drying out then cover with a clean kitchen towel we are going to let it proof until doubled in size with the oven off place the bowl inside and turn on the oven lights this will create a warm environment for the proofing process the time it takes will depend on the temperature of the place it is in mine took two hours meanwhile let's make the streusel topping in a mixing bowl and with a paddle attachment start by creaming half a cup of vegetable shortening and half a cup of sugar until light and fluffy this will take about 5 minutes on medium high speed when creamed add in one and a half teaspoons of vanilla extract or vanilla paste and one cup of all-purpose flour and resume mixing i personally love paste because the seeds add a beautiful touch and the flavor is amazing i will leave the link to the paste i'm using in the description area together with my favorite vanilla extract feel free to check it out start the mixer on low speed to prevent it from creating a mess once mixed in you can slightly increase the speed to medium low and continue mixing until it is no longer crumbly but forms a uniform paste at this point i'm going to remove half of the paste and reserve it for later i will be turning the second amount of paste into chocolate flavor by adding one tablespoon of chocolate powder and mix it in until fully incorporated we are topping the conchas with vanilla in chocolate streusel take the vanilla paste and divide it into six balls i roll the dough and pat it into an even thickness then score a line in the middle in each half into three sections then cut them and roll into balls and slightly flatten them do the same with the chocolate paste and set aside until we need them the dough has proofed and it is spongy turn over a lightly floured surface or if you have a silpat even better that way we don't use any more flour divide the dough into three ounce pieces and yes i'm using a scale i typically get 11 or 12 conchas from this recipe now let's roll slightly cup your hand and place the pieces of proof dough under the palm and surrounded by your fingers the tip of the fingers will come in contact with the surface you are working on roll it under the palm of your hand as you add a slight pressure to form a smooth ball you can do one at a time or if you become skilled speed it up by rolling two at a time now rub softened unsalted butter between your hands and coat the surface of each sphere evenly this will ensure the streusel sticks once laid on top it is time to shave koncha is the spanish translation for seashell this fantastic and popular sweet bread gets its name from the beautiful and creative design of a seashell on its surface take one of the circles of paste and press to flatten them while preserving its round shape fly in until it covers the surface of the ball and some of its sides firmly press to make sure the topping sticks and begin flattening the dough like so by the way if you're not using a sill pad the dough could stick to the surface you're working on lightly dust the area with flour before molding to prevent that from happening mold as needed to preserve the round shape and make sure the dough is not overexposed both the streusel and dough should spread evenly and uniformly once you achieve a thick flattened circle place on a sheet pen lined with parchment paper and make sure you leave enough room around them so they can prove one more time until they are doubled in size you could also mold the concha on the actual lion sheet pan just like this but i prefer the previous way because i have more room to work with them if you're feeling creative you could also take some of the vanilla and chocolate paste roll each one join them i sometimes twist divide in half and then flatten then just follow the same steps we did with the previous ones then move on to the chocolate ones these chocolate ones are so fragrant your kitchen will smell like a bakery as the aroma flourishes and fills every room in the house to decorate them with the traditional koncha or seashell pattern you can slice lines through the streusel only the dough needs to remain intact as you make the lines get inspired and slightly curve them to get a more realistic shell shape you can also purchase a traditional concha shape stamp which is so much fun to use and makes for a more consistent concha lightly flour it so it doesn't stick to the topping and line it with the edge of the flattened dough and then stamp making sure you press through the topping only it doesn't take much force release and there you have it repeat until all the crunches have received their seashell shape once done place them back in the oven leave the lights on and let them rise until doubled in size remember we are not baking just yet so make sure the oven is off the time for the conchas to proof will depend on the temperature of the space they are in mine took two hours as they proof the streusel will slightly crack and that's fine it's actually part of the design i removed them from the oven about 15 minutes before the two hour mark or before i knew they would reach the size needed so that i can preheat the oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit that way when the bread is ready to be baked the oven will also be ready with the temperature set for allow them to bake for anywhere between 15 to 20 minutes or until fully baked and the bottom of the conchas have a nice golden brown color also rotate the pan midway so the bread bakes evenly once baked allow them to cool down and avoid touching the streusel because it will be extremely hot and you could get a very painful burn it's hot sugar the time has come where i get to showcase the inside they have a sugary crumble topping and a soft inside that will inspire you to make them at home they are truly perfect you can kiss dry conchas goodbye and forever be forgotten this recipe will take your sweet concha bread to the next level early in the morning assorted freshly baked bread was sent out for delivery across the town in large baskets with a hat-like shape specially made to hold and easily carry the bread to stores and or your house i cherish the memories and a well-made concha as well these are ready all right i'm so eager to taste them already make sure to accompany this with hot chocolate milk or champurado which i do have a recipe for so make sure to check that out all right i don't know which one to pick do you want one yeah sure you want chocolate or vanilla whatever okay here you go oh yeah one do i want i think i'm gonna have chocolate are you ready he already bit into it i'm sorry um wow they're so good aren't they yeah um the texture i mean so many memories come back to me i'm sorry these are so crumbly but they're so good now they are crumbly but that's just the streusel not the inside the inside is so soft i mean it is perfect i really hope you guys try this at home i worked really hard on this recipe because i really wanted you to experience what a concha should taste and feel like well we reached the end do not forget to subscribe like this video and click the notification bell also

piece from this cord to test the side color and make sure it was going to be a color that i liked and i feel like there's just something still lacking here and then my inspiration piece is over there and some other inspiration pieces there and i'm just kind of looking at this one what am i missing what's missing from this side on this side this is just some very simple creche i might do some holes here like stars i might not right now it just looks a little bit plain it doesn't look like a lot of work has been done to it i might go back and recess right here so that the star looks like it is closer to us and out more i just haven't quite decided what i want to do with this but i achieved my goal which was to use a board that had been started years ago and never finished and making it to something different than i've ever done and i've done gracious before but this one's this one's kind of different i might do some spots of gold in the background for some stars and uh this one's just looking a little bit plain like it needs a a cut out on top of here or it needs something and haven't quite figured out what maybe i will take this and cut out a larger star and put it on top so it has some 3d look maybe that's what i'll do next i just don't know can't figure it out it's missing something but i am pleased to have learned a new technique and tried out some different tools i got to use a new bit and a new saber bit so learned that this can save me a lot of time well since i talked to you last i think i have made some decisions the first is okay this is the basic i'm gonna have to turn your mouth so i can show you this um so this is the basic but i think i'm going to put this on here just because that will hide the oil lamp a little bit better i have to make sure it doesn't stick up enough for it to be seen from the other side but i think that will just give it more of a 3d look like i already have on this side and i happen to already have the perfect size base which i can't decide if it should be brown or gold or actually maybe black maybe the base should just be black i'm not sure hm decisions decisions this is the side i don't know black or yeah not gold i think black okay so here is the final i have to back up a little bit okay so this is an oil lamp and i have ordered the insert and it's going to be coming within a couple weeks but this is pretty much the final i feel like the gold is a little bland here on the sleepy side and maybe i need something else what do you think i think i need something else there i did the base in black and then i'll turn it around and show you got a bit of a surprise on the other side okay and the other side is a creche and this is where you would just put a little manger scene something like that for the holidays and that way you're not using up all this shelf space for our accord that is only for one season only for holidays or only for the fall but also for the christmas season as well and i've seen people use croatia's all other holidays and just put different scenes in them with easter scenes with rabbits and things and all different so that's how it turned out i'm pretty i'm pretty pleased with this side this looks pretty good i really like this gold is a little bit bland but i think i don't know just have to set it here in the studio on my desk and stare at it for a couple days and think about it so confession time i did sit around and look at that gourd and look at that gourd and i finally decided what it really really needed was a little bit of a rim at the top which i made with quick wood and painted black and that just finished it off instead of having a raw hole up at the top it just needed that final touch and now it's got the oil lamp in it and it is now perfect so thanks for watching i hope you found the uh hope you found the tutorial educational and helpful and give you some good ideas and i'll leave a link below to the products and the tools that i mentioned that i used in this especially the two birds that are making my life so much easier now so thanks for watching subscribe so you get the next one and i'll see you later bye [Music] [Music] so [Music]

problem a recipe for cookies requires 2/3 of a cup of butter Rama wants to make 3/4 of the recipe how many cups of butter should Romney use to make the cookies so a couple of things stand out a recipe requires 2/3 of a cup of butter she doesn't want to make the whole recipe though she only wants to make a part of the recipe she wants to make 3/4 or 3/4 of the recipe so we need 3/4 of the 2/3 3/4 of 2/3 which is the same thing as 3/4 times 2/3 that word of is typically a pretty good clue for multiplying we know when we multiply fractions we multiply straight across numerators and straight across the nominators giving us a fraction of six twelfths which to me certainly looks like could be simplified 612 both numbers can be divided by 6 which gives me a simplified fraction of 1/2 in order to make 3/4 of the recipe Rama will need 1/2 a cup of butter which is answer choice a in our next problem a pharmacist put four point five three six ounces of vitamin pills into bottles she put 0.04 to pounce of vitamin pills into each bottle how many bottles did the pharmacists use for these vitamin pills so we see a few things one the pharmacist had four point five three six ounces of pills and she put them in two bottles in fact she put 0.042 of an ounce or forty mm of an ounce into each bottle so what was she doing with the four point five three six ounces she was dividing it she was dividing it into bottles four point five three six divided by zero point zero four to four point five three six was all of the pills zero point zero four two went into each bottle when we divide decimals you should remember that we need to move the decimal in our divisor all the way to the end we can have no decimal divisor we need a whole number so when I move that decimal I moved it three places so I need to do the same thing to my dividend the number inside the house the decimal needs to move three places so now 42 doesn't fit into four but it does fit into 45 one time bring down the three forty two does not fit into thirty three so that's a zero bring down the six forty two fits into three hundred and thirty six eight times in fact that fits exactly eight times so that we know the number of bottles needed was d 108 in this a team of workers took 167 point 3 hours to complete a task a smaller team of workers will complete the same task but it will take them one point two five times as long as it took the first team based on this information which statement is true well so the first thing we know is that the first team took a hundred and sixty seven point three hours and that the smaller team was going to do the same task but it was going to take them one point to five times as long this suggests that we're going to need to multiply the original amount of hours times 1.25 so right away we know that the answer can't be a because a was suggesting adding and the same is true with B so pays out and so is B both C and D show multiplying but they show different products so let's do the multiplication and see what we come up with five times three is fifteen 36:33 a placeholder two times three six fourteen thirteen three two placeholders three seven six and one five 1902 I have one number to the right of the decimal here to here for a total of three so I need one two three numbers to the right of my decimal I get two hundred and nine 0.125 which matches answer d the task will take the smaller team of workers two hundred and nine point one to five hours to complete because 160 7.3 x 1.25 equals 209 point one two five and that's true in this problem Toby has three fourths of a candy bar he shared one-third of this with his sister how much of a candy bar did Toby share with his sister so let's think about this he doesn't have the whole candy bar he's only got three fourths of it all right some of it had already been eaten he agrees to share one-third of this with his sister so it looks like maybe this piece here he's going to give to her this is much less than the entire candy bar and certainly less than the three-fourths that he had so how do we find out the size of this piece of the candy bar well here's how we do it he had three fourths he's sharing one-third of this remember that word of again one-third of this times one-third when we multiply fractions we multiply straight across numerators straight across denominators and in this case we can simplify to get a fraction of 1/4 which is answer choice C well take a look at this candy bar again as well it looks like our answer makes sense if this is the entire candy bar and I broke it into fourths doesn't it look like the piece that he shared with her is one of those fourths I like our answer see Michael's car averages 17 point three miles per gallon of gasoline how many miles can Michael drive if he fills his tank 10.5 gallons of gasoline enter your answer in the grid below please be sure to pay close attention to place value and to shade in the bubbles all right so here's what we see he averages 17 point 3 miles per gallon he's going to put ten point five gallons of gas in his tank so seventeen point three miles for each gallon times the 10.5 gallons of gas in his tank we'll do this multiplication and when we do we'll find that Michael is able to travel 181 point 65 miles on ten and a half or ten point five gallons of gas in our last problem the Malone family built a rectangular swimming pool in their backyard here's this one pool the floor of the pool has an area of 103 and 1/8 square feet if the width of the pool is 8 and 1/4 then what is the length of the pool well we know that length times width or base times height gives us area so we just need to work backwards we're doing the inverse so instead of multiplying length and width we're going to divide the area by the width to get the length so we can divide 103 and 1/8 divided by 8 and 1/4 so there's a few things for us to consider here in order to divide fractions we need to have fractions and not mixed numbers so we could make the choice to turn these mixed numbers into improper fractions using the check my method check multiply add so 103 times 8 is 824 add the 1 so we get 825 / 8 / 2 check my method multiply add 8 times 4 is 32 plus 1 is 33 over 4 now you should remember when we divide fractions we elect instead to multiply by reciprocal so in other words we get 825 / 8 multiplied by the reciprocal of 33 over 4 which is 4 over 33 825 eighths times 4:30 thirds 825 8 times 4:30 thirds let's clear the board here 825 eighths times 4:30 thirds so a couple things for us to do here we can cross simplify diagonally I can make the 4 a 1 4 divided by 4 is 1 8 divided by 4 is 2 now I can multiply straight across 825 2 times 33 66 825 divided by 66 small zero that's five exactly three hundred and thirty twelve point five twelve point five or 12 and 5/10 the 5/10 would simplify to 12 and 1/2 which is answer choice B now that's if we decided to go the route of fractions we kept our mixed numbers I'm sorry we renamed out mixed numbers into improper fractions and then we multiplied using the reciprocal and then simplified and found 12 and 1/2 to be our answer now we could also have gone a slightly different route we could have said I don't really enjoy dealing with fractions and I would rather deal with decimals so 103 and 1/8 divided by 8 and 1/4 could also been written as 103 point one two five if I remember 1/8 is 125 thousandths as a decimal divided by 8 and 1/4 which is 8 point two five one four or 1/4 is written is 0.25 so I have 103 point 1/2 5/8 point 25 I have 103 point 1/2 5/8 point 2 5 now remember gotta me got to move the decimal all the way to the end in our divisor so in this case I moved it twice so I need to do the same thing to our dividend 825 doesn't go into one nor ten nor 103 but it does fit into thousand 31 one time bring down the two 825 into two thousand sixty two would go twice bring down the five 825 into four thousand one hundred and twenty-five goes exactly five times and look we get the same exact answer we got earlier twelve point five or twelve and five tenths which simplifies to 12 in one half the same correct answer of be your choice whether you prefer to rename mixed numbers into improper fractions and then multiply reciprocals and simplify or if you can remember to convert fractions to decimals and then do the division using the decimals", "WM80KgBSmxw": "so for this recipe that I'm making I need chipotle like ground chipotle pepper and I sought it fresh and easy and I thought you know what it's probably gonna be cheaper at bombs ya know it was eight dollars more red bonds because it was like the gourmet one not the fresh and easy one not to go back to pressure movie you get more chipotle peppers all things I do for friends anyway hope you're having a great know how to feel about this but I'm going for any good mean good question luckily I got good read happy so I'm out the look of us feel bad and the cheese that I just bought is cheaper here as well I'm losing today not good all right tell me go lines on the outside my favorite section favorite section of fresh and easy amazing if you've never had a Heinz baked bean with right here just Heinz baked beans in tomato sauce they are the best steak game kilogram I know that might be biased but honestly crime I'm crushing your frenemies grocery store and tribe my friend said surgery and I am making her mac and cheese for she has for mac and cheese so this is actually just simple this is like you can buy the store bought one which is fine there's actually a package of it around me on my butt on this is just an easy quick homemade homemade like recipe and literally it takes two seconds and it's way better than the box and you'll like it way better so right now what I'm doing is an extra just making a list all the route which is like a thickening agent for the cheese sauce and I'm gonna add milk this is butter and flour right now I'm gonna have milk the cheese some garlic powder some chipotle powder and yeah make a little cheese sauce so good mac and cheese is so easy to make it home and it's way better than the store-bought and i never thought that i would say that but i just have it so okay so that is milk butter and flour so it's like your basic like face of the sauce and then we're going to add cheese garlic powder and some chipotle powder and pick it up with them and and reception constantly searches don't want your milk to earn but this is a cooking with mr. Blythe show but it's super easy so I'll keep showing up but anyway basic in the soft so easy rubbish bin goat cheese off two guys so easy butter flour milk patience and cheese so I need need to make cheese sauce on your own way better than the store now just look away from a water to boil cook my penne get in the baking dish and then bake it so let the waiting game now ok cheese sauce done pasta is almost done we're going to drain the pasta for that then we are going to return it to this pot add the cheese sauce and then put it in this baking dish sprinkle it a little bit more cheese sprinkles a little bit more full length apart and put me out in for half huh new or done oh and my pastas done so I gotta go pasta cooked cheese sauce about TV be added I gotta hurry girl Ted fillmore this for you but negatory ok all you good mess with cheese sauce going from here to here looks and smells delicious alright so now i'm just going to transfer it to this pan over here I get that is it Wow as I said it sprinkle a little bit more cheese trickle a little bit more than chipotle seasoning pop in the oven for half an hour 350 good you", "wxBvAljrjFw": "hey guys Mike here with Stone Koch countertops dot-com check out this table surface that we just finished our final coat on we're gonna show you in this video everything we did from raw lumber all the way to our final coat we took many different species of wood we didn't even stain them this is all natural we're gonna show you everything that we did step by step how to adhere these together how to create this amazing table surface check us out and visit us anytime at Stone Koch countertops dot-com enjoy the video [Music] [Music] [Music] hey guys Mike here with Stone Koch countertops calm today we're gonna take all these different scraps of wood and we're gonna make an amazing table there's a bunch of different species just purple woods and jacobian walnut we got maple we've got all kinds of great great species that we're gonna laminate together and make a really cool project we're gonna show you how to take our epoxy and cover the surface we're gonna show you how to reinforce this so you don't get cupping and and movement on this table for the long haul stay tuned all the tips and tricks are right now first thing what we're gonna do is rip this down into two and a quarter strips our overall table is going to be 2 inches thick when we're done so we're gonna give ourselves two and a quarter so because we know when we bar clamp this together we're gonna have some imperfection but that's where our slab jig comes into play we're gonna show you how to level the sink to perfection it's gonna be very flat and very true so first thing I'm gonna do is set up the table saw and I'm gonna rip this down to 2 and 1/4 inches let's get started okay what we're doing is we're working with some wood that is what they call s 3 S which is sanded 3 sides and some of these are just sanded 2 sides and so you have two edges that are just rough sawn from the the actual mill and so we're gonna put a nice straight edge on one side of these so that we can then measure two and a quarter and cut our pieces accordingly and not have it be wavy down one end so we're just gonna take a nice straight piece of plywood that's already ripped and we're gonna shoot this with our 23 gauge pin nail gun the reason we use 23 gauge nails is because we could snap those off without evidence that you pin nailed it or screwed it or something like that they come out really easy but they hold just perfectly for a cut like this so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to start at this end I'll start my board I'm gonna get a measurement on that right here so we know that's about seven inches we'll come down here we'll get this at about seven inches and then we'll see and make sure when we rip this we just rip enough off to make a nice straight cut okay let's check that now and we're going to make sure that no part of that cut will be really see it bows out which is fine so our short points are at the end anyways so I'm gonna take off I'm gonna cut it at instead of seven we'll go six and seven eight that'll cut a nice sliver off of this but it'll make a really good straight edge for us so we're just popping this off now I got pin nails that are protruding and all I got to do is snap these off and on real hard wood trying to pull them out with pliers sometimes it'll leave them proud and they'll be sticking up and they're like needles so you just got to be real careful but if I do this those are nice and flush got one more it will pop that off perfect now I have a really good straight edge on one side of this that we can use and cut as our guide I'm gonna finish doing this stack of lumber we'll move on to the next step [Music] okay we got all the board's cut nice and straight so we put a straight edge on those boards that were just roughs on we're gonna finish cutting those all two and a quarter wide let's do that right now [Music] okay we got everything ripped too up two and a quarter now what we're gonna do is we're gonna cut them to length roughly because when we get this all laminated together it's not gonna be perfect you'll have pieces that protrude further than the others will take and will rip that as one piece but right now we're just gonna get it close so we're not wasting a bunch of epoxy when we laminate this together so I just got my simple t-square we're gonna set that up here we'll go to our shortest points which are right here and I'm just gonna give myself a mark so we can cut this on the chop saw now what's nice about our cut off pieces you can always save your cut off and use them on small projects and art projects and different ideas that you have you can even make a table out of scraps so we're gonna go ahead and cut all these down and we'll start our next step after that [Music] what we're gonna do right now is we're going to plastic the surface off because when we epoxy our and laminate this table together we don't want it laminate into our table so the plastic will act as a barrier between the table and the wood that we're laminating [Music] so what we've done is we've really separated color so that we didn't have any one color taking over a section we try to spread out the color I love what Mother Nature has done with these different species of wood and how you bring it all together and the beauty found in an unstained finish is is just crazy this is going to be such a fun table to laminate together we took the time to do this now as opposed to doing it after we've started the epoxy process because then it's going to be a fluid easy system we're gonna get it right put together without any worries so we got this set up we're gonna go ahead and get some bar clamps ready we'll get our epoxy mixed up and laminate it together we'll be right back alright guys we've got this all set up we added a couple more blonde boards we really liked the contrast what do you think of the contrast match it looks great I like how the orange really pops it's not too much it's just it's amazing on what Mother Nature can create here was not out of stain and all the different colors it's really amazing I agree I I I never was a big fan of purple but this purple heartwood it's got me sold and I can't wait to see what it looks like with the epoxy on there so what we're gonna do now is we're actually gonna take these boards we're gonna brush our regular stone coat countertop epoxy on each of these pieces we're gonna mock it up we'll squeeze it together with our bar clamps we'll get everything pretty square on the ends we're gonna come and cut those ends after it's all dry anyways but we're gonna pound down this and we'll get it all nice and tight get it all clamped up and that's why we have plastic you know you can't put bar clamps underneath and and rotate them but because we have a really flat table and pretty big feet on our bar clamps we're just gonna do them all from the top that way we don't get epoxy that drips on our bar clamp that we have to pop off later so we're gonna go ahead and get all this epoxy it up and clamp together and we'll let it sit let's get started you ready bud alright here we go [Music] okay we've got some Part A and Part B of a regular stone coat countertop epoxy mixed up we're just gonna use our shop brush and we're gonna go through here we're gonna brush one side we'll put it together you can do both sides if you want but one side is gonna laminate really well this is like the best glue on earth and you'll find that out if you ever try to pull something apart that's been a poxy together alright so what we're gonna do is just brush this out get a nice even coat on these boards and we'll love we'll do each board down the line here and it will be a great great Asian yeah get another batch mixed up and we'll start on that end Mitch and we'll just keep going right down the line here oh yeah no biggie [Music] we're now going to use our bar clamps and we're gonna start squeezing this together we're not going to crank it too tight until we take our board and our hammer and we'll start tapping these down to hold some of the crown down a little bit and then we'll we'll clamp it super tight and let it sit overnight let's do it [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay guys what we're doing now is we're putting these blocks in to hold our boards down you don't want any cupping going on because of our bark plants so these are holding everything down nice and tight we've taken some masking tape and we put it on the bottom side of the 2x4 because if we didn't this is gonna glue to our wood when we take these off the the masking tapes gonna glue to the wood but the planner will plan that right off for us but we won't get tear out ripping the wood apart because the epoxy would bond those really really well all right we're gonna go ahead and put this right here on the end Mitch I'll start and then you could we'll just get it loose we'll both clamp it together right now this is raised a little bit off my deck and when we do this it's gonna make it super tight all right you ready to go let's do it boy the epoxy now gives you a great idea of what this thing can look like when we're all said and done man what do you think what's funny is you still you know we had saw marks and all this wood and everything and and and it doesn't even it's not even close to wood it's gonna look like but it's still awesome yeah I'm all the way down nice and tight to the deck and we got this semi straight here you know we we got all the board's pretty close so we don't have a bunch of waste when we cut this apart but get everything nice and tight yeah that's nice and tight good yeah I'm not getting any movement out of those we have a little bit of lipids here and there but the the router jig is gonna take care of all that so we're gonna let this dry we'll come back after this is all dry and we're gonna start planing it we'll see in a little bit okay guys we've let this set up overnight we're going to start deep prepping it right now take all of our clamps off and we're gonna pop this up remove the plastic we'll husband's tape that has stuck to the underside and things like that but then we'll get this prep to start leveling with our slab jig let's do this [Music] okay guys we got all the clamps off and all the plastic off of our slab here what you have to remember when you're using plastic use three mil plastic or thicker don't use thin painters plastic because it's gonna tear it you really try to pull it off because it's gonna have some adhesion but a three melt gives you something to pull on and it won't tear apart and leave little strips for you that's a good tip what we're gonna do now is we're going to set up our slab jig to the thickness of our actual slab I'm gonna show you the distance right now of our jig versus our table so what you see here is we have a very little distance between our table and the actual jig and my router bit is about 3/4 of an inch thick and so we're gonna need to raise this table up now I can adjust my router down no problem but our hole jig needs to come up so that it will give us some room so I'm going to use 2 by 4 runners right along this edge and that's going to give us the opportunity to lift our jig if you have a really big jumbo slab you can build that up whatever thickness you need as long as it's the same on each side so if you wanted to do two 2x4 skis you get a really thick piece of wood you are gonna go ahead and plane down that's what you do if you need more table space rip those down to two by twos whatever you need to do just to just to lift this up on our wheels only take up about one inch on each side so that you don't need very wide strips to lift this up but because we got plenty of room on our ends we're just going to use regular two by fours to lift this up to the height we need let's do that right now [Music] [Music] okay guys so now we have inch and a half lifted here on our runner so our jig is actually going to ride up another inch and a half so we have a lot of distance here between our slab and our router now I got a 3 inch planing surface planing router bit whenever you hook this up you want to make sure it's really tight you don't want any vibration on this bit you're using a big router bit so just be careful so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna loosen my base let's actually get this through I'll loosen that base don't ever do this while the routers plugged in and now I'm just gonna make sure my bit will hit and it sure will so I'm gonna now find the low point on my slab so that we can set our router bit to that particular point so what I'm doing is I'm just making sure that my bit when I rotate this down it will come down and hit the top of my table without extending my router too far and that works really good now I'm gonna pull it up off that surface and I'm gonna use a tape measure to find the low point of my slab is I'm gonna just get a measurement here some one in fifteen sixteenths there I'm one in fifteen sixteen right there I'm two inches let's just go down my slab and see how thick we are there's two inches there's there's one in fifteen sixteenths there's two it's pretty even which it should be we ripped everything down but on a wood slab you're gonna have more coverage and things like that okay now that we have our slab jig lifted up an inch and a half off of our deck we're gonna set our planting bed and we know that we're pretty even across this so I'm gonna go ahead and just get get an eyeball here and I want to be about an eighth of an inch up so I can adjust this where my router is about an eighth of an inch off the deck and we'll test that out and make sure we can plane everything down I may I may have to get up go a little lower but I can always go a little lower if I want to alright let's set this up don't ever set that while the routers plugged in always be safe we're gonna put our mask on our ears have eye protection let's go for this right now another thing you're gonna want to check is make sure that your stuff is gonna stop your router bit from hitting your jig and it sure will right there we're set at a good spot we're ready to go [Music] okay here what we're doing is we're taking three quarter by three quarter-inch steel bars we've cleaned those with acetone we've gotten them all ground down with our 50 grit metal sanding disc so that we get great adhesion we're rotting out pockets so that we can insert these steel bars and have them flush under our table that's really important so that you don't feel them when you rub your hands and knees underneath your table these steel bars what they're gonna do is they're gonna reinforce this table so that it doesn't cuff or warp we're also using our semen crack fill to put these into the table or semen crack fill is very very strong and it dries in about three hours in the sandable in about three hours it's a great product to be able to embed things as well as fill cracks and crevices in your project you're gonna see that be used a little later on in this project you can also use a bondo spreader to spread our semen crack fill to fill in these joints when using our semen crack fill to embed these steel bars pour a little bit of material in the router tout joint put the bar in and then simply add a little bit more material and use a bundle spreader to make it flush you can come back and check your work you have about 15 minutes of working time to work with this okay after the semen crack fill has all dried now we're ready to sand off the excess and remove all the marks from our router jig we're gonna use a 50 grit metal sanding disc we have a link to this on our site as well this disc will get rid of these grooves very quickly and removes a lot of material with ease if you use a normal sanding disc it's gonna take a much longer time and a lot more effort this is a great tip and trick to really expedite this process after the 50 grit metal sandy dis deficit continues we will progress to normal wood sanding discs but right now let's remove all of these grooves so we have a nice flat surface at this time we're going to use our t-square and give ourselves a nice straight line so we can cut the end so we have a really flush surface we like to do two passes but we don't run that blade all the way through at one point so we get a great time after cutting our end grain we're gonna use our 50 grit metal sanding disc to clean up that cut I can't let me do right here so because there's a little more epoxy because these are bigger it's a little harder I'm gonna break this apart okay so you can see that epoxy holds stronger than that piece of wood is holding this is walnut right here and that walnut split not at the joint where the epoxy is has split on the wood that is awesome if you run the strategy process you can see it is extremely extremely how's that look perfect so there's no okay the next step that we're doing here is we're making a mixture of our semen crack fill we're doing a one-to-one ratio and we mix it for about two minutes after we've mixed it we add our thickener the reason we're adding thickeners so that the semen crack fill doesn't go all the way through these cracks and crevices and thickens it up and makes a great paste we add a little bit of our color here we're doing our metallic bronze but because these cracks are so thin it doesn't jump out at you like a metallic color it looks like a very natural deposit in this table we're gonna overfill these cracks and then we're gonna come back after it's dried and sand everything flush and this really sets us up for our next step when we do our seal coat so that we don't have our seal coat dripping and and going through these tiny little voids so we've gone through our table and we look for any little pit or crack and we're just over filling any of that now we are making a mess on our surface and that's okay we're gonna come back and sand off all this excess right after this dries we like to use a bondo spreader after we've applied our semen crack fill to make a nice flush joint I need to point out also we have not done our finished sanding we've only done our 50 grit sanding disk up to this point some of our favorite benefits to using semen crack bill is that at zero vo C and it's fast drying it's not gonna hold your project timeline up because usually in about three hours it'll be tag free and ready to sand here we're gonna use that fifty grit sanding disk and we used one on this entire project and it didn't clog up we're ready to router the edges of our project now we like to use a 1/4 inch router bit on the top and a 1/8 inch router bit on the bottom this is a really clean look to your project we also like to use a sanding disc by hand on those edges as opposed to using a power sander on the edges so that we don't deform that nice clean routered edge after we've routed our edges we're ready to use our random orbital sander and remove all of those initial scratch marks caused by our angle grinder and that metal sanding disk here we're gonna start with a 60 grit sanding disc and we're gonna move through 60 grit 100 grit 150 grit and we'll stop at 220 grit on our random orbital sander we really take our time with that first pad or 60 grit pad to remove all of those swirl scratch marks you need to do this so that when you wet out your surface you don't see swirl marks coming through that epoxy the epoxy is amazing and it will really bring the grain to life but if you've left scratch marks from your low grit and you're standing it's gonna show through so take your time and have fun this is honestly one of the most relaxing parts of the whole project and it's also one of my favorite now we're ready to bring this project to life we're gonna do our first seal code we're gonna mix up one ounce per square foot and we're gonna pour it right on this wood surface now what is a porous surface so if we were to start with a big thick flood coat all the air trying to escape this wood would cause stubborn bubbles in our project that we don't want so we're gonna start with a very thin coat and we're gonna squeegee it on using a normal shower squeegee when we pick our squeegee we don't like one with metal parts on it so that we don't risk scratching our finish sanded surface so we're simply gonna spread this epoxy out and we're gonna work the epoxy towards the edges when we get the epoxy towards the edges we're simply going to roll it over that edge using a controlled motion with our squeegee and we'll come back with our gloved hand and we'll rub it in the surface as you can see here we're just rolling a little bit epoxy over that surface and then we'll come back and rub it in it's a really fun part of this project because you get to see what this wood really looks like when you apply our stone coat counter top epoxy it honestly brings it to life all right what we've done is we've done our first seal coat and now we're ready for our second seal coat one thing I want to keep in mind is when you do your seal coats you're not going for perfection you would need a flood coat to have everything level out perfect we're just getting the surface wet and you're gonna see that some wood is more porous and soaks in the epoxy than other parts of the wood so some of the alder has really soaked this in and so what we're gonna do is sand this with 220 grit we'll sand the edges we'll sand the round overs by hand don't use your power sander on the round overs because we don't want to mess up that perfect shape we'll simply go through those first sanded by hand and then all the flat spots of the surfaces we'll do with our power sander we'll get everything sanded we'll wipe the dust there's no need to use a solvent we'll wipe the dust and we're ready for our second seal coat again this is done with the same stone co count ur top epoxy that you're gonna use for your flood coat it's the same product it's just applied much thinner when you do the seal coats here we go [Music] a quick tip for you is on your first seal coat you're gonna have bubbles and it's really gonna show you where you need to concentrate where you need to fill again you're not gonna be perfect and that's okay don't worry each seal coat it gets better and better it's like unraveling a Christmas present so here I can see some divots and dips and nibs and nubs and those kind of things so I sand it a lot of that off but don't try to sand this perfect leave those imperfections all we're doing is roughing the surface up you don't have to get it perfectly flat each and every time we're gonna build these coats up also on our edges if you do have drips that's what you want to get rid of each time you don't want to have bumpy edges so use that power sander on the flat part of your edges and make those nice and smooth and then when we proceed to the second seal coat it's going to come out even better than the first let's get started [Music] all right we're ready to pour our second seal code let's get started [Music] now I'm not gonna push anything over my edges just yet I'm gonna get what we call the field of the project we're gonna get the majority of the inside square footage and we'll just push it up towards the edges and then when we're when we're ready to do the edges will have plenty we won't have wasted a bunch over the edge man this really brings this to life okay now I'm ready to push it over my edges let's go ahead and do that [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I look at that edge so I'm just using those drips over the edge to coat my edges you're gonna you don't need a lot of material on those edges so you just push a little over get it to start dripping and then come smooth it on out keep that plastic clean and then any epoxy that sits over that edge on the plastic there's your reserve right there if you need a little bit more so the final step of this seal coat is what we call mowing the lawn we're gonna start at one end and we're just going to do long strokes so that everything gets somewhat even and then we'll go through and rub those edges one last time because we won't be pushing some epoxy over the edge in in different amounts and so we don't want wavy edges let's do that right now [Music] now you don't need very much torching on the seal coats you don't want to try to remove the bubbles with the torch because you'll burn your wood it still doesn't have a lot of protection from the epoxy so we're just gonna do a quick torching but a quick tip when you use a torch is I'm gonna have some dust in this torch so I don't want to start blowing this right on my surface so I'm gonna start off the surface let it start make sure there's nothing in that torch head and now we're ready to do a quick torching [Music] [Applause] using stone coke countertop epoxy on your projects is really easy to do as long as you have the right steps follow the steps that we're showing here in this video and you're gonna get amazing results we've been through the trial and error we used to put on too thick of coats and we would get problems with air air would almost make it white and foggy in areas when it was really porous would so be sure to follow these steps do your seal coats until you're completely sealed once you're sealed that flood coat is gonna be magic for you all right well we're gonna let this dry we're gonna put our radiant heater in here really heat this room up because we're gonna do a seal coat at the end of the day we'll get to seal coats done in one day we'll see in a little bit okay guys we're ready for our third seal coat we did our second seal coat about eight hours ago and it's dry pretty well but there's still a little tacked to that it's still very very fresh and because it hasn't been 24 hours we can apply our third seal coat without sanding if you're new at this I always recommend waiting 24 hours sanding between coats wiping the dust and applying another coat but because it's still tacky and we did this today we can apply the third coat without sanding we're going to apply this in the same manner with a squeegee we'll let it dry and we'll be able to sand and do our flood coat tomorrow let's get our third coat on right now [Music] alright folks we've got our third sealcoat completed we did that the same way that we did the first two we're gonna let this dry overnight we'll come back and we'll sand and we'll apply our flood coat we'll see in a little while hey we got our third and final seal coat all wrapped up here and inevitably on a wood slab project especially around knots and cracks or little stubborn areas you'll get these little tiny bubbles that just never seem to fill up they they want to blow air out cause a little bubble and that's the epoxy doesn't sink down into that area so I'm going to show you how to save yourself from these problem areas where you don't have to keep doing seal coat after seal coat we use a burnin stick we actually have pieces of our our burnin stick we use these all the time they look like a giant coloring cran and you can get them from a company called Mohawk we have a link on our website to the actual burnin sticks that we get you can get whatever color you'd like and then this will fill these little tiny problem areas we're gonna sand these bubbles down flush fill them with our burnin stick and then sand that flush after we do that we'll sand this entire top with 220 grit sandpaper and then we're ready for our final flood coat let's get started so I got a bubble and some bubbles right here we're just gonna fix these one at a time so we don't lose them out we won't sand the whole thing we'll just sand these problem areas and fill them and then move on to the next spot [Music] so now here you can see these little pin dots that are voids in our surface and this is what we're looking to fill this is exactly what would cause you problems when you keep trying to seal code so we're going to use our burnin stick to fill those right now when using the burnin stick just make sure you get it nice and hot at the tip and then you're going to rub it in like a coloring cran another thing I like to do is sometimes heat that up while it's on the surface and then just rub it one more final time so it really pushes in that little divot what we're gonna do is we're gonna use a razor blade to get most of this burnin stick off the surface and then we'll sand one final time with 220 to make everything almost invisible keep in mind when you're looking for bubbles you can sand those off and you'll know real quick was it a high point or was it a bubble if it's a bubble you'll remove the top and it'll become a slight divot that's what you're looking for for the burn and stick so just use your sander as your friend take a few minutes before you do your final flood coat to really look for any problem areas and then you won't need to do another flood coat we never want to waste epoxy folks so that's why this step really helps in mitigating those problems okay now it's time to remove our excess burnin stick after we filled our little divots and what I like to do is heat it up and then take our straightedge razor blade and just remove the excess it's really that easy now we're ready to sand the whole top after we have done this and take it down to 220 grit okay now I'm ready to sand because I've got all my little pin dots filled and addressed and I'm ready to get this to 220 grit on the entire piece we do 220 grit because that's a good mechanical bond you don't need to go higher than that it's gonna hide all of our sanding scratches when we do our flood coat what I'm gonna do is use 220 grit sanding disc right here on the edge by hand and then I'll do the flat part of the edges and the surface with my random orbital sander let's get started [Music] [Music] okay what we're gonna do now is we're gonna move our tabletop into another room that's a little less dusty the reason we do that is so that we don't have dusts falling into the surface of our brand-new tabletop with our flood coat when you're doing your seal coats doesn't really matter these are never gonna lay out perfect in fact you don't have enough epoxy at one ounce per square foot to level out so you're gonna get an imperfect surface and that's what we have here now we're gonna do our flood coat in our finish room and that's going to come out just awesome if you don't have a finish room you can use a PVC pipe structure that you can make and then drape some three mil plastic over that structure so that it doesn't touch your table but it will stop anything from falling into it it also traps the heat really well all right I'm gonna move this and we'll get started on our final flood coat we'll see in a moment okay guys we're getting ready to flood coat our project we're just gonna mix up enough material to have three ounces per square foot on this flood coat we'll start with Part B we'll do equal parts one-to-one ratio by volume not by weight we're gonna do Part B and then we'll add Part A let's go ahead and mix this up if you haven't seen our video on how to mix go check that out it's really simple just follow these few easy steps let's get started [Music] make sure your your surface has been wiped down with a paper towel you don't need to use a solvent or a tack cloth just wipe any of the excess dust right off that surface and you'll get a great flood coat it's also important to keep in mind when you mix your material put your material in front of a space heater for a little while so the the epoxy will flow out really nice out of the containers it's nice to have have it warm so that when you do trowel it out it's not really really thick like honey it'll trowel really easy just like we're about to show you you don't want to leave your material in the bucket for a long period of time if you do that it's going to heat up and generate heat and you'll lose working time you want to get it out on the surface and then you have all the time you need to get this bubble free here we go [Music] you [Music] now because I scrape the bucket into this mass of epoxy I'll use my 1/8 inch square notch trowel to go ahead and move that around so that it all mixes really really well now because we heated this up it's moving really easy on our surface so let's try all this out we're not gonna push it over the edges quite yet we're gonna get the field all coated and then we'll come through and address all those edges very very carefully so we don't waste any epoxy the nice thing is is if you take a little bit of extra time here you don't need to mix up more epoxy than what you need because you won't be wasting it over the edges oh my goodness look at this this is just this is just beautiful I love this project I'm very proud of it so I'm simply gonna go through here use my square knot straw to spread this out the square knot straw gets everything gauged at the right thickness so that it'll level out for me really well another thing to keep in mind with the square notch trowel is it's designed at this angle so at this angle that's about the angle that you want it when you're troweling out so that's what you're looking for you don't want to turn your trowel really really tight like this you want to keep it up at that same angle and you'll get the right amount of material on the surface all I'm doing now is just using this little bead of epoxy to start rolling it over my edge come through here and get some excess just gonna start addressing this back edge before I move on to the front edge there I'm just rolling enough over the edge so that I could come back and brush that in and get it nice and even [Applause] [Music] [Music] so now we're just gonna chop out any of those trial lines and this also helps to mix the material one final time when mixing like this you don't get any sticky spots in your surface because you basically mixed it three times you mixed it in the bucket you mixed it again using that trowel and finally using this brush when we do this it looks like you're just really dimpling and ruining that surface but we're so new in the working time it's gonna level out great for us and I'm just doing a random pattern chopping this out helping it mix removing any trowel marks and then I'll start addressing my edges and start torching when you torque you want to torch at least three times and really look at those bubbles when you look at those bubbles you'll see that you get the majority of them out with the first torching but you don't want to focus that flame on the same place for a long period of time come back in about five minutes torch it again and then finally torch it a third time [Music] okay I got a bunch of bubbles in the surface from mixing and chopping and troweling now we're gonna start our torching process we just used propane with a good burns o matic torch head you want to get one that has holes in the neck so that when you turn it upside down the flame doesn't go out we have a link to this product as well on our product page so you know exactly what torch we're using let's go ahead and pop these bubbles and we're gonna do it three times [Applause] again we're not trying to get it all at once we're gonna do this three times so just keep that torch moving in a nice steady pace I pretend I'm hosing off a driveway with the hose about that pace keep in mind when you're torching not to overlap over your plastic too long because you'll melt that plastic that's a nice hot flame so just be careful and be aware of your masking in your room so that you don't cause holes in your masking now what I'm gonna do because it's torched our first time is I'm gonna go address those edges but this time I'm not gonna roll my brush over the surface I'm gonna keep it right on that router edge and just do those edges with really long strokes okay let's torch this a second time here we go [Music] [Music] boy this is laying out like a sheet of glass we're just gonna torch it one more time and then we're gonna walk away will be all said and done here we go [Applause] [Music] hey guys we like to wait a few days before we actually install our legs so we'll come back in about four or five days we'll flip this over and we'll show you how we install our legs and remove the drips with our 50 grit metal sanding disc we really hope you enjoyed this video we had an absolute blast making this project I can't tell you enough how these colors glow that the pictures don't do it justice but the pictures still look pretty dang good I just can't believe how this came out I'm very excited about it I can't wait to use this table please comment below let us know what kind of project you'd like to see next would you like to see a three-dimensional piece of driftwood get coated so you learn how to do these 3d objects or would you like to see another River table with a new technique you let us know below and we'll get it out as soon as we can again thanks for your time thanks for watching

baking fundamentals course and today I\nwant to talk to you about how to measure everything properly for baking. Now as\nyou may know baking is an exact science and it's extremely important that you\nknow how to measure your ingredients properly. Now there are two different\ntechniques for measuring ingredients. The first is measuring by weight and the\nsecond is measuring by volume. Now I want to talk about how to properly do each\ntechnique and the differences between the two. When you're measuring by weight\nyou're going to use a scale to measure each ingredient to the exact weight that\nyou need for your recipe. Now this is an extremely accurate way to measure. When\nyou measure by volume you're actually using a measuring cup and filling it up\nto the top with your ingredient so you're measuring it by the amount of\nspace or the amount of volume that it takes up in the cup. Now this can be a\nless accurate way to measure because it's really easy to accidentally pack\ntoo much of an ingredient into your measuring cup or to not fill it quite\nall the way to the top. Okay so let's go ahead and start by talking about\nmeasuring by weight. Now when you measure by weight you're going to need a kitchen\nscale and these are fairly inexpensive, you can easily find one for less than\n$20. And when you measure by weight you have a few different options of the\nunits of measurement you will use. Now in the United States we're the most familiar\nwith the Imperial system and those units of measurement are ounces and pounds. Now\nthe rest of the world uses the metric system and those units of measurement\nare grams and kilograms. I'd really like to encourage you to\nstart learning how to measure by grams because that is the smallest form of\nmeasurement and going to be the most accurate. To use\na digital scale turn the scale on and use the unit button to change the\nsettings. Grams is the preferred setting for baking. Set your bowl on the scale\nand then press the tare button to zero out the scale so that the bowl is not\ncounted in the weight then begin measuring out your ingredient. You can\nsee the written lesson for downloadable charts for converting common baking\ningredients from volume measurements to weight measurements. Okay so let's go\nahead and talk about measuring by volume. Now there are also a few\ndifferent ways you can measure by a volume. With the Imperial system in the\nU. S. we have teaspoons, tablespoons, fluid ounces, cups, pints, quarts and gallons. Now\nif the metric system they have milliliters and liters. Now remember when\nmeasuring by volume you are using a measuring cup to fill it up to the\namount that you need of your ingredient. Now there are a few different tools you\nneed when measuring by volume. This is a liquid measuring cup and you want to\nonly use this when you are measuring liquids. And this is a dry measuring cup\nand you only want to use this when you are measuring dry ingredients. Now these\ntwo units of measurement are actually measuring exactly the same. If I filled\nthis up with a cup of water and I poured it into my dry measuring cup it would\ncome right up to the top but the way these two are designed differently\nit just works much better and more accurately if you use this for measure\nliquid and this for measuring dry. When you measure a dry ingredient in this, it\nwould be very difficult to level the ingredient off at the top and make sure\nthat it is very accurate so you definitely don't want to use this when\nmeasuring dry ingredients. Now these are measuring spoons and you would use this\nfor measuring small amounts of ingredients like spices or extracts or\nanything like that. Now one thing I really want to review is the difference\nbetween fluid ounces which is a volume measurement and ounces which is a weight\nmeasurement. Now these two things are not exactly the same. You might have been\ntaught that one cup equals eight ounces. Well it is true that one cup does equal\neight fluid ounces but that does not mean that one cup will always weigh\neight ounces. Now the reason this can be really confusing is because water, milk,\nmelted butter and a few other liquid ingredients actually do equal the same\namount by volume and weight . So one cup of water would equal eight ounces by\nweight but this is not true for most dry ingredients and a lot of other heavier\nliquid ingredients like honey or molasses or something like that. Now the\nexample I really like to use to illustrate this point is think about\nfilling up a one cup measuring cup with feathers and then a one cup measuring\ncup with lead. Now are these two things going to equal the same amount by weight?\nAbsolutely not they are the same by volume but they are not going to weigh\nthe same. Okay so let's talk about how to properly use all of these tools. Now when\nyou're measuring liquid ingredients with your liquid measuring cup you want to\nfill it up to the line and set it down on your counter and then get down at eye\nlevel with it so that you can see that the ingredient is exactly at the line.\nNow when you're using dry measuring cups you want to fill it up all the way to\nthe top and actually overflowing a little bit and then use\nknife or the back of a spoon to level it off so that it is a very clean line on\ntop. To measure powdery dry ingredients like flour or powdered sugar start by\nstirring it and then lightly spoon it into your measuring cup without packing\nit down at all. Make sure the cup is overflowing and\nthen use a knife to level it off. If you are going to measure by volume, using\nthis proper technique is extremely important. This 1 cup of flour measured\nthe proper way weighs 120 grams and this next cup of flour measured by packing it\ninto the measuring cup is weighing in at 151 grams. This difference is significant\nin baking. Brown sugar is the one ingredient that you do want to lightly\npack into your measuring cup before leveling it off. When measuring things\nlike spices or baking powder or baking soda make sure that you also level off\nyour measuring spoon. So that is it for today's lesson now I want to give you\nyour homework assignment. I'd love for you to practice measuring flour by\nvolume and see how accurate you can get with it. Measure out one cup of flour\nusing the spoon and level technique that we showed in the video and then pour it\ninto a bowl on a scale and see how accurate you are. One cup of flour should\nweigh a hundred and twenty grams. Now you can share your results of this\nassignment in our private Facebook group where we are continuing the conversation\nafter each lesson or you can share it on your social media using the hashtag #BBbakingschool. I'll see you guys next time. Bye!", "7YEKzgVGAgk": "I came here and welcome back to my channel thank you to all of my new subscribers into those are you coming back welcome back this is faith family and fashion and today we are cooking so we are trying this recipe has been pinned on Pinterest like enormous amounts of time and I thought I'd give it a try so this is million dollar spaghetti and so what I've got going is I chopped up a bell pepper and an onion I chopped up part of an onion this is like a huge onion so a chocolate part of that I chopped up two bell peppers or a bell pepper and a half because they were kind of starting to go bad you know like they needed to be used so I'm probably not gonna use all of that maybe half of that and I have got some ground turkey I've got some what is this sour cream cottage cheese new patella cheese like light cream cheese and then I've got some Hunt's basil diced basil garlic oregano and then a small can of tomato sauce you can totally use spaghetti sauce if you have it and then I just have some regular like mozzarella and pizza cheese I did buy a new thing of mozzarella but it'll cost per cup so uh yeah so I thought I would just use these at first okay and then over here it's really dark over here my light went out so I'm trying to like use this light so you guys can see better maybe so I have my spaghetti cooking it's to analyze two minutes so no okay so that's nice spaghetti and I am about to cook up my onions and peppers these are eggs those have nothing to do with the - those are just for my lunch this our breakfast this next week and then over here I've got some Italian seasoning some black pepper some parsley salt and some garlic and I'm going to put some a little bit of oil in this pan I think I'm gonna grab my coconut oil just because it's healthier so well let's do that they have absolutely nothing to do with the dinner but for some reason I just like watching my boy go okay so let's jump back in this surrogate Tucker okay so what I did was I put in my onion half of the bell peppers that I cooked and some chopped garlic and then I rinsed my spaghetti noodles and came over here okay here we go so this was my cheese mixture this is eight ounces of low fat cream cheese it is 8 ounces of cottage cheese 8 ounces of cream cheese you can substitute ricotta cheese for cottage cheese if you have it or like it better personally I like cottage cheese and then 1/4 cup of sour cream and then some more chopped garlic and some Italian seasoning and I'll put the recipe down below what I'm about to do is I'm going to put this ground meat in the pan with the onions and peppers and get that cooked and then I'm going to add the tomato sauce to it and then I think we are about ready to assemble so let me do some more and I'll come back so it looks like sorry here looks likely yes so I mean onion the peppers and garlic are all cooked so I'm gonna pour in my tomatoes these are diced basil like you know and then also my canned spaghetti sauce I am really sorry this is dark I'm gonna try to light this up in editing so do that stir this around let this cook for a few minutes and then we will get ready to assemble we have a 90 by 13 pan and it called for a stick of butter and you cut it and you put half down inside the pan no I did just go ahead and spray the pan because I always have a fear of everything sticking so this is what we start with and then we put in half the noodles half of the cheese mixture the other half of the noodles the other half of the cheese mixture and then we top it with a meat sauce so let's get going on this half of the noodles on top of the butter and the noodles I did rinse them after I drain them because if you don't they get really sticky and then sometimes they can even still get sticky if you don't use them right away so if you are cooking with noodles you need to bake them you rinse them or you drain them and they get really gummy and sticky go ahead and run them under some cool water and if you're gonna put them in the oven and reheat them anyway and it gets all that starch off and makes them really nice and loose and not sticky and gummy anymore so let's do the cream cheese later here is the noodles on top of the butter with the cheese mixture on top of that we're just gonna do this again let's see if I can do this it may have more noodles than I need spread this out I have a stand for my phone or my camera I mean I can't seem to find it I will link the recipe below or provide it in the description if you want to try this so this is a complete Pinterest try here I've never done this before so I guess we will see a Pinterest success or fail recipe here okay I cannot do the cheese mixture one-handed so let me get other noodles you see me do that I did the rest of the cheese mixture and then I take the rest of the butter and I put it on top and I pressed it down because I am wondering how all of this meat is going to fit on top but let's see what it looks like I'm going to tell you if you guys can tell meat sauce is piled own and that's with me taking the spoon and kind of digging down in there trying to make some room so the recipe says to cover it and foil and bake it for 30 minutes I'm not getting any foil over this I don't think so I'm gonna bake this for 30 minutes pull it out put some old cheese on top because there's not enough in and already bake it for 10 more minutes and then we can eat so I'll see you guys in 30 minutes okay y'all so here it is million dollar spaghetti no I do mix my cheese's so I did put a little bit of I had leftover some pizza mix cheese and I did put a little bit of cheddar cheese on here I'd never thought of doing that before I thought that was like such a big no-no was to mix cheddar with Italian cheeses until I seen somebody else do it Cheddar's to sharp it's kind of nice to cut through all of that rich creamy Italian cheese mixture so I did put a little bit of that on top I cooked it I didn't do the whole ten minutes I did about eight minutes so this is what it looks like I'll show you here in a second when we cut some put it on a plate you know with any kind of casserole you kind of want to let it sit for a few minutes otherwise it's gonna fall apart so we're just having this with a bag of salad some ranch dressing some fresh cut up pineapple pineapple and I didn't buy it I bought it and cut it up I just reuse in a container and I have already cooked our garlic bread and chopped that up so that is our dinner and when I played it here it is I'll plate it up a million dollars spaghetti or salad some bread so this is it let's see we'll get a taste test in here hold on it is food you like it awesome so you think this is a pass or a fail as far as a Pinterest recipe pass awesome okay so you heard it so now we're gonna eat dinner thank you guys so much for spending this time with us I hope you enjoyed this I'll put this recipe down in the downbar and as always remember to thank god for today because it truly is a gift and we'll see you next time say bye bye like it it's me remember to subscribe just subscribe", "uSe5j9ZBqwY": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] uh [Music] what's up guys welcome to xmd life if you're new to our channel welcome welcome welcome so today's video is going to be date night video or date night in should i say we're going to have a date night here at home so i decided to make david a milk that he requested he requested for me to make the viva chicken the persian chicken the baked persian chicken or whatever so i found a recipe and i'll link it in the description below because i did not film me prepping the chicken and everything um so that's what i'm gonna make for him and then i'm also gonna do some cilantro lime rice to go with it so i'm really really excited um i'm gonna try to get a couple clips and videos of the chicken and the rice so you guys can see uh what we have done um but yeah so i wanted to come on here and let you guys know what's up what's up with that i'm super super excited i made the marinade i made a chopped a bowl of cilantro for the cilantro lime lime rice so i'm super super excited uh cilantro lime rice is super easy to make basically you get a pan you put a little bit oil and then you put your chopped onions a little bit of garlic powder then you add your rice brown your rice a little bit stir it up and then you add your your liquids let your rice cook and fluff after it fluffs then you want to add in your lime juice and your cilantro so that's super super easy as far as the persian chicken goes guys that's a little more tedious you have to make a marinade first and then you make the green sauce to pour over top of it or put on the side of the plate and i'll link that in the description super super simple as well but you do have to go get a few ingredients if you don't already have them at home majority of the ingredients already had minus like cilantro and i think like some basil and stuff like that but i went to the store because you know your girl's on point with cooking and i eventually will do a video on how i make the persian chicken so you guys can see i'm sorry my dog is barking but yeah so we're gonna get this date night install it y'all gonna look cute today so i got a little maternity shirt it's a little too big so i just had it off but yeah with my little holy jeans and my boots i said i had to get cute and then of course i fluffed my hair made it look all nice and pretty for today i'm not putting on any makeup though so uh nope i might put on a little bit of chapstick just because my lips are chapped because it's winter time it's cold here so you know your lips get a little ashy you know you're trying to have it ashy all right so i'll see you guys soon i'm gonna get this chicken in the oven i'm waiting on the oven to heat up and right now currently it's at 3 80 it's got to get to 4 25 so yeah super excited all right see you soon all right guys so i got my gloves on because i hate touching chicken um i just got through marinating it for over an hour in the refrigerator so i'm putting it on my roasting pan to place in the oven i'm trying to figure out what to do with these little wings here because i've never made a whole chicken this is literally my first whole chicken here [Music] here i'm just pouring over my leftover marinade i didn't even waste it it smells so good and i tasted it before i throw the chicken and it tastes amazing as you can see i am placing the chicken in the oven on 425 degrees for 25 minutes then i'm going to drop it to 375 and bake it for an hour the excitement is real [Music] here i have my olive oil and a little bit of butter um bringing it to a little sizzle there here i am adding my onions bringing them to a little sizzle followed up with some garlic paste [Music] next i'll add a little bit of salt a little bit of pepper yes just let it get ready to add the rice boom [Music] i cook the rice just a little bit and just kind of brown it up just slightly next i'm adding one and a half cups of water and i'm gonna cover i forgot to record me adding one ounce of blond juice and the chocolate stuff and i'm just gonna sizzle it up just a bit next i am taking my lovely [Music] [Music] lovely chicken oh my gosh so so good all right mans is back he just dropped off kaya for the evening get kid free we are kid free and everybody get down this lovely meal my wonderful beautiful amazing wife made and um can't wait let's dig in all right babe let's see you want the leg yeah it works that fine leg yeah [Music] it looks so good it always like falls apart y'all this chicken is amazing look at that so that pan's probably still pretty hot oh yeah it's like super i'll add on some of tender plantains i probably shouldn't put it on paper towels i'm getting stuck to them yeah it's stuck to it i hope these plantains are good i've tried to make plantains before and they didn't come out so hot so i'm moving this time they came out a little better since i got a paper towel because last time we didn't know one no we didn't know that they had been like black okay before this sauce it's stuck to the paper towel y'all don't put them on the paper towel after you fry them i thought i needed to so he got a little piece of paper towel on there i don't mind eating a little paper then we got our cilantro lime rice vanilla that y'all don't like my food touching so if you see me being very meticulous it's because i don't like my food touching i'm a little on the weird side about that yep sauce sauces at the table to drizzle on the chicken what kind of sauce is that called again um green sauce it's the persian green sauce yeah so super excited all right guys this is what it's looking like [Music] excuse our baby chair this is our little set up here i sit on the right because he's left-handed and i'm right-handed and we pump elbows yeah we'll bump elbows the whole time yeah all right so i'm going to end it here and i'll come back and tell you how our meal was but this is now our time yep and we're going to enjoy our scrumptious meal here talk to you soon oh i forgot to record me putting the lovely green sauce i'll try to do this in slow motion oh my gosh what's up guys hey hey so we just finished our meal yes we did let's go my god i think that by far is the best chicken i have ever made yeah ever hands down and i make some really good she baked it it wasn't even on the grill smoke nothing it was it's amazing yeah by far the best you guys have to do this recipe and if you guys want me to do a follow along video of how i made the chicken um just put that in the comments i kind of gave you like a gist of what i did as far as putting in an oven but if you guys want to see me do a video showing you step by step how to do it just put that in the comments below because by far the best chicken i have ever ever had by far um i outdid myself and i put that sauce on my rice and the rice was amazing too yeah yeah the plantains they were good yeah they're a little tough though so i think they needed to be a little more like right they weren't ripe enough yeah but they still tasted good yeah they still have really good flavor in the rice though with the chicken like you take a bite of the chicken with the green sauce and then the bite with the rice oh my god just amazing i'm not saying that because i'm pregnant either i'm saying that because it's too late i'm not pregnant legit is good it's legitimately like excellent excellent as you can see our plates go r empty oh well now we're on to dessert yes dessert time i'm still on this sauce man this green sauce i made it is so good yeah i was telling her the simplest things make the best food and like the sauce and like the chicken is real simple ingredients and that is great yeah yeah it's a little work though but i mean not too much the only thing is that you have to make the marinade and you got to make the sauce and then you let the marinade sit on the chicken for about an hour the the hardest part is just waiting on it to be done yeah i just smell it outside it smells so good oh my gosh i mean amazing the aromas in here yes it can make me eat another plate i gotta save from the dessert though yeah but we will show you we have a midnight snack [Music] yeah yeah we'll jump up on that chicken all right so we'll show you guys what we have for dessert it's a surprise i don't know what he got he went out and got dessert and has not told me what he's gotten so i'm excited to see [Music] very very excited oh and this is not wine it is mango juice i just want to feel fancy and put it in my cute little cup because we don't we haven't been able to get many date nights so we got to get the fancy fancy cups out he's rocking his beer i put my beer in my glass all right so we'll see you back in a second y'all look at him being all sneaky up there with the dessert you see him you gotta [Music] i'm still sticking my finger in this green sauce i can't see me i'll try the green sauce has a kick just got me just now i think i got like a chunk of the jalapeno just now i'm so curious okay all right what is it it is cheesecake [Music] butter pecan cheesecake and strawberry pound cake cheesecake oh my god i'm excited yeah baby this is probably so good oh my gosh all right so we will see you guys hope you enjoyed our meal for date night we'll check you guys out later bye", "l-QjrlHjdUg": "today we're making tortellini totally from scratch and we're gonna serve it in broth with some English peas grab 300 grams ten and a half ounces or two cups of double zero flour dump it out on your counter and make it deep well in the center now all-purpose flour makes a decent pasta dough too so use it if that's all you have okay pour in a mixture of two whole eggs and five yolks now increasing the ratio of yolks give the dough a more delicate and rich flavour but you could just use three whole eggs instead now add a quarter teaspoon or about a gram of fine sea salt along with one teaspoon or about 3 grams of extra virgin olive oil grab a fork and begin to incorporate some of the flour into the egg mixture just make sure you don't break that wall of flour surrounding the liquids or you're gonna have a bit of a mess on your hands when you have something that resembles a paste ditch the fork and cut in the wet ingredients to the remaining flour with a dough scraper honestly you could just skip this step and use your hands if you prefer but a scraper is a great tool to have when making pasta after a few minutes of pressing and working the wet and dry ingredients together the dough is gonna be kind of shaggy you'll have some stuck to your work surface so use a scraper or something with a flat edge to loosen it then work those bits into the dough knead the dough with the palm of your hand press down and away then rotate and repeat do this for a few minutes then give the counter one last scrape and instead of incorporating this stuff just toss it it's way too dry and it'll ruin your dough now continue kneading for another three or four minutes or until the pasta dough takes on a silky smooth texture this means the gluten in the dough has started to develop form a dough into a ball like so then wrap it in some plastic film and let it rest in the fridge for about an hour so now we need to prepare a filling for our tortellini and you can go about this two ways the easy less complicated route is to just grab some sausage at the store this is chicken and garlic sausage and I plan to make chicken tortellini so it fits the theme but you could pretty much use any type just remove the casing and Bob's your uncle here's the more traditional and adventurous route grab and set up your food processor remove the lid into the bowl add the following ingredients five ounces 142 grams or about three-quarters of a cup of chilled and cubed chicken two ounces 57 grams are about 1/2 cup of children Adela the same measurement of chilled diced pancetta 1/4 ounce 7 grams or 2 tablespoons of grated parm 1 egg white leaves from one sprig of rosemary and a half ounce 14 grams or 1 tablespoon of heavy cream a healthy dose of freshly ground black pepper is always a must I'm adding about a quarter teaspoon here and last but not least a solid quarter teaspoon of freshly grated nutmeg now pop the top back on your food processor I seem to be having a little bit of trouble here there we go good job Tim and blitz the filling for about 10 to 20 seconds until all the ingredients are broken down and you get something that resembles a loose finely ground sausage this is called a forcemeat by the way transfer the filling to a small bowl and make sure you get every last bit of it because you certainly don't want to waste any and we're done with the food processor so you can put that away then place the filling in the fridge and hold it there until we're ready to make tortellini speaking of which it's time to roll out the pasta so grab the dough and cut off 1/4 of it then wrap the rest back up in the plastic film this will keep it from drying out as you work with a smaller piece now have some loose flour on hand and give everything a dusting then grab a rolling pin and well start rolling I don't have one of those crazy long rolling pins that's meant to specifically roll out pasta and I'm fairly sure most of you don't either so do this roll the dough out a bit then rotate it every once in a while to stretch it out in both length and width just don't roll it out wider than the width of your rolling pin the end result will be an elongated oval and the dough should be thin enough so that you can kind of see your hand through it it'll be probably about a sixteenth of an inch thick another option in the one that I almost always go to is using a pasta roller this requires less elbow grease and speeds up the process quite a bit so dial your rollers to the widest setting and start feeding your piece of dough through the machine just remember to flatten it out with a rolling pin before the first pass now after you've run the dough through the first and second settings fold it into thirds give it a quick hit with the rolling pin and start it all over again do this a few times and then run the pasta sheet through the rest of the settings until you reach the second from last this is typically number seven on most machines when you're done the sheet should be the same width as the rollers the first thing I do here is trim off the dry edges and cut the ends to square off the pasta sheet next make two straight cuts from one end to the other leaving you with three strips of pasta that are even in width now make perpendicular cuts to form evenly shaped squares about two-and-a-half to three centimetres in width add small amounts of filling a little less than 1/2 teaspoons worth to the center of each pasta square for a visual reference that ends up being a little bit more than the size of a hazelnut lightly spray the pasta with some water now this will make the surface of the dough tackier so it seals better when forming the tortellini hold the pasta so it's shaped like a diamond then fold the bottom point up to the top to form a triangle press the left and right edges firmly to thin the dough and seal the filling now fold the top point in toward you then wrap the two bottom corners around your index finger so they overlap each other and finally pinch the dough together to firmly thin and form the Tortelli know again for good measure bring the bottom point up to meet the top point then firmly pinch the left and right edges to form a triangle fold the top point in toward you then wrap the bottom points around your finger and pinch again to form a totally no now that all the dough is used up it's time to cook these little guys so bring some chicken broth up to a boil and drop in your tortellini for this recipe one-quarter broth works pretty well add the English peas and simmer everything for about three to four minutes or until the tortellini are cooked through but the dough still has a little bit of a bite to it oh yeah and don't forget to check the seasoning of your broth before serving now ladle a tortellini broth and English peas into a bowl you can go family-style or individual servings here just remember to offer some freshly grated Parmesan cheese to those who can't go without it like myself thanks for watching don't forget to

you I haven't been much of a housewife most of my life I focused a lot of my career the past few years as a TV news anchor and reporter but I recently quit that job and now I'm a stay-at-home mom but over the past 15 years every single time I went to a friend's giving I would find the best recipes and ask my friends for those recipes so here are three of the easiest most delicious recipes I have found before we get started though I would really appreciate if you would go down below and hit the subscribe button and join this YouTube family also I will be posting all of the recipes down below in the description box so this first recipe is for a great green bean casserole who doesn't love green bean casserole right for this you'll need 18 ounces of frozen green beans they need to be thawed and drained 3/4 cup milk 1 10 and 3/4 ounce can of condensed cream of mushroom soup 1/8 teaspoon of seasoned pepper and then two point eight ounces of french fried onions so I told you this recipe is easy right you simply take all of the ingredients and mix them into a 1 and a half to 2 quart casserole dish [Music] next you'll put in the oven for 30 minutes at 350 degrees after you bake the green bean casserole for 30 minutes you do want to top it with a few more of the fried onions and then cook it again until it's golden brown so when we're cooking we also like it to smell good in here right the food smells good but it's also nice to light a fall candle today we're lighting autumn day from Bath & Body Works it's one of my favorites I actually have a big one in it and then a small one what are you eating toast ooh you made that didn't you peanut butter and butter sauce all by yourself what a little chef is mommy's food gonna taste good how does good as yours you also do a recipe on that so let's get started on the second video right or the second recipe next up is an amazing potato dish called potatoes Elizabeth and for that you need one large package of frozen hash browns which is around 2 pounds and it needs to be southern style then a can of either cream of chicken or a cream of mushroom soup I like cream of mushroom soup 2 cups of grated cheddar cheese 1 cup chopped onion 1/2 cup of melted butter 1 tablespoon of salt and then on top he'll crush 2 cups of corn flakes then you want to combine all of the ingredients aside from the corn flakes and a little bit of the melted butter in a large bowl [Music] I have some cute helpers now and the next step is do now to spray it yeah don't spray it in your eyes I mean mommy should help you yeah you need to spray a 12 by 19 piano or grease it right your mommy to help okay yeah we might need to make sure you don't spray it in your eyes when you spray it all right so yeah what we're gonna do now is we're gonna move all of that into this bowl this pan and then we're gonna top it with those corn flakes so we've stirred in melted butter with okay [Music] then you'll bake it at 350 degrees for 45 minutes our third and final recipe is for candied yams now here's a look at the ingredients that you need for that first you need five medium yams or sweet potatoes 1/2 cup of salt and melted butter 3/4 cup of light brown sugar 1/2 cup of granulated sugar 2 tablespoons of honey 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon of ground allspice 1/4 teaspoon of ground nutmeg and then 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract the first step is you want to peel and slice all of your yams into 1/2 inch rounds make sure you cut them evenly so they'll bake evenly [Music] next you want to take all of the ingredients aside from the yams and mix them together in a bowl once you have all of those ingredients mixed together it's time to mix in the yams make sure you evenly coat them next you want to transfer everything into a 9 by 13 inch dish cover it with aluminum foil and then bake it for 30 minutes at 400 degrees after 30 minutes you do want to remove the yams from the oven stir them and then bake them for an additional 20 minutes or until they're nice and tender [Music] I hope you enjoyed this video and will help any of you who are looking for Thanksgiving recipes if you did like it I would really appreciate it if you

This just looks too damn good. mmmm....mmmmm That's good, I'm gonna spin this burger around when I shoot so you don't see that giant bite I just took out of it. Oh, well. All right. Let's let's start that over. Hey guys, Tim with Kitchen & Craft and today we're discussing the secret on how to make a better Beyond Burger. You know those plant-based meat patties that you find all over the place nowadays. By the way, this video is a collaboration with Marlon Doll. His channel focuses on healthy, tasty and affordable meals. So take a look at his version of the ultimate Beyond Burger when you're done watching my video. I'll leave a link toward the end for you. Marlon, and I would love to hear what burger you prefer. So leave a comment on either channel and let us know which is your favorite Beyond Burger. All right back to the discussion. This is my first time using this type of product and I gotta say I'm pretty impressed. They've done a great job imitating the look and the texture of beef but I gotta say it doesn't necessarily kill it on flavor for me. I mean. you can't just cook one of these burgers off, slap it between two buns, squirt some ketchup on it and call it a day. It's just not going to do it. So my secret is to pair it with high quality, highly flavorful, delicious ingredients. It doesn't sound like a huge secret, but there's plenty of people that'll go for a plain-jane burger and be sorely disappointed. with flavor aside, I think the biggest story here is the sustainability of beyond burger products in relation to beef. But that's a discussion for another day and quite frankly a different Channel All right back to the burger. Beyond Meat has done 90% of the work for us when it comes to the patty. They've made the burger and they pre-formed it. All we got to do is cook it so most of this video is gonna be about all of the other things that I'm pairing with it. I'm gonna knock out some delicious, super soft hamburger buns. We're gonna make some quick homemade ranch dressing I'll shred some lettuce and slice some red onion and let's not forget his spicy cucumber pickles. The recipe of which I will leave in the upper right-hand side of this video. This particular burger might not be vegan or vegetarian, but it certainly can be with some quick substitutions. It's my version of a better Beyond Burger and it's damn delicious so I hope you like it. It's time to check out my recipe so let's go. Hey guys, welcome to my video on the secret to making a better Beyond Burger. Hint...it's all about the fixin's. Alright, we're gonna kick things off by adding some warm water to a mixing bowl. The water should be about a 100\u00b0F. Add a little bit of sugar, stir that around to dissolve it and then go in with your yeast. Let that bloom for about five minutes, then add the remaining sugar, your kosher salt, all of the unsalted butter, which should be at room temp, one egg, then all of your flour. If you have a stand mixer go ahead and attach your bowl with the dough hook. If you don't no worries at all. This is really easy to mix by hand. I just happen to have a stand mixer So, you know, it'd be silly for me not to use it. If you're using a KitchenAid mixer turn it to setting number two. I find this is the best setting when kneading dough . At first, this dough's gonna look kind of dry and then it's gonna start to get shaggy and eventually everything is just gonna come together and you'll have a beautiful dough. But if for some reason the dough is too wet or dry, you can add some flour or water a little bit at a time until it comes together to the right consistency. So after about 10 minutes of kneading your dough should look exactly like this. It should be silky smooth in texture, have pulled away from the sides of the bowl, but the dough should still sort of be sticking to the bottom of the bowl. Now it's time to generously flour your work surface and turn the dough out on to it. Continue kneading for a few minutes by pulling the edges of the dough and folding them in toward the center. Then, flip the dough over and start rolling It counterclockwise or clockwise Doesn't really matter, but roll it with your hands to form a dough ball. Place your dough ball in a lightly greased bowl, cover with plastic film or a wet towel and let it double in size. It should take about an hour. Alright, once again, turn your dough out onto a floured work surface and cut it into eight pieces. They should weigh approximately 80 grams each. This weight works perfectly for the Beyond burger patty sizes. If you want larger buns, cut the dough into six pieces that weigh about a hundred grams each and they'll be a much more appropriate for half-pound burger sizes. Place your dough balls on a parchment lined sheet pan and arrange them using the 2-1-2 to layout. Then press each bun down a little bit. That'll keep them from puffing up too much on their second rise. Hit each piece of dough with a little bit of cooking spray or brush them with oil. This is gonna keep them from sticking to the plastic that you need to cover the dough with so it doesn't dry out during its second rise. Okay, after an hour or so your buns should have doubled in size. The final step before baking is to brush each bun with some egg wash. Be delicate here. You don't want to press too hard or you'll deflate the dough and then you just have to start all over again. Or you could just admit defeat and go to the store and buy some potato rolls. After 15 minutes in a 400\u00b0F oven, this is what your buns will look like. Not too shabby eh? Place them on a baking rack and then cover them with a towel. Let the buns rest for about 15-20 minutes so they can cool off and soften up a bit. Now, on to some good old ranch dressing. Add your sour cream, your mayonnaise, your dried herbs and spices, some salt and pepper and a little bit of buttermilk, then stir until everything's combined. As an optional ingredient you can add some lemon zest or a little bit of lemon juice. That'll give the dressing a brighter note. But again, totally optional. Go ahead and place that ranch in a container and store it in the fridge until your burgers are ready. We are moving on with our topping prep by shredding some lettuce, slicing some red onion and grabbing some of those super delicious spicy cucumber pickles that you can make with a recipe that I will leave in the upper right-hand side of this video. And I almost forgot the American cheese. Not so elegant with a serrated knife am I? Anyways, when your buns cool off, cut one in half, butter it up and toast it off on a preheated griddle. Now ladies and gents, it's time for the main event. Grab your Beyond Meat patties, season one side up with some salt and pepper, brush it with some oil and slap it on the griddle. Make sure your patty has good contact with the griddle. That'll help with browning and improve the flavor. When you're ready to flip, season the patty with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then add a drizzle of oil and proceed. After about three minutes of cooking on each side, it's time to add your cheese. I'm going for a quick melt here so I need some steam and a bowl to help me with that. Now that the buns and the rancher made, the toppings are sliced, the patties cooked and the cheese is melted, it's time to build this burger. I really hope you enjoyed the video.

Bye.", "OeF6kkuIMJE": "so in this video I will show you how I built an outdoor epoxy resin bar top with a glowing winding river using reclaimed sinker cypress wood the bar top is 11 feet long 21 inches wide and 2 inches thick towards the end of the video I'll also show you how I managed to transport this massive table across half the country in the back of my pickup truck to start this live edge epoxy resin bar top I contacted a local sinker Cypress logger to purchase a slab I decided to buy directly from the source for price and I wanted to meet him he was very knowledgeable and had a massive inventory of sinker Cypress the slab I chose was 14 feet long 28 inches wide and two and a half inches thick I hauled the slab home in my truck without issue however I forgot my bed extender so I was a little nervous more on my bed extender later in the video the underside of the slab was obviously laying on the river bottom because these indentations don't appear to be the pecky fungus the objective here was to remove the loose dirt and debris so I could get a better view of the green pattern and the overall condition of the wood next I flipped the log over and sanded the top down to 80 grit I carried the slab outside and cleaned up the live edge on both sides with my grinder and a cut Sol extreme shaping disc this thing saved me so much time I'll be sure to link it up in the description below along with all of the other tools and materials I use for this project I flipped the table over and cleaned up the spots I couldn't reach with my rotary sander my customer wanted one live edge facing the pool and one straight edge facing the bar sadly I was forced to rip it down the middle since this slab has to live edges I brought the slab back inside and sketched a winding river to reinforce the middle of the table I used square steel tubing first I use the tubing as a guide and Mark the lines next I use my router and a homemade jig I built in about five minutes to rout a channel a little wider and deeper than the tubing with my daughter's help I secured the steel tubing in the channels with bondo she is encouraging you to like this video I didn't realize she did that after the bondo dried I sanded away the excess to build the resin mold I decided to use styrofoam insulation I placed three sheets down the length of the slab and secured them to each other using silicone tape and packing tape next I covered the entire side with packing tape then Vaseline to serve as a release agent I flipped the mold over clamped it to the slab and flipped the entire thing over the slab was really heavy I made sure the resin mold was 5 inches longer at each end I use my razor knife to cut the underside of the styrofoam halfway in depth this allowed me to form the end of each table before the first resin pour I checked the resin temperature and it was a bit low so I let it sit in the Sun for about 10 minutes until it reached 70 degrees I use a laser temperature gun to get an accurate temperature prior to every pore I mixed the first two batches of resin the same way first I mix the resin per the instructions and stirred next I added the glow powder and third for about five more minutes my blog contains the amounts of resin glow powder and other material I used I'll leave a link in the description if you're interested I poured the resin on one end of the table and move my way down to cover the entire bottom the steel bars prevented the resin from running down the length of the river so I had to pour equal amounts in each section I used my heat gun to remove the air bubbles I turned off the lights and tested the glow powder with a blacklight once the resin cured I cleaned and dried the blue fire glass I find that a strainer works really well for this I like to spread enough fire glass to cover the bottom resin layer but still allow enough space for the glue powder to shine through I also make sure the glass is below the riverbank so it doesn't protrude from the top once the fire glass is in place I took my time and filled the river with multiple layers of resin I remove the bubbles with my heat gun after each layer the goal here is to fill the table with resin without going over the top edge which causes unnecessary work in fact it is better to come up a little short of the edge and sand down rather than vice versa [Music] I use my track saw to trim each end of the table down to the final size first I made a straight mark across the table with my t-square next I used a very old blade to cut each end using multiple passes I had to cut through a small amount of fire glass because I didn't leave myself enough room when spreading the fire glass I removed the resin mold and took the table outside to clean up the bottom with my grinder and a 50 grit metal sanding disc the resin spread a little in the bottom during the initial pours because of the uneven spots on the underside of the table I brought the table back inside and used my track saw in order to cut it to its final with some resin spilled over on the top of the bar top so I cleaned that up with my rotary sander as well as any high spots that I could find my rotary sander speed was turned up too high at one point and it caused white spots which are tiny bubbles that get filled with the resin residue after sanding I use my drill and countersink bit to remove these I hand sanded the surface of the resin and decided to pour one more layer of resin on the river to raise it just a bit it was about 1/8 of an inch lower than it should have been it's much easier to add a little resin than sand the entire table down 1/8 of an inch first I wrapped a scrap piece of wood with silicone tape and nailed it to each end next I sealed it with hot glue and poured the resin [Music] I actually needed more than I thought I ended up using 2 32 ounce batches after the resin cured I removed the boards and use my rotary sander on a low speed setting to knock down a few high spots at one end of the table a variable speed sander is very useful when working with resin the two areas were only about 1/32 higher than the river but it needs to be flush before the sealcoat I sanded the entire table with a soft sanding pad and 320 grit sandpaper I checked each part of the bar top where the resin river meets the wood to ensure it was flat after using my hand plane to knock down a small high spot on the end of the table I used my trim router with a 1/2 inch roundover bit on the straight side of the bar top I asked my wife to help me on the first seal coat and she was very nervous to mess up so I took the opportunity to emphasize the importance of this step in the project the purpose of the seal coat is just as the name implies it's meant to seal the surface my wife's spread the material with the squeegee back and forth and let a bead of material drip over the edge there is also a formula for seal coats which is one ounce per square foot of surface area [Music] next I use my torch to remove air bubbles I wipe the edge about once per 5 minutes for about 20 minutes to prevent any dripping I sanded the entire table with 320 grit sandpaper and repeated the process for the second and the third seal coat [Music] after I sanded the final seal coat I mix three ounces per square foot for the flood coat I used a one-eighth inch square notch trial to move the resin across the bar top at a consistent depth [Music] then I used a brush to chop the material to facilitate proper blending [Music] my torch removed the air bubbles and help flatten out the material I repeated this process for the second flood coat as well after the bar top cured for six days I flipped it over and sealed the underside with oil and urethane this is not necessary for this type of wood but it just made me feel better since the bar top would be outside I used hot glue to secure a string of black LED lights under the river this is also not necessary because the glow powder is charged by sunlight or artificial lights the black lights will charge the glue powder if the bar top is not exposed to the Sun or to any artificial lights I decided to drive this table to my customer because shipping was very expensive due to the size of the bar table first I built a box with two by fours and particle board roughly four inches longer than the table and two inches wider I used my bed extender which is actually one of the handiest tools I have I initially bought this bed extender to haul my paddle boards in my old truck but now I use it to haul lumber much longer than my truck bed it's a bed extender if its installed horizontally and it's a roof extender if it's installed vertically I'll be sure to link that up down below if you're interested so I left my house at 4:30 a.m. in Louisiana and drove 12 hours to South Carolina my wife warned me to just ship the table but as usual I didn't listen I wanted to save my customer the huge shipping expense because he was so easy to work with my travel expenses for much cheaper than the shipping expense I can assure you additionally I didn't think the drive would be too bad I delivered the table to my customer spent a few hours chatting with him and his family and got back on the road later that evening I enjoyed meeting my customer and his family however I will listen to my wife next time although I was happy to help out my customer the trip simply was not worth it it took me two days to recover [Music] for additional details on this project such as downloadable project plans materials are used and other tips and tricks that I just could not cram into this one video be sure to check out the video description below drop any questions or comments in the comment section down below and I'll do my best to answer them quickly [Music]", "zGJ9Lih79-c": "so if we know the surface area the cube varies directly as the square of the length of an edge so let's let ask me surface area and let's let L be length of an edge and it's giving us that ass equals some thing times the square of the length of an edge so that's Alice squared so when s equals K L squared and the surface area is 24 feet when the length of this edge is 2 feet so we've got 24 and we can solve for our K so the length of an edge is 2 feet and so then we can divide that over 24 divided by 4 this is 6 okay and so then I want to find the surface area of a cube with an edge that is 7 feet so the surface area is going to be 6 it's my constant and then the length of the side is 7 feet so if I compute that I get 294 square feet okay then I have a system of equations I'm going to determine if an ordered pair as a solution so this is an X and this is a y and so what I'm going to do is plug in that x and y into both equations and see if it gives me a true statement so I have 3 times negative 2 minus 5 times 1/5 and let's see what that equals and that gives me negative seven so that one is true and let's see if it this x and y pair fits the other one so I'll have negative two minus four times one fifth and I'll tell you that doesn't look promising there so I have a negative two minus four-fifths gives me negative two point eight so that one does not work so this is not a solution so it's important to check both equations because it could be a solution to one but not a solution to the other one so you have to check them both okay so next we're gonna check this equation to see if it is true here so we're going to check this X&Y pair and we're gonna plug it into again both equations so let's move it into the top one first so you have 3 times 1 minus 5 times 2 what does that give us 3 minus 5 times 2 so that's 3 minus 10 is negative 7 so that one works and then I have 1 minus 4 times 2 so like I've seen 1 minus 8 of the negative 7 and so that one checks out as well and so this is a solution so we checked that X&Y pair with both equations to make sure it worked then this one says solve this system using the substitution method and so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take equation one and I'm going to solve it for X so I'm going to get X is equal to five minus 3y and then I want to substitute that in in place of the X there in equation two so there's the X because that's something that X is equal to so in place of X I'm just going to write it that's the statement there so we'll have three so in equation two I have three and then in place of X I'm going to write five minus 3y minus 2y equals 18 and I can solve this now for y so I'm going to distribute that 3 into both of those and I get 15 minus 9y minus 2y equals 18 and so that's 15 minus 11 y equals 18 I can subtract the 15 from both sides I have negative 11 y is equal to 18 minus 15 that's three so Y is equal to three xi and that's negative 311 and then I can find out what X is so if Y is negative 3 xi then X is going to be 5 minus 3 times negative 3 11 so this is sixty-four I'm gonna end up with 64 Elevens it's gonna be five plus nine eleven so 55 elevenths plus nine eleven says sixty-four lemons so that's my X and my Y okay the next one I want to solve it using the addition elimination method and so what I want to do is I'm gonna look at the the X column and the Y column and I can see that if I multiply this top by seven each of these guys by seven I can I can add straight down and the Y's will be eliminated um so in other words my system has now become 42 X plus 7y equals 7 times four which is 28 and then i'll have 20x minus 7y equals 3 and I could just add straight down each column so if I add both sides I'll have 42 X plus 20 excuse me 62 X and then my Y 7y minus 7y that adds to zero and then 28 plus 3 is 31 so I can divide that over and I get X as 1/2 and so if X is 1/2 then I can just plug that into one of my equations and I'll just put it into this top one so I'll have 6 times 1/2 plus y equals 4 and so that gives me 3 plus y equals 4 it's like an subtracted over I get y equals 1 so X is 1/2 and y equals 1 it's alright I'm here next to each other cake for the next one that says Brian and Jayden had barbecue of potato chips and soda Brian ate 3 ounces of chips and drank two cups of soda for a total of 700 milligrams idiot Jayden ate 1 ounce of chips and 3 cups of soda and had three and 50 milligrams of sodium how much sodium is in 1 ounce of chips and how much sodium is in 1 cup of soda so let's let X be the amount of sodium in one ounce of chips and we'll let Y be the amount of sodium in a one cup of soda okay and so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make two equations one equation has to do with the amount of sodium Brian consumed so Brian had three ounces of chips so it's gonna be three times X is gonna be the amount of sodium that he ate that was in those chips plus he drank two cups of soda so 2 times y would be the amount of sodium that he ingested from soda and it totals up to 700 milligrams of sodium and then we'll make a similar statement for Jaden so Jaden ate one ounce of chips so we'll just write x and then he drank three cups of soda and he totaled with 350 milligrams of sodium okay and so what I want to do is solve that system of equations and so we could do it lots of different ways I think maybe doing an elimination might be easiest so if I could multiply everything by negative three on this bottom equation then all the two equations that I will have will be 3x plus 2y equals 700 and on the bottom we'll have negative 3x minus 9y equals 350 times negative 3 is negative 1 0 5 0 and then if I add those together I get negative 350 and I'll get negative 7y and then i get y is equal to 50 and the units of that are going to be milligrams and then if that's if that's what y is then i can take this equation 2 that I started with and I can say X is equal to 3 oh sorry X plus 3 times 50 so I get X is equal to 350 minus 3 times 50 which is 200 so 50 milligrams of sodium in one cup of soda and 200 milligrams of sodium in one ounce of the chips so that's the answer so in one ounce of chips there is 200 milligrams in any one cup of soda there is 15 milligrams um solve the nonlinear system of equations using the substitution method okay so here I want to solve it for either X or Y so I think I'm gonna take this bottom one and I'm going to solve it for X and I'm gonna get X is equal to y plus 3 and then once I do that I can I can substitute that into equation 1 and so I'm gonna get y plus 3 minus 4 squared plus y squared equals 25 so that's gonna give me y minus 1 squared plus y squared equals 25 and so that's gonna give me um let's see Y squared minus 2y plus 1 plus y squared equals 25 and I can from that I can make a quadratic so I'll have 2 y squared minus 2y minus 24 equals 0 and then if i factor that I'm gonna get to 2 y + y let's see things that multiply to give me 24 let's do it 3 and 1/8 okay and I want the 8 to be negative and the 3 to be positive definitely positive 6y minus 8y so I'm going to get Y is equal to 8 halves which is 4 and I'm going to get Y is equal to the negative 3 ok and let's find the XS that go with that so if Y is 4 then X is a is 4 plus 3 so I get 7 4 and then I'm also going to get if Y is negative 3 then X is 0 so those are my two solutions so the solution pairs have to go with each other so when y is 4 X is 7 and when y is negative 3 X is 0 so I'm using this equation to figure out what the X is that corresponds with the given Y so for the next one I want to solve this system of equations Nerys of this and go with blue um and again I can see this is a nonlinear system of equations and it looks like it's set up nicely to go ahead and and add those together so I'm just going to I'm gonna eliminate the X Y term because I want to just be able to solve for y so if I multiply this through by I see I want to get rid of the X Y term 7'o multiply this guy by negative 3 by 3 this guy by - so am i resulting equation is going to be 6x y minus 3y squared equals negative 72 and then I'm going to get negative 6x y plus 4 y squared equals 38 times 2 which is 76 okay and then I'm just gonna go ahead and add those to you and so this XY term goes away and I'm just left with I'm just left with four what I'm sorry not four four four minus 3y squared so that's just one y squared y squared equals four so I get Y is equal to plus or minus two and so then if I take those and plug them back in over here when y equals two I'm going to get two x times two minus 2 squared equals negative 24 and I can solve that for X so I get 4x and negative 24 plus 4 is gonna be minus 20 so x equals negative 5 so that's a pair that goes together is negative 5/2 and then if X when y is equal to negative 2 what do we have well that gives me 2 times x times negative 2 minus negative 2 squared equals negative 24 all right so that's gonna be a positive or sorry a negative minus 4 there so I can add that over and so I'll get again I'm negative 20 when I add that and 2 times negative 2 is negative 4x so I'm gonna get x equals positive 5 so I'm gonna get positive 5 comma and negative 2 so those are my two solutions the next one says the difference of two positive numbers is 3 and the difference of their squares is 33 you find the numbers so I'm gonna say that Y minus X is 3 and Y squared minus x squared is 33 and then I want to find those numbers and so I'm gonna get if I AB that x over I'm gonna get Y is equal to 3 plus X and then I can plug that in so I'm going to get 3 plus x squared minus X squared equals 33 and then I get I get three I get nine plus six x plus x squared minus x squared equals 33 so the experts go away I can subtract the 933 minus 9 is 24 so I get 6x equals 24 so that gives me X is X is 4 and so what does y need to be so Y needs to be when you have Y minus 4 equals 3 so I can add that over and Y is 7 so we have x equals 4 y equals 7 is my solution let's just check to make sure that is true 7 minus 4 is 3 and 7 squared minus 4 squared is 33 so yep that works all right I think that's it", "vErs30t9IBk": "good eye students are welcome to part one of the CBS mathematics review is also mental going up a question is one through ten and for the CBS review document I'll push is one to fifteen deal with measurement statistics and estimation okay alright so let's take a look at question number one so it's during a semester a student receives scores of 76 80 83 seven one eighty and seventy eight on six test what is the average what is the student outrage score for the six test so the follow-up or average is basically the sum of the elements of the set sum of elements are divided by the total number of elements in the set okay divided by number of elements now the elements in this case are the test scores okay and then we have six elements so what we're going to do is we're going to compute the sum of all the six scores which are the elements 76 plus 80 plus 83 plus 71 plus 80 plus 78 and then we're going to divide the sum by the number of scores or the number of elements in the sets so since there are six test we're going to be dividing by six okay so this is basically how you you compute some averages all right so let's go ahead and compute a song first I'm going to do that in pairs this is a 76 plus a our first 76 plus 80 is 156 and then let's do the next pair 83 plus 71 and then if you sum that up to get 154 and then 80 plus 78 the last two is 158 now I can easily add these three together it's not too difficult 156 plus 150 4 plus 158 all right so 6 is 4 is 10 plus 8 18 have 8 carry 1 5 times 3 is 15 plus 1 is 16 six carry one four ones add up to four okay so this whole expression is going to be 468 divided by six okay in different ways you can divide this let's just use a long division so that no one gets confused 468 the top goes under the division symbol R divided by six six goes into forty six or seven times because 7 times 6 is 42 I'll subtract on that we have 48 bring down the 8 of course 6 goes into 48 8 times 8 times 6 is 48 so our answer the average of the six chords is clearly 78 to the option C is our correct answer all right let's move on to question number two it says use the table below to answer the following questions on the three sections of a math test the student correctly answered the number of questions shown in a table above what percent of the questions on the entire test did student answer correctly okay so to get the percentage is just a percentage is just another expression a fraction okay so if you can get a fractional expression that will convert a fraction into that's more than two percent okay so um to get the percent correct percent correct all you just simply do in fractional form first is um you're going to divide the number answered correctly or the number correct divided by the total number okay total number of questions number of questions okay number of questions all right so we're just going to compute the sum first thing that we're going to carry out the division part alright so how many questions are answered correctly so let's find out that by that out so number answered correctly that's going to be on the sum of this column right here 17 plus 11 is it two at a time that's 28 and they add 20 to that and your son is going to be 48 so 48 to our asset correctly and then um the number of questions in all slows down a little bit so a number of questions number of questions um compute another some number questions is going to be C the sum of this column right here that's a lot of questions which is 20 plus 15 add that up that's 35 and then you add 25 to that and then you get 60 as your total number of questions okay so percent correct first of all as a fraction we're going to have a percent correct as a fraction it's going to be a total number answer correctly which is 48 scratch that out divided by total number of questions to the number of questions is 60 okay so if want to convert this a percentage this fraction to a percent we have to multiply it by 100 okay so that changes it into into percent okay so number answered correctly / - the noble question this tells you the fractional expression for the numbers of questions that were asked it correctly and if I multiply by 100 that converts your fraction into a percent okay so let's go ahead and simplify this so zero is counsel out our 2 goes into 6 three times allow let's just divide 6 into 48 so don't waste time on 6 goes here one six goes into 48 eight times and then 8 times 10 is 80 so 80 percent of the questions were answered correctly all right all right so let's take a look at number three says use the diagram below - and to the question that follows so we have a ruler here and then a little bridge so says in the actual enthalpy is 4200 feet then what is the skill of the diagram of the bridge all right so only thing in the series you have to be really really careful in dealing with units and also measurements okay because if you make the slightest assumption you might you might get the question wrong so you have to be really careful so some people might just look at this question as okay this is six right here so I'm just going to divide 6 by 4200 and get 700 and that's a trap that's a wrong answer you have to be really careful when you're reading units never make any assumptions okay so we look at this our ruler and the bridge you notice that the bridge starts from this projectile bridge the length of the bridge onto this ruler this is a starting part of the bridge and it starts at 1 and then where does it stand it goes as far as see this point right here to 6 so it goes from 1 to 6 so how many how long is that is 1 2 3 4 5 5 units okay so 5 units is equal to 4200 feet so we have to be really careful about 6 units so 5 units is equal to the length of the bridge which is 4200 then what is 1 unit is going to be well to get one unit from five I have to divide 5 by 5 right so divide this by 5 and to preserve a quality we divide that by 5 also okay so if you divide that out you have one unit equals now let's divide for a to 100 by five and use long division and just do that the top goes into the division symbol pile on here five doesn't go into four five goes in 42 8 times 8 times 5 is 40 subtract to bring down a 0 5 goes into 20 four times and in the lastly we just move it up 840 so one unit is 840 feet okay so when you're taking your series please pay close attention to the measurements okay you don't don't make any assumptions whatsoever and also the skills and the units all right all right so they have let's move on to the next question all right so says I which of the following is most appropriate for expressing the weight of a pencil so if we examine what we have here which of these units are used for measuring weights and all of them are used for measuring weight thought if we're looking at a solid object which one is not applicable pounds might sound fair pounds and ounces look good comes down to the good parts points times now this is really really heavy so that's not good find smaller less liquid quartz is liquid to now our pounds and ounces if we thinking about just one pencil okay one cancel do you think that which of these measurements is the best representation for one pencil sounds a little bit too big you know we have information like a box of pencils you know should be a large box of pencils opening these pounds but if we're just looking at one pencil we have to scale it down a little bit so ounces is basically the best choice aisle four for this option we have here okay all right so let's take a look at that question five it says a musketeer is needs to order a rope for a gym class 32 students each student will receive a piece of rope that is 5 feet 8 inches long what is the total length of rope music eteri needs to order for her class so what we're doing is basically multiplying a rope that's 5 feet and 8 inches long by a 32 okay so are we have 5 feet 8 inches x 32 now this is one mistake most people make most people just multiply 5 by 32 and get let's see what do you get 100 and not see 160 and I'll say is 160 feet and 8 inches you see the problem with that it's not just the feet that's being multiplied by 32 years ignore the inches so when you're doing a multiplying you have to make sure that this 32 is distributed to both measures the five feet and the 32 inches okay so please be careful when not doing conversion calculations so we have five times 32 and then we're going to add that to 8 times 32 okay so that's how I'm going to do it so let's do our multiplication 32 times 5 times 2 10 zero part 1 5 3 15 plus 1 6 16 so 160 feet and then for the inches we have 32 times 8 8 times 2 6 2 & 6 carry 1 8 times 3 is 24 plus 1 now that's going to be 25 so as 160 feet 256 inches all right okay let's look at a question that doesn't match anything you have there so what's the problem well 256 inches can be converted to feet and inches so how many people can we get out of this 56 inches remember you have 12 inches in one foot so I'll just have to do is we're going to divide 256 by 12 256 divided by 12 to take out the feet the foot out of the inches and then whatever the remainder is we're going to express that as the inches okay all right so 12 goes into 25 2 times because 2 times 12 is 24 subtract that one 6 12 goes into 16 once 1012 is 12 you try that and you left with 4 okay all right so um let's see this tells you that you're 21 inches and 4 feet and 256 inches okay so this is feet and this what do you have left is inches so what I'm going to do is I'm going to add the 21 so this Plus this is the same thing as 160 feet plus twenty-one feet four inches all right if I add the feet together I'll have 181 feet and four inches all right so don't forget to distribute your way x into the two units of measure so our final answer is option D all right let's move on to number six okay number six it says use a diagram a little to answer the question that falls what is the total length of the Clear Lake oh Claire links shoreline so you have to be really careful here to pay close attention to the question because it's shaded some people might want to start computing the area real quickly but it's asking us for the length of the lake so how long is it is it oh the Claire likes shoreline so the length of the shoreline okay so um bays and how the question looks like you might be tempted to start looking for the area because it's shaded but you have to be really careful to ask for the length of the shoreline okay so let's go ahead and find the length of the shoreline so we're just going to count the number units of the boundary that encloses the lake all right so let's start from here bottom right corner we have one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 okay so I just basically went around there like all the way around alright so after counting you might be in a haste to conclude that your answer is 22 miles and that will be the wrong answer okay so you have to be really careful when you deal with are the measurement section of the scene is that it can be really tricky sometimes okay if you notice you have five boxes here one two three four five being equivalent to ten miles so the five boxes equals ten miles what does that tell you that each box is so divided by five divided by five each box represents the sine length of each box presents a 1-mile I'm sorry represent two miles okay so that represents two miles so every one box is a least two miles okay all right so we counted 22 lines all around so the length of the car link is going to be 22 times the adjustment factor which is 222 times 2 which equals 44 miles all right so you might know how to do the question and you pretty good at math but just not ignoring the details can cause you to fall into a trap okay so you can consider the answer is option B all right let's take a look at question 7 so use the diagram below to answer the question that follows our last table top is supported by a rectangular a pedestal to the tabletop is 8 inches wider than the petals tool on each side what is the perimeter of the glass tabletop so we're looking for this parameter right here around the glass tabletop okay so it goes eight inches longer in all directions in all directions is 18 inches longer okay all right so um what we're going to do is write on the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle and then see what we can do here so the perimeter rectangle is basically two lengths plus to it all right so in this case what is the length cut dawg ah of the glass top the length of the glass top is the length of the pedestal which is 48 plus 1 plus the 8 units that's been uh added on both sides ok so what am I doing here let's say we want to call this this right here the link from here all the way to here okay unless you want to call that the length of the of the table top this is tell what is this what is this made up of is made up of the 48 from here to here is 48 right that's 48 but that's not all you need that 8 upstairs and a downstairs so 48 plus um the 8 on both and 16 okay so the length of my panel so I'm sorry my last tabletop is going to be 52 inches all right how about the width how wide is it well the width of my glass tabletop spans from the left to the right okay I know that it's going to be made up of multiple constituents um you have 36 on the center which is the length of the pedestal but you also have eight units here and another 18 it's there okay so the entire length of the the Android width this right here is a width okay we have L is already given by 52 so we need the width the width is going to be 36 the length of the Pettitte the width of the pedestal fuzzy 8 on both sides plus 16 also okay so that gives you 64 now to find the parameter now let's go back to our original formula we we were using provide a formula since we now have the length and the width of the glass tabletop is simply d double the length which is the left on the right sides this length Plus this length is 2w + u double the width which is the top and the bottom top and bottom um although something's wrong here oh let's see all right I interchange my results let me switch it around real quick so CG 48 plus 16 is 64 and then 36 plus 16 is 52 okay excellent all right so I'll just double the length and then double the width and then that will basically give us what the parameter is okay so you multiply this by 2 our this is superb because we can switch the order around it multiply this by 2 you get 104 that's W the width and if you double the length which is the left on the right side 2 times 64 that's 128 and then we add it together 104 plus 128 you get two hundred and thirty-two inches as your final answer okay so answer for question seven is e all right sorry about the mix-up there let's go on to question number eight all right says but our abuse is one box for every five days to feed his cats approximately how many boxes of cat food does he use from what all right so on this one is good to set up a lung cancer per hour proportion um but you want to be consistent with your units okay so let's say that you want to set it up as follows you have you want to call the numerator boxes okay and then you want to call it and denominator you know called the denominator things all right so you have one box for five days okay at the first fraction and then next it says approximately how many boxes so let's call that X so X is the number of boxes that we do not know / wait a minute per month per month how many days are there in a month between 30 and 31 right so we can put one month here because the unit has already been said today so we must convert one month in today's so one month is around the same 30 you know so let's just earn it alright so we have this ratio set up these are the bottom our boxes on the top now to get X by itself what do you do simply multiply both sides by 30 this is up proportionately half set up right here multiply both sides like 32 thirties council out and then you have um 30 over 5 equals x and if you divide 30 by 5 what do you get 30 over 5 is 6 okay so it's roughly 6 days I mean yeah six hour boxes so answer is option letter d okay let's move on to the next question question 9 all right so it says time can develop two rolls of film in about 18 minutes at work at this rate how long will it take her to do of egg rolls of film so this is similar to the kind of question we did before want to set up a proportion let's see number of rolls for the numerator and then time time in minutes you have to be careful the unit's okay as a denominator okay so have two rolls per 18 minutes okay and then last this is how long will it take you to develop eight rules or eight rolls in X minutes because I don't know what it is alright alright so to solve this sound we can cross multiply if we cross multiply to solve this expression well there two ways you can do this you can do this by inspection you notice that I multiply the numerator by 4 to get from 2 to 8 so you can do the same at the bottom multiply this by 4 which is 17 2 minutes which comes out to an hour and 12 minutes or I can do a lot of really okay suppose we deliberately assuming that we're not we don't want to use a shortcut so to do it algebraically I'll press multiply I have 2x equals 80 plus 64 144 and then I divide both sides by 2 and then I get x equals 72 minutes all right so let's convert that to hours and minutes because we do not have we have it Express two thousand minutes here and this is not an option so we we know that there's an hour an hour 60 minutes so if we subtract one full hour from that which is 60 minutes we're going to be left with 12 minutes all right so our solution is going to be one hour because we subtracted just one six set of 60 minutes from our solution and we're left with 12 minutes alright so there's going to be one hour and 12 minutes so your answer is option B okay so if you can solve it by inspection go ahead but it's a little bit more complicated like a decimal something like that and candid mentally is use the algebraic processes to help like here on problem solving process easier okay all right so let's take a look at approaching terraces statistics openal probability here says Lilliana has the value models the bag contains 18 black red eleven blue and eight white lily either anima takes a red marble from the bag and leaves the marble on the table so there's no placement here what is the probability that you'll next cigarette or a white marble from the bag so anytime you see or that's on tells you an operation in statistics and the operation for or is in this condition we see nd multiply okay so the question is what is probability of red + or probability of white okay alright so you know that the probability of an event basically is a desired outcomes besides versus the total all right that's a probability formula so I'm going to do this two independently and then we're going to add up our answers okay so probability of red we use the total number red divided by the total number of models that they are so how many words they are are there remember he took one out and there were fifteen before so we're left with 14 okay so what is the total number of marbles total models total marbles how do we do that well just add a number of moles we have okay so we have read this 14 ah why is 14 because she only took one out okay so 14 plus 11 that's 25 and then let's add an 825 Plus 8 that's um that's all these three carry 133 and let's not forget the 18 black marbles plus 18 1-3 151 models and also probability of red is 14 divided by 51 okay because that's a total because we did in fact that one has a really cool model hasn't taken out or how about probability of Y how many whites are there there are eight white marbles and how many total 51 okay so probability of probability of red or white here a red or a P of W this means that we sum this individual probabilities to is 14 over 51 plus 8 over 51 okay and then your final answer is going to be 22 over 51 answer is option letter B okay so there you have it but thanks so much for taking the

guys yes I shouldn't talk about dilution calculation pathway what is dilution that oh she means are more solvent is added and the solute remains the same as a result because solute to remain same and more cemente add it so the water of solution gets more so that's why the concentration of the solution becomes wrong right how do we say the concentration the concentration C you call the amount of solute divided amount of solution by a multi hundred percent right when this one you add most event the solute solution equals the solution you cause solute press so met when at the most event so root to stay sane so the solution the volume of solution gets more but salutis to stay sane so in this situation this is the fraction when numerator stays stay same and the denominator gets greater so the fraction gets smaller so that's why the concentration gets smaller so let's look at example and question one using a dilution procedure looking for how many milliliters of 15% master volume sodium chloride solution I needed to make 1,500 milliliter of 0.9% sodium chloride solution so when you do a question about the dilution you always make clear solute doesn't change so we're looking for how many solute so because the amount of solute in both solution 1 is concentrated solution the other is diluted solution stay safe so let's look at this one how many milliliter 50% of this well I needed to make 1,500 middle of 0.9% solution so from 15% to 0.9% the solution is diluted so 0.9% is 0.9% means there are zero point nine grams of solute in 100 milliliters of solution right that's percent because zero point nine over 100 zero point nine grams solute over 100 milliliter of source now we make 1,500 milliliters solution that's why we can set the ratio zero point nine grams over hundred milliliter equals we need fifteen hundred million so this is a how many how much salute so we can find X equals because both side we can zero cancel zero cancel so X multiplier one you called fifteen one five zero point nine we got fifteen times 0.9 the unit because we're looking for X when milliliter middle either cancel out the answer will be got their grams so 15 times this is the X cat is a one point five times nine is thirteen point five grams so we need the thirteen point five we have thirteen point five grams of salt and the 13.5 thirteen point five grams of solute it from concentrated so then we write the solution that's why we looking for the volume from fifteen percent we can say fifteen percent means 15 grams in each unit either this is a high concentration this is the low concentration so 15 grams in hundred milliliter now we have we needed 13 point 5 gram is how many milliliters solution right so in this situation first you need focus on how many how much solute after find the number of solute because solute stay say so then you go to the console how how many you need so in this situation we can calculate x equals you cross multiply she cross multiplication and then x times 15 and 15 on the bottom and 100 times thirteen point five which is 13.5 multiply hungry right then we got x equals the top is one three five zero divided the 15 then we can use calculate to find the answer so during the calculation every time you need the folks on the solute it doesn't change right so we have 1350 divided the 15 you call it 90 so this is a 90 minute even because this one is grams gram cancel out so actually call me really so X because ninety milliliters so we need 90 million liters of 15 percent and the sodium chloride the solution and to make a fifteen hundred milliliter of 0.9% solution this is the question one question to how much cement in milliliters should be added to five milliliters of a 50.0 milligram per milliliter antibiotic solution to decrease the concentration to one percent this question is looking for so vent because cement press the root because solution in dilution situation so rule to never change just add more cement so that's why we still for are looking for how much salute now the information they say how much cement in the region should be added to five milliliter of 50 milligrams per milliliter antibiotic solution let's make a picture this one because in for example in a graduated major and you have I say you have five milliliter this is a five million five milliliter solution which is 50 milligram per minute this is a 50 milligram per milliliter concentration right this way and now we need to decrease the concentration to one percent so that means you need to add them most select so at the most event becomes two less concentration right become a less concentration now this is still five this is still five maybe leader this is right and this way the final volume solution we don't know we're looking for and then the solute is stained saying so that's why we need a first using these two information to find the number of solute so the number of solute is we can say 55 milliliter multiplied 50 milligrams per milliliter so we have milliliter middle it'll cancel out with 250 milligrams absolute so this is inside is 250 meter 250 milligrams of solute and even after dilute I rotate still 250 milligrams but distribute in more select so now you can say the final concentration because you still have 250 milligrams but you have more so when you have more volume of solution and become the Constituent become one percent the one percent means one gram in 100 milliliter so now you can see how much this one we don't know so this is the X right it's an X leader todos Russia and the solute is tasting so it 250 milligrams so you can write X milliliter to 50 milligram but the milligrams and the grams is not matching unit so we need convert the same unit from grams to milligrams but I solid so one grams you can't win solvent milligrams so then you can see we're working with these two this part what sorry this one should be when gram to install the meter when the ball you stay 100 right 400 see 100 and this is a 250 we're looking for so then you can see these two zero zero kinds of out right then we look at the dis one obviously cross multiplication we can say the milligrams is x equals you cross my 3k Sheen you got 250 and what PI 1 you cause 100 we got the 25 made it easy so this is 25 this is X you call 25 milliliter the final solution is 25 minute ago so we're looking for servant obvious you can see before you have 5 milliliter now you need the 25 milliliter so the solution servant equals so so when T equals 25 minus 5 and this is a milliliter you call tiny milliliter this one is the milliliters of cement okay this is presented by y sky thank you", "4uQtJDf7drU": "How many cups are in\n3 and 1/2 gallons? So before even addressing this\nquestion, let's just think about how large a cup is. Actually, I'll give you a little\nbit of overview of how many cups there are in a pint,\nhow many pints in a quart, and how many quarts in a gallon. Let me just draw a cube here,\nand let's imagine that this is a gallon. The most common time we see\na gallon is when you see a gallon of milk. So let's say that that whole\nthing is a gallon. You can imagine if it had a\nhandle, it would be kind of a big gallon of milk. Now, there are 4 quarts\nper gallon. Let me write this over here. There are 4 quarts per gallon. So if I were to draw the quarts\nhere, I could divide this gallon into 4 quarts, and\nthen each of these sections would be a quart. So you would have 4 quarts. So this right here that I've\njust drawn in blue would be exactly 1 quart. And obviously, there's 4 of them\nin this entire gallon. Now, you can divide the\nquarts into pints. You have 2 pints per quart. So this quart that I drew here,\nI can divide it into 2, like that, and this little\nsection that I'm highlighting in magenta is a pint. That is a pint right\nover there. And then finally, there\nare 2 cups per pint. So this pint right here, I can\ndivide it into 2, and each of these will be a cup. So this section right\nhere will be a cup. Now, we can go straight and\nfigure out exactly how many cups there are per gallon. Actually, that might be\nan interesting way to think about it. If you have 4 quarts-- let's\nmultiply it right here. So you have 4 quarts per gallon times 2 pints per quart. What does this give you? This gives you 4 times\n2 is equal to 8. And then the quarts cancel\nout, and you have 8 pints per gallon. And that makes complete sense\nbecause we had 4 quarts in this gallon, and then\neach of those quarts have 2 pints in them. So 4 times 2. So 8 pints per gallon. And then we can multiply that\ntimes 2 cups per pint. So I could just copy and\npaste this right here. Actually, I should've\ncut and paste. Let me select it again. I want to do that so I get\nthat real estate back. So edit, cut, edit, paste. There you go. So now you multiply this\ntimes 2 cups per pint. And the reason why this will\nwork is because you have pints in the numerator. It cancels out with the pints\nin the denominator. And you will be left with-- I'll\ngo back to the yellow-- 8 times 2 is 16. In the numerator, we have\ncups per gallon. Now, we just figured how many\ncups there are per gallon. That makes sense. This section right here is\nexactly 1/16 of this entire cube, this entire gallon. But we haven't even answered\nour question. We want to figure out how\nmany cups there are in 3 and 1/2 gallons. So let's write it over here. So we're concerned with\n3 and 1/2 gallons. I don't like working\nwith mixed numbers. I like to turn them into\nimproper fractions. 3 and 1/2 is the same thing as\n2 times 3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. This is the same thing as 7/2. If you divided 7 by 2, you would\nget 3 with a remainder of 1, or this would be\n3 and 1/2, so this is the exact same thing. So we want to know how many\ncups are in 7/2 gallons. So what we want to do is end up\nwith cups, and we want the gallons to cancel out. So we have gallons in the\nnumerator right here. It's definitely not in\nthe denominator. And so we want to divide\nby gallons. And then we're going to\nhave a numerator. We have cups in the numerator. And how many cups are\nthere per gallon? Well, we just figured\nthat out. There are 16 cups per gallon. When you multiply these two\nquantities, the gallons will cancel out, and you'll just be\nleft with cups, and that's what we wanted. So it's going to be\n7/2 times 16. So this is going to be\n7 times 16/2 cups. You could divide 16\nby 2 to get 8. 2 divided by 2 is 1. So it just becomes 7 times 8\ndivided by 1, or just 7 times 8, which is 56. So this is equal to 56 cups. And this should make sense. This should be a much larger\nnumber because cups are a much smaller unit. So if you have 3 and 1/2\ngallons, you will have many, many, many more cups in that\n3 and 1/2 gallons, so this makes sense.", "ov1U7KURPus": "[Music] we're back on another day for this two-part video this is part two of my custom pipe shelf if you haven't seen video one I had a lot of fun making it go check it out something like this is affordable fun to make and if you love your pipes and you love your tobacco and storing them you'll love to make this so let's get started with this video alright guys well I've done here is I've laid out my shelves on this hard board and then this marked it out with a sharpie and I'm gonna be cutting on that line all the way and that will be the backing of that alright guys I just got a cut out right there and that's some excess of it I use a utility knife to do my pre markings and you have to keep really straight in and that you can go light and go over a couple times and I would suggest that first before going full blast because I went full blast into it and my line started to end up more like s's instead of straight lines and what I'd like to use on this would be like a table saw or a dremel tool with a cutter bit just to go over it and that would that would have worked great but from for what I have I ended up having you know almost perfect cuts all the way across I'm gonna have to sand it down of course and maybe you know trim it up a little bit but I'm just glad that everything lined up perfectly because I only have one piece and I didn't want to go back to the store so hey guys I got her old sand paper down and drilled in the back side anyways two bolts up there and two bolts down there and those are wider than these two and I'll tell you why I decided after I did these two to make them wide because I'm not putting bolts on the side I'm actually going to superglue the side because this is so thin that it this side will hold and there's not much give right now as it is so I think whether the super cool glue holds it or not it should be fine yeah that's how I decided to do it and that's what it looks like with the back now it's time to polish her up sandpaper down and make it look pretty alright guys what I decided to do in this clip is used a butane torch lighter to put in the wood and give it a nice rustic feel before I go ahead and stain it this choice is really up to you guys just keep it even if you decide to do it and don't know if we do it unless you want it to look like a can of motor oil right now as my shelf hanging and this wire is what's holding it up along with this drywall screws so this drywall screw is a screw that holds it in with drywall it's pretty self-explanatory I put a 5/16 drill bit through the wall came back with it nice and even hole straight in flat and then I put the drywall anchor in use a tool to prop it open and actually opened up like that and caught the drywall so it can't pull out this way and it's actually ready for like a hundred and thirty-five pounds okay so this is some wiring here and I'll put the gauge on screen right now and I've took 8 of those pieces and cut them evenly right and then I spindle them together you don't know what spin Ling is you're in the same boat as I was I looked up a YouTube video and I put that video in the description on explaining how to spindle your wire with a drill and some needle nose pliers or I think you might have used a vise or some some sort of holding method I know this might be a little overwhelming but stop staring at all the pipes and all the other crap on it and focus on the rest occation for a sec so this is what it looks like when I burned it I burnt it here here here you know basically all over the place and random places and even on most of this this shelf right here and even on the side right here so it gave it a really good feel I believe and I like how it turned out you don't have to burn it it's your shelf you do whatever you want I did that I put I stained it with expresso color color of stain that is called expresso you can use whatever color you want let it dry two hours put on the backing then I'll let it set for three days I believe before I got busy and with my other stuff and I let it set for like three or four days in my Grod remember in warmer climates is going to dry a lot easier and colder climates like I'm in Colorado right now and this took a while to stop stinking so that's what it looks like once it's fully Donna how this small shelf down here that just has enough space to hold let's see this is probably like a 1.75 out of 10 this is a couple 176 ounce 10 this actually this has to be bigger this is like a to understand this like the 1.7 610 I'm mister bra glider almost everytime it lights which is really nice if you are looking at pipe lighters for a soft flame that's a good lighter even has some some pipe tool built into it like that so you don't have to carry two separate pieces my butane lighter my rustic matches I got off of Amazon have a 10 I'm storm in here and then this Mississippi Seattle pipe club and this is actually the special reserve edition blah blah blah got my pipes up there that I like that fit perfectly on this and do not hang very nicely this one actually hangs really nicely and so does this one but if they sit better right there my battery pack which actually has a button to change lighting on it so that's a annoying so I'm just going to keep it like that this is a pipe that I'm storing in the box because I don't want it touching the water and now it's just a helper 10 with some setliffe in it I'm not even sure what flavor so I'm not going to get into it on thumb imported briar Italian small boy pipe a small boy pipe some prior works from corncob that's actually empty and just Foresta kated looks I put it up there probably won't keep it long and then this is my shelf and each hole I have nine holes up here 9 grooves right there so I could a total of 18 pipes if my math is correct and so yeah I have a shelf there I have a shelf there my line of pipes there you can actually put stuff up there like that outpoint can and some maybe a PI tool or whatever you want on the backing up here and then I have another little shelf that's the middle of it then I have another little shelf there not really by using as a shelf on that I mean - I get pipes and then all my pipes hang right there with those holes up there and I'll send it down neatly and then I have a backing right there on the top so that's what it looks like all finished so this is gonna be a video for the last date I'll explain what that is in the next video so stay tuned for that so I had a lot of fun making this shelf and I saved tons of money doing it instead of buying one it looked great and if you're asking is a little bowtie right there because that middle shelf I should have just ended it down like a half of inch and it would have been completely straight but just bowed out just a bit not that much I'd say about that but it gives an authentic vibe because I I built this myself I'm pretty happy with it and how it turned out and I'm going to cherish this for years to come I'm like always guys take it easy enjoy your guys's pipes and drive your guys's weekend your whiskey whatever you're doing and hit me up with the like and I subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next one for that video right there peace [Music]", "rP0zdizTLHs": "hi um I'm like salad if they have like like spring mix or something spring mix I mean whatever kind of like yeah that one's okay yeah and the potatoes doesn't really matter what kind either all right thank you bye hi guys so today's video is gonna be really short I actually last week or the week before I made some vegan rice krispies treats it was my first time making vegan righteous rice I can't even say vegan rice krispies treats it's my first time making them and a couple people asked for like a more detailed recipe like I posted in my Instagram story and I also posted on my feed but people still had questions and I felt like this recipe was a little bit too casual to like write up in a blog post I feel like I'm not really good at writing recipes anyway I just kind of put up the general guidelines and then I'm just like okay just go from there just do what you want so like I said this is gonna be super casual like I don't I'm not gonna make a full-blown recipe video I'm probably just gonna insert my Instagram stories here as a visual aid like I don't know if you can tell that I didn't even make the bed behind me like that's how casual we're gonna be today so I loosely based this on a recipe from more cooks which I will insert in the description below but I basically have to her recipe because she's two bags of dandies and I really only wanted to buy one plus I was just making it for myself like I'm here on quarantine like by myself I didn't need a huge batch of rice krispies treats so for those who don't know like regular store-bought marshmallows are not typically vegan because they contain gelatin the brand of vegan marshmallows that I've been using for a few years now is called dandies but recently Trader Joe's came out with their own kind of vegan marshmallows but I think you might only see them seasonally like around Christmastime dandies you can definitely get at Whole Foods and I ordered mine from thrive market okay so here's what you do you get a saucepan and you melt about 1/4 cup of vegan butter I was using Earth Balance this day actually when I have her recipe it would have been a quarter plus 1/2 1/4 plus 1/8 1/4 plus 1/8 you don't really need to pay attention to this part but I just I think in my recipe I used a little bit too much butter so you might want to use a quarter cup of butter and then one 10 ounce pack of Danny's vegan marshmallows so after your butter is melted just toss your marshmallows in and this is where I kind of started to panic because my marshmallows weren't melting they weren't really doing anything they were just kind of staying in their original form and now they're covered in butter but the original recipe said to melt the butter turn off the heat then do your marshmallows and expect them to melt and that wasn't really working for me so I turned my pan back on to low heat and just kept stirring continuously and I feel like it probably took I don't know maybe like three minutes maybe a little bit longer and they didn't melt per se but they kind of turned into like a blob so that's what you want you want a big blob of melty marshmallows so then when I came to adding the cereal half of her recipe would have been 4 cups but I didn't really feel like measuring it I knew my cereal box had eight cups of cereal so I just kind of eyeballed it I just kept pouring stuff in and stirring it basically until you get to the point where the cereal pieces are starting to fall off a little bit because you want everything held together so when it starts to get like just slightly crumbly I don't know if that's the right way to describe it but basically where if you start adding more cereal you know it's gonna start falling off that's when you stop adding cereal so then I just got a cookie sheet and lined it with parchment paper I put a little bit of melted butter down on the parchment and then I took my blob of cereal marshmallows out and put them on the pan I just use my hands at this point I originally thought I was gonna need a rolling pin but that's too excessive like you definitely don't need that just use your hands push it down into like a flat you know whatever thickness you want your rice krispies treats and then you want to let it sit for like I don't know the instruction set an hour but I feel like I went back to it sooner than that just use your own judgement and another thing that I thought I did wrong but was actually a okay I thought I wanted to use these Mickey Mouse cookie cutters and really I could only make two mickey shapes based on the way I had my loaf laid out but the thing is still pretty malleable like after it cools so you can you know use the cookie cut if you want to use cookie cutters of course you could just cut it into like squares or bars or whatever but if you want to use cookie cutters you can cut out kind of as many shapes as you can with your original thing and then blob it back up and like press it back down and start over again and then the last one I didn't have enough left to like actually shape it into a square that was big enough to use the cookie cutter but that was fine because I just set the cookie cutter down placed the cereal goo inside of it pressed it down into the shape and that was good enough like it made another one and I think I made six total so yeah if you end up with cereal leftover just mush it into your cookie cutter you don't have to actually cut it out last thing that I want to mention and that you should be aware of if you're trying to make vegan rice krispies treats is that a lot of rice krispies treats and I guess cereal in general is not technically vegan because it has vitamin D let me look it up so I don't tell you the wrong thing okay I got it so regular Rice Krispies contain vitamin d3 which traditionally comes from lanolin like when you see that in mainstream like fortified cereals and mainstream vitamins it's gonna be coming from lanolin which is like the grease from sheep's wool it was just a little weird based on this post that I'm reading which is from your vegan journey calm and I'll also link this below it sounds like pretty much if you see d3 in something and it's not clearly labeled to vegan then it's probably not vegan so like I take a vitamin d3 supplement but it says on the label vegan and vegan d3 comes from like in but they're not really using like in base d3 in like mainstream items yet unless it's labeled vegan I feel like that took a little longer to explain that I thought it would but I will link the blog post like I said and the blog post also includes a few brand names of companies that make vegan rice krispies so if you want to make these rice krispies treats and you want to know what kind of cereal to buy that will help you out the brand that I used is called 1\u00b0 foods um I also got this from thrive market and I use chocolate ones just because that's what they had in stock at the time I probably would prefer just the plain ones I feel like that has more of a classic like Rice Krispies treat taste but the chocolate ones were still really good I think that's pretty much it that's all you need to know go forth and make your rice krispies treats and I will see you in the next video [Music]", "6EwnDkT2GDQ": "sometimes that little bit of added flash makes all the difference in the world let's go pull up in a calm pocket I'm gonna talk to you guys about some options with under spins hey guys Matt Allen here welcome back to tactical Bassin today we are going to talk about making your own under spins how to do it on the fly out here on the boat so that you can adapt and change with the conditions and keep catching fish it's very easy to do if you're prepared now you guys know that we love under spins we talk about them a lot we we throw exposed tooks we throw weedless versions there are some great heads on the market and we try to always have them around especially in the fall but it's never going to fail you're out there on a bite in fact it happened to me yesterday where you think you've got what you need conditions change and even though you own a ton of tackle you find yourself out on the boat with that tackle at home and you're not prepared so today I'm going to walk you through just a handful of things that are gonna make a huge difference for you most of us carry a hook box in the boat if you're a bank guy you probably carry some hooks too just not quite the selection well today we're gonna go through just a handful of things here that are going to change things for you they're not heavy they don't take up a lot of space you can add them to your box and when conditions start changing you're right there with them so under spins what is it just in case you guys have missed that an under spin it's going to be a head that's got a blade hanging down below it you're gonna pair it up with a swimbait and when you swim that thing through the water you've got that swim bait back there kicking you've also got that blade churning underneath think of it as a very finesse approach to spinnerbait fishing that's basically what it is a little tiny blade just adding some flash adding some vibration to a swimbait they range in size their giant under spins tiny under spins but when you get out there on the lake and it starts changing on you you can adapt so here's a couple of things I want to talk to you about these two guys are gonna make a world of difference for you two different styles of blades that you can add this little Pro Point guy it's a blade with a screw to go into a bait this one con baits these are made to hang so the difference you know let's just build one I'm gonna start with this guy right here some Matt Allen swim bait head obviously a head that I throw a lot but occasionally when I'm out here on the water especially if I get around a lot of bait fish I need to add some flash to it if I've got these guys in the boat I'm good to go I just keep both tied on but I don't always have them with me and more importantly this is a 3/8 ounce so is this look at the difference in the hook size this is a much styler hook and it's a size larger one of the things I like about my head is that the hooks are up size just a little not enough to create a problem when you're trying to finesse it and use lighter line but they're a little stouter than the under spins that are on the market the benefit to me is that when I get around big fish I can do exactly what we're gonna do right here and I end up with a little bit stronger hook so I don't ever come out prepared for that per se I start out with just my swim bait head and just an under spin but if I start catching giants on that under spin what I do is I take this head I grab that probe point blade and next we're gonna talk wheatless what I do is I line this guy up I look at the belly of the bait and I look at that Pro point because once it's screwed in everything needs to be straight so I line it up I pick my location I just sort of stab it in there and then you're just going to twist it's a screw lock it's gonna go right into that material and literally that fast I'm running an under spin and they work so well so well it's that easy you don't have to carry a ton of stuff on the boat now let's talk weedless there's a bunch of different reasons to do this it could be as simple as here's an owner flashy swimmer it's a 5 watt flashy swimmer this is the owner be stuck it's a 4 OTT Beast the Beast has a slightly deeper throat a lot of the time it doesn't matter some days I get a way better hook up ratio here than here it seems to make a difference on those days this guy the con baits they make a version of it that's weightless you take that weightless version snap it onto the beast hook and now I've got that better hook up ratio and I'm right back where I started but I'm hooking more fish some days it doesn't matter I mean we love the flashy swimmer we throw it a ton but once in a while you're like why today why do they not want to fully eat it today and that beast hook is still getting them so let's look at a couple more examples well here is the con baits out of the package all you're gonna need to carry guys let's run through the components and then we're gonna rig this to those little pro point blades these little conveyed blades some owner CPS Springs you throw that into your hook box you can adapt to any condition any condition I mean that so here a couple more examples here's one that's still rigged out on the water you don't have any components you don't have an under spin to save your life you don't even have a wide gap hook no problem you see how good that looks that thing has been catching fish it's a flipping hook it is a straight up flipping hook take a flipping hook take that spring clip it to the eyelet so that you can screw your bait on this is a four point eight Kai Tak going on a five off flip and hook stab that guy in there and then that con baits all you do is clip it on and you've got a perfect understand made out of flipping components now that's where that spring is going to make a big difference if you've got wide gap hooks you don't even have to do that so here we go there's one of those Scottsboro swim baits we told you we're starting to experiment with six OTT Gamakatsu wide gap hook see if we can do this middle of the nose pop it out just like it's a just like it's a worm come around hmm you know what I don't think I like that hook we're going bigger bigger owner jungle gap jungle wide gap six awe hug same spot plop it out I like that one better come back here pop through a reason why I said I didn't like cuz I didn't have enough hook gap when they ate it I wasn't going to expose that hook now I will okay now we're a weedless swim bait but we're still weightless we don't have a blade take that con this is the 3/8 put that guy in here clip clip we are in business and you can do it with any of these baits here's a 5.8 high tech now they make big owner swim bait hooks to do a lot of this stuff but again if you have to stock all that stuff on the boat it's a mess it's it it's a whole extra box in your boat let alone if you're walking the shoreline use that same hook that's that jungle hook it's gonna look good on this five point eight spin that guy around Saima let's use that eight balance little eight down sky why would we use a little eight doubts because we're fish in shallow water fishing around docks fishing around grass you don't wanna get snagged in that grass and just like that you're in business why would you not stock this stuff it is so easy guys it allows you to use different gap hooks different strength hooks different weights you can use a stronger hook than you can find in your favorite underspin so many different things and it's just a handful of little parts that you throw into your box and it's done and you can see how fast this is going it's not like it's complicated to make these under spins you can do it with any hook any hook can be adapted and turned in to an under spin in a flash when you get around bait when those fish are just getting a little funny your bite doesn't seem to be as good as it was quick adaptation make the switch get back to catching fish guys I hope you enjoyed this video I hope it helps you it's easy to do it's easy to just stick in a little compartment forget about it bury it in the boat but when the day comes that you need to adapt you thought your fish were out deep they moved up shallow all of a sudden you don't have a weedless under spin or you thought you were fishing grass and the fish backed out now you can't reach them you need to get heavier so many different times where quick changes make the difference if you enjoyed this video hit that like button subscribe to the channel turn on those notifications so you know when you get a video Monday Wednesday Friday we put new videos out and the occasional Tuesday or Thursday we appreciate you guys we'll talk to you soon [Music] you you", "SCqIwyRMsvo": "hey guys so we're doing something a little different today um that being we are going to brew a beer down at the creek at the end of my property and we're gonna do it over fire with Creek water and it's probably gonna be a real weird and we're also gonna ferment it down at the creek in a Courtney keg so everything's pretty much been hiked down already I'm just bringing a lot of beer in the ingredients and yeah we're gonna do this crazy thing I don't know how it work honestly I got to go back to LA really soon so you know you have to do one big bang thing before you leave so I'll show you guys the path down to the creek [Music] so one of the fun things we're gonna do for this beer is we're actually going to use the water from this year-long running stream on our property and so basically the reason people tell you not to drink out of streams is because there's bacteria in it that you want to boil off before you drink it so obviously beer works really well for that hence why people used to drink beer as water when the water wasn't safe so we're gonna grab six gallons of water from this Creek and start to heat up for our mash so we've got our Creek water in our kettle and we are going to stick it right on the fire to get it up to strike temperature which is one hundred and fifty seven degrees and then pull it off mash in do the whole mash just kind of where it is now and then we're going to lay some rebar um and basically bring it up to boil and boil it on the rebar on the fire over the coals so we're just sticking it right on top of these logs okay it's not gonna collect [Music] okay so this is now at 157 which is our strike temperature we're gonna do another 150 to mash temp so we've got nine pounds of zero one pound of white wheat and 4 ounces of caramel 60 that's going to go in this we're gonna just have to have a really simple IPA today with a bunch of mosaic and cascade our cascade is actually hemp infused so I thought it was a little appropriate that we do backyard backwoods brew with some hemp cascade very close oh we're way beyond there we need to add a little bit of water there's so much soot in this yeah okay so we are at 157 exactly so got some relatively dirty water here from the creek but I'm concerned I have a strong feeling that it will all settle out with the troop during fermentation so whatever it's gonna get boiled anyway so why would we worry about Giardia or anything okay so we have 9 pounds of zero one pound of white wheat and 4 ounces of caramel 60 to make our IPA and we're gonna mention this is gonna be a 45-minute mash just because you know we're in the woods so it's not like we have the comforts of home here except we do have a massive cooler of beer so we are gonna do be just fine [Music] so our strike temp was 157 we're hoping for a mash temp of 152 and we've got just around 6 gallons for this a little over 6 gallons because we're gonna make a four gallon batch we're going to ferment this in a Courtney keg so you can't go all the way up to a five-gallon or you know you're gonna explode it everywhere and you know we're leaving it down here so it's not like we're gonna be able to have an eye on it all the time so we're gonna come down check it about once a day there's a very steep hill to get down here so you know the less you can check it the better and the less paranoid you can be about it the better so we are at 151 I'm gonna take that and cover it and call it a day all right so we're gonna set timer for 45 minutes and meet you back here to mash out and root beer so we've made a good ghillie suit for our mash tun to help insulate it I usually don't insulate this one at all so I don't know our temperature might actually drop less than it usually does when we're up at the house so it's been 45 minutes and we're gonna pull our malt now so we're just gonna use a log we found in the forest to wrap it all up and we're gonna do the same squeeze thing that we have been doing forever so whatever hopefully this kind of maintained a consistent temperature we're gonna see if the moss actually helps weird to have moss that's not Irish moss in your beer perfect this is gonna be a challenge getting it off without getting lost all over what is beautiful Thank You Cindy okay where all righty it fits it ships no there's so much dirt it's just the end that's dirty right actually we can probably roll it there if you think I don't know you told me I got yelled at it's really hard to hold yeah right well I'm trying not to lose a bunch of [ __ ] I think we can just scooch if you can that's that's pretty good it is nice to have this much grip though and not like be rectangular yeah this is a very dynamic uh you know we're we're doing the Ergo dynamic uh malts uh squeeze so this is really hot oh I didn't even check what temperature was so it looks like the moss did not help us I mean you live and you learn it is cool we drop down to less than 140 somehow which doesn't seem right but you know I'mI'm taking the temperature a little late in the game so whatever so we need about five all right where are we so we're at we've already got five and a half out of this already so I mean this is probably gonna boil a lot alder flavored a hemp infused beer very natural oh no that's what we should call it all-natural okay you want to hold it up and twist it around [Music] and you know what I would do is just hang this somewhere flop it and track it Cindy's boss if we defer the bad god that's hot yep look at my hands hey brewmaster that's a hot beer there it is I know it hurts that's more beer though we should have brought clean gloves she's like I don't want to strain this out when I'm trying to make dog biscuit we should hang this up somewhere so it'll dry so we've got just less than six gallons somehow which is [ __ ] crazy I'm gonna take my pre-boil gravity reading so our pre-boil volume was not supposed to be this high I don't know if my calculators are gonna work out here because they're web-based um so our pre-boil volume was supposed to be four point eight three gallons instead of six so we have a lot to boil off yeah and our pre boil of gravity was supposed to be 1.0 five nine and we're we're low um so we are at around twelve and a half it doesn't want to work because I'm offline okay so you know what we're gonna do we're just gonna try to trust the specific gravity that's in the refractometer which means we're at 1.05 so we only have 0.009 to go to hit our original gravity and we've got a [ __ ] gallon more than we actually need so this actually might end up being one of those super heavy hitting biers again what are we doing you know it's that squeeze method that really does it I think okay so we're gonna throw this on the fire we've got our rebar set up over some coals and yeah should boil really quickly honestly it didn't take much time at all to get this up to mash temp put down your beer already perfect you know for dropping that low it was a pretty good original pre-boil gravity yeah we're at 140 so the only thing I'm actually worried about is getting a lot of smoke in this beer but we're doing it over coals right now so it doesn't seem like that'll really be a problem but you know we're just gonna have to kind of figure that out as we go and hopefully this boils quickly who knows so we are now hot breaking so we've got to wait a half an hour to add our first hop addition which is mosaic and I believe it's one ounce so yeah I we've got a lot of work to boil up still it looks like we're probably about five and a half gallons right now but you know it took almost no time to get to boiling so I think it's going to boil pretty damn well and I mean it looks like we've got an uneven boil going because there's more fire on the left-hand side your left hand side then mine but yeah we might explode who knows oh man we got we it's we got to be be careful here well I think it's gonna be good as long as it check that that that one piece out of there get some gloves ready - that'll help a lot it looks like it already instantly help there yeah I'm just not good you're good that made a big difference okay so we are gonna add in or one ounce of mosaic we're at the 30-minute mark and then our next one is at the 20 minute mark so Northwest hop farm sent me this hemp infused cascade and they also sent me some of the egg that I'm using so super stiff to try this super green all right green hahaha alright so I'm just throwing this in my hot bag like always except it's connected to other things right now so it's gonna be a pain in the ass alright it's in there okie dokie so I'm gonna set the timer for 25 minutes and meet you guys back here so it's our five minute edition we're doing two ounces of each the hemp infused cascade and the mosaic from Northwest hop farms out of British Columbia which I know a lot of my viewers are actually from which is rad I got to make it up there one time we're also gonna throw in our world flock and some nice nutrient and I'm gonna throw the were flock just in the boil so it's utilized well and then the hops in the bag and the yeast nutrient also just kind of in there just a sprinkle laughs of course this got twisted make my life harder there we go okay so this is our last hop addition and we should actually throw the chiller in it as well so we can sanitize it all up before we want to start chilling we're going to use a drill pump to actually pump some of the creek water through the I'm getting smoked out uh my rabbit White Rabbit White Rabbit um so we're gonna use the drill pump to pump water from the creek through the immersion chiller downfall of doing the forest okay so we're throwing that in and I'm trying not to get my face in the smoke again okay so our boil is up and we are going to just rest it in the river and then use our drill pump to pump Creek water through it and chill it as fast as we can [Music] that's deep hole I think it might be too deep it's perfect yeah careful with your hands okay perfect ish what we're gonna do is hook up what's called a drill pump which is basically a pump that's run by your like drill obviously and we're gonna push the creek water through the immersion chiller to chill this beer down as quick as we can with it now tells your rope nice oh it's warm I would hope so so our bricks turned out to be 16 which is around 1.06 3 it looks like based on this guy but that's about what we wanted so our goal was 1.0 6 7 which my refractometer usually reads a little low on the Brix scale so I think we may have actually reached it um this might actually be like a perfectly done beer first time ever is it so warm yeah it's not taking out that much but if you feel like compared to the other you can do it on a lower setting too and it'll warm up put more all right Sean yep alrighty boy FX Wow looky there we gotta sanitize the spigot since it's been in giardia country sanitize this tube especially now I got dirt all over me alright hit it hit it up Saul blue control good ok so the plan for this is we're gonna ferment it for the first like three days with a blob tube connected to the gas in valve just into a container of water and then we're going to pull the blow-off and let it ferment under pressure for probably another four days and then come back and check it and see if we can drink it there's a floating dip tube in here so I'm not concerned about the true but basically I think we can actually just drink it off the fermenter which is kind of a novel idea but who knows I gotta leave like really soon so I'm hoping this ferments pretty quickly and turns out well quick I guess yeah they make something called a sponging valve it goes on the like the gas out and you can set a pressure so I think I'm gonna get one it yeah it keeps a constant pressure yeah so I until I start I should have like done the research a long time ago but until I did the research I didn't really fully know about it so I was like [ __ ] it's too like late anyway in the game to get one but I think that's a good idea for the next time yeah just just the fact that we're trying you know look how clear it is going into there there we go I got it's fine okay so our original gravity looks like it is 16.8 bricks which is looking like 1.0 six five are estimated was 1.0 six seven were right at four gallons we hit that spot on yeah good for us alrighty so I'm going to go ahead and pitch my yeast we've got our second-generation Nottingham a lease um we made a starter that was a thousand milliliters unfortunately we couldn't fit the thousand milliliters fully in the mason jar but you know it's a four gallon batch so we don't even need it all so I'm just gonna pour it right in goodbye ah there's still stuff that's probably just troub though it's all good nah we don't need it it's probably all like sediment anyway all right so we're just gonna throw our cap back on and then can I have the oh we got to dig a hole now we're gonna bury this okay so we're gonna dig a hole and bury this um it's gonna get probably in the 70s and we would like it to ideally firm it around 60 degrees so you know the ground is always way cooler around 50 degrees and consistent that's what we're looking for its consistency so I'm gonna grab a shovel and dig a hole basically and then we're going to attach the blow-off tube to the gas out and make a little airlock sensor oh my days oh my days you gotta set it slower though oh my guys Cindy you're my only hope oh I'm in trouble too I could just tell I'm in trouble I thought I was not in trouble but I am if you need a beer it's under the gum tree they're soulless under the gum tree [Laughter] maple staple IPA under the maple staple under the maple just yelled names there she might be drunk with a point alright switch off the Sean okay so I'm just gonna go ahead and throw in my dry hops we basically just buried it and you know I don't want to come down here and risk re-contaminating it after today so we're gonna throw in the dry hops hopefully the yeast and hops will play well together and it'll give us a nice juicy IPA so just gonna pull this it's super foamy in here already which looks good so I mean hopefully these don't clog my dip too but you know we only brought one hop bag down so oh wow and now I'm gonna attach our blow-up tube this is sanitizer obviously and I need my tube oh yeah Sean coming in with the hot tubes so I'm just gonna go ahead and sanitize this guy as well so this is going into my gas in valve and then just straight into this jar of peppers alright all right so that's all sealed and this is all good so we drilled a hole we drilled a hole so that it fits really tightly so it's not gonna just fall out but the lid cracked so you know that gas is still gonna be able to escape and it should all work and I'm just gonna set this like right here I didn't for many people hiking around hands hopefully in a week I can come back in drink this beer just right off of this keg in hopefully it's cold enough I think that's all I've got thanks for watching like and subscribe [Music] [Music] okay so I'm going to pull this blow-off tube and then we're gonna let it hopefully carbonate on its own and that's it you need your know what he's been murdered yet just you know I'm rolling on this one and I don't know why good here old [ __ ] here a bureau [ __ ] the bureau you use it to cut between scenes me roll [ __ ] gone in the bloopers to the neck I need a knife Wow I'm not good at that I just did it oh my god that's why reading it the second time I'm gonna redo it [Music] my god everybody so annoyed all right no I can't do it pull it together okay so it's been 25 minutes um and so we're at our five minute addition we are doing I rubbed it off where's my notebook anyway so we are also going to do feet that thing oh god this is so uncomfortable I can't see you guys Sarah how deep but about to sleep you knew I wanted to say it", "11ZCjwT_Ayg": "hi everyone welcome back to my channel it's Mary and today I'm playing with this tailored expression stamp set called if snowman can talk you want to have some fun with a stamp set this is the one the faces on this set are amazing so you get one snowman but you can do so many different things with just this one guy the faces will make it different you can place the arms differently you look at that grumpy face that's hilarious to me so I made this birthday card for one of our bosses at work and it was kind of a from all of us kind of card and once he started rereading people to the faces it was just hilarious so I started out stamped him out with some memento ink and then I'm going in and using the spectrum you are today I'm kind of back on those for a little bit and you want to make sure you use them the right black ink for whatever medium you're using so I would use versafine if I was using my um big clean clear color brush real brush markers you get the name but then with the alcohol markers you want to use memento or something like it so I showed you that red combo because I absolutely love that combination that's one of my favorites and I'm not gonna show you every single scarf I colored in every single hat but I'm just showing you what I used for the majority of them so for the hats I use this IG 6 + IG 10 and it's a black hat but you know with all the highlights you don't really want to go super just solid black I use the spectrum you are silver glitter pin for the little buckle and then I'm going in with some shading with IG one so shading is very very simple on here you just kind of figure where the scarf and the hat and all that would kind of hide it so or shade it out and then the next accent that I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take my white pen and I'm gonna make all their scarves different I think that really breaks up the card a lot so I'm doing stripes I'm doing polka dots I'm gonna do some Chevron's some large polka dots and so you kind of see I go through this but think about that get your gel pen out think about how you can alter an image or make something different just from that one piece see those big dots so I mean it really kind of makes the it look like they're different people if you own people you know I mean snowmen so there they are finished up and then I take the coordinating die and I'm going to cut out all of those running them through my Big Shot machine so that was very simple no fussy cutting neat it leaves a small white border so I like that all right I'm gonna put those aside I'm gonna take out a piece of cardstock 110 and it's gonna be sighs this is gonna be a big card so this is gonna be five by seven so the full sheet is gonna be 10 inches by 7 inches score it at 5 and then I'm gonna put that aside as well moving on to the little arms for my snowmen I'm gonna just color some paper and I'm gonna take the coordinating dies that come with the kit or the die that came with the kit and I'm gonna cut out a whole bunch of mittens and arms so I put those in my little bowl there to the side once I start getting all those assembled I put my arms on different ways in fact one of the arms broke and so I used that to my advantage and so you'll see in the end what I did there I'm gonna make some he'll size just by swerving my scissors up and down some paper makes it super easy and I'm gonna place those down with some foam tape before I get to that I'm gonna actually cut out a bunch of snowflakes that I had in my stash I had some dies from believe that was a stamp of approval collection two years ago and I'm just putting down on this snowflake II pattern paper I've had in my stash forever from Stampin Up then I'm gonna put down my hillsides with some phone some 3m foam mounting tape and I make this simple I want them actually to be the same level so I'm you see how I'm just gonna place that extra strip right at the bottom and that's gonna make the snowbanks the same exact level so one is not higher than the other but I'm still gonna get a gap in between those two white pieces to stick some snowmen there I'm gonna add some spectrum to our sparkle pen to the snowflakes and the mountains or the snow banks just to give it a little bit extra fun now I have this happy birthday dye that a wonderful friend of mine gave me and I cut that out about five times kind of regretting that decision afterwards because placing these one on top of another over and over again for how intricate they are let's just say I got my motor skills some practice there but I got that done and I made it a nice thick sentiment and then of course you want to play something heavy on top of it so it sticks really nicely um alright so I put that down on my paper and I started adding up placing out where I wanted all my sadness so I'm not gonna or not my stand with my snowman I'm not going to show you how I place them down but and this stamp set comes from Fiskars I got this on sale I think when one of the businesses was going out of business in Hawaii and it has a lot of great sentiments it's a birthday sentiments so I said just remember once you're over the hill you start to pick up speed so I thought that was pretty funny now here's how I'm laid out all of my snowmen and I'll show you a close up here in a little bit but you'll see the broken arm and I'm going to use some really strong score tape on some foam mounting phone what am I looking for foam paper you know what I'm saying and then I'm gonna place that down just to make that stand up just a little bit more fun foam there it is I'm gonna add some spectrum noir to certain parts of the card but not too many places and then that is pretty much gonna finish up the card see the little broken arm in the front it's actually if when we assigned people he was the guy with the broken arm but he fixes everything because he's just amazing like that the last thing that I'm gonna do is the buttons I forgot about the buttons so I grabbed some Nuvo drops in different colors some purple some pink some black I added black to a couple of them and and some red and then the last one I decided to use some sequins so I pulled up sequence from the last time into stamp kit and I'm adding that to that snowman so there it is there's the finished card and I threw one on the inside as well I hope you like it thank you so much for joining me I'll list all the things I used below and I hope you are ready for Christmas because it's right around the corner have a wonderful holiday and we'll see you back next time bye bye", "-jY830i2SWE": "what is up everyone mark here and welcome\u00a0\nto the prepared pantry episode three\u00a0\u00a0 today we're gonna make chicken parm now chicken\u00a0\nparm is an easy dish to make but it's also an\u00a0\u00a0 easy dish to screw up uh we are not going to do\u00a0\nthe casserole thing that makes the chicken soggy\u00a0\u00a0 if we're going to go to the trouble of frying\u00a0\nour chicken i want it to stay crispy so we're\u00a0\u00a0 going to be doing this restaurant style how does\u00a0\nthat differ from doing any casserole you'll see\u00a0\u00a0 in a minute when we get started i promise it's\u00a0\nstill an easy recipe it's still very doable\u00a0\u00a0 um and mostly includes stuff that you'll have on\u00a0\nhand anyway uh before we get started i want to\u00a0\u00a0 thank you all again for continuing to support\u00a0\nthe channel and continuing to watch my videos\u00a0\u00a0 if you're not already subscribed to my\u00a0\nchannel please do you can click the red\u00a0\u00a0 button down below and just make sure you hit\u00a0\nthat bell icon so you get a notification every\u00a0\u00a0 time i have a new video out all right\u00a0\nwithout further ado let's get started okay so before we get started i just want to\u00a0\nremind you that the full recipe for this is\u00a0\u00a0 going to be down in the description below the\u00a0\nvideo we're going to kind of take this a piece\u00a0\u00a0 at a time as we move through because we are\u00a0\nalso going to be making the sauce from scratch\u00a0\u00a0 so the first thing we need to do is butterfly\u00a0\nand pound out our chicken breast so i've already\u00a0\u00a0 trim these a little bit of excess fat and uh\u00a0\ndried them a lot of them with a paper towel\u00a0\u00a0 we are going to carefully cut them uh crosswise\u00a0\nfold them over and then pound them flat we\u00a0\u00a0 want these to both come out to be around an\u00a0\neighth of an inch once they're pounded out\u00a0\u00a0 so just be careful when you do\u00a0\nthis you don't want to cut yourself and you want to make sure you\u00a0\ndon't quite cut all the way through i'm just going to cut both of these\u00a0\nfirst and then we'll do the pounding okay fold our plastic wrap over so now\u00a0\nwe've got this between two sheets of plastic\u00a0\u00a0 i'm going to put a little bit of water on the\u00a0\nsurface of the plastic here just to help the\u00a0\u00a0 tenderizing mallet kind of glide over the surface a little more easily\u00a0\u00a0 and we are just going to use the flat side\u00a0\nof the mallet to pound this out now again\u00a0\u00a0 i'm looking for about an eighth of an inch\u00a0\nin total so we'll just start flattening just be careful not to overdo it you don't want to\u00a0\nsmash your chicken breasts into complete oblivion\u00a0\u00a0 and just lay this on a wire rack and repeat with the second breast okay we're gonna salt these on both sides so and we're just going to cover\u00a0\nthis loosely with plastic wrap all right so this is going to go into\u00a0\nthe refrigerator for about 30 minutes\u00a0\u00a0 um i'm going to do that and we're gonna come back\u00a0\nand start making our sauce okay it's time to get\u00a0\u00a0 started on our sauce so we have a quarter of a\u00a0\ncup of olive oil that's gonna go into the pan\u00a0\u00a0 and we just want to heat that through and once\u00a0\nit's shimmering we're going to add our garlic that was eight cloves of garlic minced by the way okay it's just starting to brown we're\u00a0\ngoing to add four anchovy fillets\u00a0\u00a0 you won't taste the fish i promise\u00a0\nthis really just adds some umami\u00a0\u00a0 and just kind of smash them up\u00a0\nwith the back of the spatula red pepper flake it's a half a teaspoon of\u00a0\nred pepper uh parmesan cheese\u00a0\u00a0 that's two tablespoons and\u00a0\ntwo 28 ounce cans of tomatoes now once this is bubbling hot we are going to\u00a0\nreduce the heat and let it simmer for about a\u00a0\u00a0 half hour to an hour during that time\u00a0\nit should reduce to about half of this\u00a0\u00a0 i'm just gonna again smash the\u00a0\ntomatoes with the back of the spatula so at this point it is thickening up nicely\u00a0\u00a0 almost there we want this to be almost dry\u00a0\nwe want it to be a bit thicker than this\u00a0\u00a0 and this is still going to be more sauce\u00a0\nthan we need for the chicken parm so\u00a0\u00a0 obviously the the normal side that you\u00a0\nwould have with chicken parm is pasta\u00a0\u00a0 so what you could do is use some of this sauce\u00a0\nloosen it up a little bit with some broth\u00a0\u00a0 or wine and it's perfect for your pasta side\u00a0\nnow we're going to try and do something a\u00a0\u00a0 little bit healthier here and the side that\u00a0\ni'm going to make to go along with this tonight\u00a0\u00a0 is just some garlic broccoli and we'll make\u00a0\nthat um once the chicken is prepared and\u00a0\u00a0 just before we're ready to sauce it and melt\u00a0\nthe cheese and finish everything up but i'm\u00a0\u00a0 going to let this go for a few more minutes and\u00a0\nwe'll come back and check on it when it's done all right as you can see the sauce has now\u00a0\nthickened significantly and this is exactly\u00a0\u00a0 what we want not only does that help concentrate\u00a0\nthe flavor but it's also going to help prevent\u00a0\u00a0 our chicken parm from getting soggy now you\u00a0\ncan you can drain the tomatoes before you put\u00a0\u00a0 them in if you like i left them undrained\u00a0\nonly because i wanted to reduce that extra\u00a0\u00a0 liquid from the cans down you know adds more\u00a0\nflavor this took about an hour to reduce this\u00a0\u00a0 sauce but it probably would have gone quite a bit\u00a0\nquicker if i had just drained them but again you\u00a0\u00a0 know i sacrificed some time for flavor all right\u00a0\ni'm going to take this off the heat and set it\u00a0\u00a0 aside and we're going to get ready to make our\u00a0\nbreading all right let's make our breading so\u00a0\u00a0 for this we're going to need 120 grams of plain\u00a0\nbreadcrumbs uh that's about a cup we're gonna\u00a0\u00a0 need 20 grams of salt and vinegar potato chips\u00a0\nthat's about 13 or 14 chips depending on the size\u00a0\u00a0 we're going to need two teaspoons of dried\u00a0\nparsley two teaspoons of dried oregano and a teaspoon and a half of garlic powder okay we're gonna just close up the bag\u00a0\u00a0 as much of the air as we can and we're\u00a0\njust going to break up the chips by hand and just get this mixed and the chips don't need to be\u00a0\nvery small of course trunks is fine let's get our breading station set up all\u00a0\nright i've got our chicken out of the fridge\u00a0\u00a0 i've already gone and patted it dry again\u00a0\nwith paper towel and because we salted this\u00a0\u00a0 before it went in chances are that was gonna\u00a0\ndraw out some moisture so you probably will\u00a0\u00a0 have to towel it off a little bit so next\u00a0\nwe are going to add our breading mixture to\u00a0\u00a0 one of three pie plates that we're\u00a0\ngoing to use for our breading stations so that's our breading mix and we've got 70 grams of flour in another tray\u00a0\nand we're going to beat two eggs for the last one okay so we're going to take our breasts one\u00a0\nat a time and dredge it in the flour first and we just want to make\u00a0\nsure that it is fully coated including the edges and shaking off the\u00a0\nexcess it's going to go into the egg and then from the egg into our breading mix if possible try to keep one\u00a0\nhand more dry one hand more wet\u00a0\u00a0 that way you end up with less issues\u00a0\nof breading sticking all over you now if you wanted to do this in more of a\u00a0\nfamily-style casserole it is still possible to do\u00a0\u00a0 that with this recipe uh what you would do instead\u00a0\nis uh instead of leaving these breasts whole you\u00a0\u00a0 would cut them into about six or seven pieces each\u00a0\njust smaller you know uniform as you can get them\u00a0\u00a0 and bread them that way and um and then\u00a0\nthey can be tiled into a casserole dish\u00a0\u00a0 in a similar way to how we are going to prepare\u00a0\nthese with our sauce and cheese at the end all right now we're going to get this\u00a0\ncleaned up and get ready to cook our chicken\u00a0\u00a0 okay let's cook up some chicken so\u00a0\nwe're going to get our burner going and we're going to heat up about a tablespoon\u00a0\nof olive oil and a couple tablespoons of butter and when the butter starts foaming up that's\u00a0\nabout when we're going to drop in our chicken\u00a0\u00a0 and of course we're doing\u00a0\nrestaurant style portions\u00a0\u00a0 so we're only going to be able\u00a0\nto cook one of these at a time all right so we're going to let this\u00a0\ngo on the first side covered for\u00a0\u00a0 about two or three minutes and check on it and the clip all right now we're going to wipe out\u00a0\nthe pan and repeat with the second breast okay rinse repeat tablespoon of olive oil a couple of tablespoons of butter and now this is actually one instance\u00a0\nwhere i am not bothering to tempt the\u00a0\u00a0 chicken to know that it's done it's so thin\u00a0\nuh that just getting that color on both sides\u00a0\u00a0 is a pretty good indication that it's good time to flip all right all right now i'm going to throw these in a\u00a0\nwarm oven just to keep them at temperature for\u00a0\u00a0 a few minutes just long enough for us to throw\u00a0\ntogether some garlic broccoli okay so with the\u00a0\u00a0 chicken uh staying warm in the oven i'm gonna\u00a0\nadd just a little bit of olive oil to the pan and a couple of cloves of chopped garlic and i just want this to sizzle and get a little\u00a0\nbit of color before we go ahead and add the\u00a0\u00a0 broccoli that is looking good oh and\u00a0\ngoes just one large crown of broccoli\u00a0\u00a0 cut into relatively small florets all right so this on medium i'm going to\u00a0\ncover it and let it steam a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 so that it cooks a little bit more thoroughly in\u00a0\na couple of minutes we'll take the cover off and\u00a0\u00a0 start mixing it just make sure that it's not\u00a0\nburning that we get some good color on there\u00a0\u00a0 and then it's cooked all the way through and we'll\u00a0\nset this aside and we'll continue with our chicken bright green and beautiful okay and i'm going to leave the cover\u00a0\noff because again i want to develop some\u00a0\u00a0 a little bit of browning here now i don't want\u00a0\nto take this too far it kind of depends on how\u00a0\u00a0 you like your broccoli i like a little bit of\u00a0\nbrown there but not too much and i'll press it\u00a0\u00a0 into the pan a little bit with the back of\u00a0\nthe spatula i hope helps with the browning all right that looks good to\u00a0\nme i'm going to kill the heat\u00a0\u00a0 and because i like a little extra garlic\u00a0\ni'm going to go with a little garlic powder and then stir that in and i'm just going to\u00a0\ncover this and set it aside while we get back\u00a0\u00a0 to the chicken okay we are in the home stretch now\u00a0\ni promise you so first thing we need to do is take\u00a0\u00a0 some of our sauce and lay it out\u00a0\nin a very thin layer on a sheet pan\u00a0\u00a0 and i just kind of want to put down enough\u00a0\nfor an area that'll be covered by the chicken\u00a0\u00a0 that's there's no need to waste any\u00a0\nsauce on anywhere that's not exposed\u00a0\u00a0 this chicken is just going\u00a0\nto sit on a bit of sauce here okay now we're not quite ready for\u00a0\nthe chicken just yet this is going\u00a0\u00a0 to go under the broiler on high for a couple of\u00a0\nminutes we're going to watch it really closely\u00a0\u00a0 we just want it to darken a little bit and\u00a0\ndevelop a little bit more of a deep flavor all right so as you can see this darkened just\u00a0\na little bit we're going to put down our chicken and spoon on a little bit\u00a0\nmore sauce now the key here is to have a somewhat light touch with\u00a0\nthe sauce we don't want to overdo it\u00a0\u00a0 it's a thick dryer sauce to\u00a0\nbegin with so that should help us and i have here two ounces each of\u00a0\nshredded mozzarella and shredded fontina now again if you wanted to do this as a casserole\u00a0\nyou absolutely could just instead of saucing\u00a0\u00a0 and broiling on the pan you would do it in\u00a0\na casserole dish and as i said you'd cut\u00a0\u00a0 and fry smaller pieces of chicken\u00a0\nso that you could tile them together\u00a0\u00a0 sort of creating the same thing that\u00a0\nwe're doing here except you'd be doing\u00a0\u00a0 it on the inside of a casserole\u00a0\nwith smaller pieces of chicken all right so we're gonna park this back\u00a0\nonto the broiler for a couple of minutes\u00a0\u00a0 and then we will finally be ready to eat\u00a0\nokay it is time to eat let's plate this up so i don't want to waste any of that extra sauce first i'll try the broccoli good garlic flavor on that so um oh that's good the sauce is a\u00a0\nlittle sweet very flavorful it packs a punch now again if you were making pasta as a side\u00a0\nthere's plenty of leftover sauce from this recipe\u00a0\u00a0 you would just want to thin it out a\u00a0\nlittle bit with some water or broth or wine\u00a0\u00a0 and mix that in with your pasta and that\u00a0\nwould be fabulous with this too again i was\u00a0\u00a0 just trying to be a little more healthy and go\u00a0\nwith the broccoli this time eat your vegetables guys that's going to do it for\u00a0\nanother one we'll see you next time you", "o9pDIC1nh-M": "what's going on guys alright so this video ended up being way way longer than I anticipated it turned into more of a vlog style video than a review but I promise the reviews in there and if you just want to see the review I'll put a timecode down in the description you can click on it it'll take you right to the review but if you want to watch the whole video that'd be cool too hope you enjoy so I posted a picture on Instagram asking people if they prefer three inch or three-and-a-half inch shells and boy it caused quite a stink we were supposed to have a discussion you've got an angry so we're gonna not talk about it we're gonna be about it we're gonna go right we're gonna go snag some shotgun shells from the local gander and do a little test shall we so from what I gathered from the comments is there's basically two camps and no one's really in between you're either on the side of I shoot three and a half inch shells because they don't make four inch shells or you're on the side of the argument that says two or three quarters enough I only shoot three inch because it's hard to find two and three quarters if you can't get them close enough to shoot with three inch you shouldn't be shooting and that's all well and good I'm not I'm not picking a side but it brings up another point that I'd like to talk about but we'll talk about that in another video we're all in the same team guys just because it's not what you use doesn't mean it's wrong but we'll save that for another video right now we're gonna go to Gander we're gonna snag some shells and we're gonna do some tests all right we have arrived to beady gander go see what they got all right when you got blindsided first three and a half inch two shots 1,400 feet a second 26 bucks the exact same shell that's three inches 22 $5 difference they got Winchester there to shot again three-inch two shots 1550 12 bucks three half-days two shot here we go 17 bucks so about a five dollar difference per box again I think that dude test two different kinds of shells all right we've got our shells look at this nice eco-friendly bag we're gonna go shoot something all right step one of the process is complete I'm thinking we're gonna need some big pieces of cardboard to shoot at the board that we shoot at is really shot up and I want to shoot it a bigger target I want to see all the pellets the whole spread rather than just shooting it a 12 inch piece of paper and you only get to see the pellets that hit the target I want to see you know the full spread of what we got going on so we're gonna run in here to the home depot see what they got for us all right well that was a success we got a big roll of paper three feet wide so we'll probably do like a three foot by three foot square put that on the boards we'll be able to see a lot more of the pellet strikes that should make people happy so I'm gonna go ahead and make a prediction I'm gonna say that the three and a half inch shell is going to put more pellets on target but it's only going to be marginally better than the three inch it's going to be a small enough gap where the three-inch guys are going to say see I told you three 1/2 inch shells aren't worth it you don't need that but it's going to be just big enough to where the three and a half inch guys you're going to say see I told you the extra five dollars is worth having you know however many extra pellets on so I don't think it's gonna change anybody's mind his moon make the argument worse but we're gonna find out nonetheless it is test time all right so we're going to be shaping these bigger targets but for test purposes we're only going to be concerned with what is inside it's raining perfect timing great that is that's exactly that is exactly what I wanted come on I guess we're gonna have to wait this one out for a minute you know what we came here to do a test and we're doing a test don't worry about this rain come back gonna be oh goodness so we're going to cut these into a roughly three-foot pieces okay so after further assessment the chest is gonna have to wait till a later day because it's raining a lot so this is to be continued mmm all right it's a new day the sun is shining and we're gonna do a shotgun shell test also side note I got a drone I've actually had a drone for a while but I've never flown it outside of my house so we made a little bit of drone footage in here too and if you came here not to be entertained but just to learn about shotgun shells well I apologize you can fast-forward to the shotgun shell part but this is my video I can do what I want so ok we're back again this is take two [Music] gonna be shooting at 30 yards see who can put the most pellets in the square and what they're the bigger paper is I just want to see what the entire pattern looks like if there's any major differences here we go Nate who's gonna be helping us Azir protection which one we gonna shoot first first one in line okay that 3-inch two-shot Winchester Hey so we got that was the 3-inch two-shot Winchester matters a little bit high one shot down three more to go well that's been impressed with that I'm not gonna lie so next we'll do the three 1/2 inch Winchester two-shot so this is the three and a half inch this is the three and a half inch Winchester and it is substantially better absolutely worth the extra $5 a box in my opinion for this application I'm interested to see how it compares to the blindside so what's this target out the next will be three-inch blindside still number two shot trying to keep things as fair as possible I think it's better it's better it's definitely better than the Winchester three-inch but not nearly as good as the three-and-a-half so during a half inch blindside okay last one this is one I'm most excited about seeing that is a pretty doggone good package blindside that was our square one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen we got 14 inside the square and a pretty good pattern overall little behind left but they were all like that now this is the 3 inch blind side 1 2 3 4 5 yep 5 on the 3 inch blind side still a decent pattern not nearly as dense as the Korean half 3 inch Winchester 1 and I will count that one will count that one mm close three of them in the square with the 3 inch Winchester the three and a half inch Winchester I miss my square up a little bit 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 we got 15 on this one there in the Blind Side that's what you get what the paper looks like on the back that's a solid pattern that's what it looks like on the back of the blindside so those are two three and a half so three and a half inch Winchester did fifteen three and a half inch blindside did fourteen three-inch Winchester did three kind of three-inch blindside did five so that pretty well settles it for me you can make your own mind up I would say there's no other conclusion that you can draw from this other than you should be spending the extra five dollars on three and a half's if your gun will accept them so I hope this video helped you leave me a comment down below let me know if this changed your mind at all if you're gonna stick with threes if you always been shooting threes or maybe if you're gonna accept your going to move up to three and a half's or maybe both shot three and a half's and this just confirmed what you thought but anyways enjoy some drone footage and while we were down here we figured why not break out the fun guns [Music]", "w5veSvL_wgo": "hey guys Jake from pros go here we get a lot of questions coming in to customer care about what is a part they're looking at our data sheets and they see a mix this product at one part product to three parts water and they say well how much is a part well we're going to talk a little about that today and show that it doesn't matter what size container you're working with or how much material you're working with as long as each part is equivalent to the others my first things first always make sure you get your proper PPE on when mixing product if we're mixing this product say at a one-part cleaner to three part water dilution ratio I'm gonna take one part of cleaner and I'm gonna take three parts of water always add the water to the bucket first and then add the cleaner so in this case I would take three of these buckets pour those in and then add my equal one part of cleaner to the bucket after that it doesn't matter if we're talking individual gallons if we're talking fives if we're talking pints even a cap full I've got one part to four parts dilution ratio and I just want to make a little tiny bit up I can take one part of the cleaner and mix it with four equal parts of water and I've got my proper ratio so again a part is a part is a part it doesn't matter if it's a gallon a cap full of five a drum whatever it may be long as each of the parts are equal for more information contact us at one eight hundred two five five four two five five find us online at pro SoCo calm and remember when you're working with prosecco products it's always you a project [Music]", "w7iSjFQx-Mc": "hi everyone this is day three of distance learning today we're going to be working on pages 7 8 & 9 now so let's start with the first one Danny buys 2 and 5/10 ounces of birdseed each ounce of birdseed cost 18 cents the mono represents the price of one ounce of birdseed how much does Denny spend for the bird seed okay so this is what we know we know that each ounce costs 18 cents and we know that he is going to purchase this two and a half times so therefore we are going to multiply by two and five tenths when we're multiplying numbers with decimals we need to remember that we take out the decimal and we multiply that first so let's begin 25 times 18 8 times 5 is 40 16 plus 4 is 20 once I'm done with the 8 cross it out cross out everything I carry the 1 is in the tenths place so I drop a 0 5 + 2 450 18 times 5 is equal to 450 but my original problem did not have 18 times 5 we had 18 hundredths and we had 2 & 5 tenths so we had a total of 1 2 3 digits behind the decimal so when I write my answer I put one two three digits behind my decimal in my product when it comes to money we only go to the hundreds place so my answer is 45 cents in other words 45 hundredths which is B number 2 Marco drew a model to illustrate an expression to find its value which equation correctly matches Marcos model so here's the model given to us so as I'm looking at my bottle I see that I only have one model and then I see that my model was originally one two three fourths and one of the fourths got cut into two so I have 1/4 that was cut equally into two and the value of each of those pieces would be 1 out of 8 which is 1/8 my answer was cheap number 3 so Alyssa made the model below from sugar cubes now I want you to think about that look at the model if I've got sugar cubes stacked on top of each other can I have a floating cube no I cannot so keep that in mind please what is the volume what is the what is the volume of Alyssa's model so please remember that the volume means how much can fit so what this could occupy in other words how many sugar cubes do I have so let's break this down into different layers so I've got my very top layer and my middle layer and my very bottom layer so I've got 3 layers the very top layer is easy to see that I just have one cube and then underneath that one cube there's got to be a cube because it cannot be floating so that middle layer right there has the one two three cubes and the one underneath that top one so so far I've got my top layer with one cube my middle layer with not three but four cubes and then look at the very bottom layer these four cubes right here cannot be floating so therefore I've got to have those four cubes underneath them and then one two three four five more so that would be a total of nine cubes so in all my model is made out of 14 cubes so my volume would be 14 sugar cubes my answer was B Essen boy number 4 the input/output table shows how many inches Y are given are in given number of feet X which point below represents the ordered pair that fits the pattern so right here they're telling us that there is a pattern so I went ahead and I created the graph that was given feet and inches so 9 feet gives us 108 inches 6 feets gives us 72 inches 12 feet gives us 144 inches I can see that the pattern here is time 212 meaning for every feet I multiply 12 and it gives me their inches the question was which one follows this pattern so what I did first is anytime I'm given some form of a graph I like to know what points there are being represented by so here they are your point Q point R point s and point T please remember that when you are graphing or getting coordinates it's always going to be X comma wine in fifth grade we only focus on quad 1 both x and y are positive numbers in quadrant one okay so therefore X will only tell us to go ranked and Y will only tell us to go up because again this is based on quadrant one so when um once I get this down I want to know which one follows the rule x 12 well what did I do to 0 to make it 12 there's only one thing that I could have done which was I added 12 that's not my rule cuz at the addition of 12 one time it's not the same as me multiplying by 12 but did I do to four to make it 48 well I multiply that by 12 that looks good what did I do to stakes I multiply that by 4 what did I do to 8 I multiply that by 6 so the only one that followed my rule was R because 4 times 12 is 48 giving me my answer of d next page I'm solo it says Luke has two horses named Sally and rows Sally eats about eleven and two-fifths pounds of food every day Rose eats about 2 and 3/4 times as much food as Sally approximately how many total pounds of food does Sally and Rose eat each day so we wanted to combine in order for us to find that combined amount of food that the horses eat I first need to know what the horses eat so we have Sally and we have the Rose please remember that the question said about so we know that Sally eats 11 and two-fifths well 11 and to fit it's about 11 pounds because the numerator here is less than half of my denominator I'm gonna round down not up and then Rose is going to eat what Sally eats 2 times 2 and 3/4 because Rose eats 2 and 3/4 times as much as what Sally eats we already said that this right here what's about 11 so notice here on the 2 and 3/4 3 is more than half of my denominator so then right here I'm going to round up so instead of having 2 and 3/4 this is actually about 3 pounds so Rose really eats about 33 pounds Sally eats 11 rows each 33 so in all the horses eat about 44 pounds of food my answer is C number 2 simplifying this expression so please remember anytime that we are simplifying any form of expression you need to write your gems so here's my gems grouping symbol is always first so I'm gonna write what I see inside my grouping symbols innermost grouping symbols go first here I've got a subtraction I've got an addition I've got I'm sorry I'm still need to focus on this one I've got a multiplication and then I've got an addition again all of these are inside grouping symbols then when I get out of the grouping symbols I'm only left with a division sign so when I saw this I'm going to solve this in the order that I've provided for you I'm gonna start here subtraction I like to underline everything that I do because when I do it like this then it just kind of gets me in track of things nine minus two is seven so I'm done with this one then it says that I'm doing an addition here it is two plus one is three check then it says that I am doing a multiplication seven times three is twenty-one then it says that I'm doing in addition since both fractions have the same denominators I can go ahead and add this 1/4 plus 3/4 equal 4/4 4/4 is the same as one whole so 21 divided by one anything divided by one it's that number my answer is 21 and again I kept up with everything I did everything one at a time to help me to guide me I went ahead and I underlined each step that I did as I followed my jumps the answer to two was Jack number three Wayne counts the bikes and cars in the school parking lot there are 13 bikes and 98 cars which equation can't be used to find T the number of tires in a parking lot so again I always start with what I know what do I know I know that there are 13 bikes and I know that there's 98 cars won't bikes only have two tires so 13 times the two cars have four tires so 98 times 4 and we want the total amount so these two will be adding each other and I have them it'll give me my total number of tires my answer is C number four Dexter buys five pallets of pecans for $25.50 to find the cost of each pound Dexter begins to draw an area model so here's the area model again the area model what it says is that you are multiplying the length times the width and it gives you the complete space inside so here they give us this Gibbon model five times five is 25 so then you start asking yourself what times five will give me 50 hundredths well I always like to focus on what is easy for me so remember what times five will give me 50 hundredths so I start with ignore the decimal for a second what times five gives me 50 well 10 because 5 times 10 gives me 50 but my product needs to have two digits behind the decimal - so how can i rewrite this number so that I have two digits behind the decimal oh one two decimal five times ten hundredths gives me 50 hundreds my answer is f please remember that even if I have no zeros after the last non-zero digit and as long as it's behind the decimals they are equivalent so one tenth and ten hundredths represent the same my answer was actually robbed incorrectly solved the problem you've seen these steps now before I can answer what the mistake was I need to solve it myself so here it goes anytime we're adding fractions please understand that the denominators must be the same here I've got six and ten six and ten are not the same denominator so I started thinking of the multiples of six and the multiples of ten what is the smallest number that they have in common because I like to use always the least common denominator and that would be 30 in order for me to make these fractions equivalent whatever change I do to the denominator I have to do to the numerator that's the only way that they will become equivalent so six times what you gave me thirty six times five and again the rule is whatever I do to the denominator I must do to the numerator 5 times 5 is 25 what did I do to tend to make it 30 mole times 3 whatever I do to the denominator I do to the numerator 3 times 3 is 9 now that my denominators are the same now I can add my fractions well 25 plus 9 would give me 34 my head cannot be bigger than my body because that is improper therefore it is also an improper fraction so then right here I know that this can be simplified how many groups of 30 economic with 34 and can make one complete group how many will I have remaining I will have 4 this should have been my answer and Rob chose 14 over 25 which is not even a whole obviously my answer is bigger than 1 so let's see what the mistake was the mistake was in my equivalent fraction Rob did not multiply the 3 to the numerator of the second fraction he only multiplied the 3 to the denominator so my answer is C he wrote the wrong equivalent fraction for 3 times number 2 Jerry's grandmother worked in a department store for me years now that she has retired she received a monthly Social Security check Gerry's grandmother paid a tax during her working years that helped funder Social Security which is this tax well whenever you are putting your pain into different kind of taxes on your payroll that is um that's actually payroll tax sales tax is what you pay when you go to the store property tax is the tax that you pay on your property so my answer is F payroll tax number three can't use 1/4 yard of red ribbon 1/8 yard of yellow ribbon and 1/2 yard of blue ribbon for her mom's birthday gift it each strip below represents one yard of ribbon which shaded strip represents the total amount of ribbon Katie used because we want the total amount that she used the total ribbon that she used we will be adding again whenever we are dealing with fractions my denominators must be the same and they're not so I want you to think about the multiples of 4 of 8 and of 2 what is the smallest multiple that they have in common and their smallest multiple is actually 8 so I am going to rewrite each fraction but I'm going to have 8 as a denominator first thing I notice that this was already an 8 so if I did nothing guess what I'm gonna do nothing to the numerator as well now here's my first change what did I do to this 4 to make it 8 let me multiply it by 2 again whatever I do to the denominator I have to do to the numerator 2 times 1 is 2 what did I do to - to make it 8 and multiply it by 4 whatever I change I do to the denominator I do to the numerator 1 times 4 is four to eight plus 1/8 plus four eight equals seven hey my answer is C because there's seven of the eight shaded last question of the day yes Shawn uses a calculator to divide 256 by nineteen the calculator displays the quotient of 13 and 473 thousands which shows Shawn's quotient rounded to the nearest tenth and the nearest hundredth so I am going to round 13 and 473 first it said that I'm rounding to the nearest tenth please remember to create a quick place value chart so that you are not messing up determining the place value of each digit here's my decimal in front of my decimal is my ones in front of my once is my tenth but behind my decimal is my tens with a th and then is my hundredths with a th and lastly is my thousands with a th so the first one that I'm rounding is my tenths place I always underline the digit I'm rounding and I circle the one to the right the one I circle will tell me to either add one or had nothing if it's five or more I will raise the score so I will add one thirteen and four plus one is five everything else becomes zero and then 13 and 473 thousands I am to round now to the nearest hundredths hundredths underline the seven circle the three is this five or more no it is not it is however four or less so I will let it rest me I will add nothing everything after the digit that I've underlined also becomes a zero here are my two answers therefore my answer is H I really hope this helped guys please any questions that you have feel free to you know reach out to me and I will do my best in this crazy situation that we're on working I do want you to expect some quizzes here and there let's see how we're doing I want you to not just watch me but also practice on your own have a great day guys bye", "7HuVkXLreWE": "12-gauge 1 ounce rifled slug what are some of the things that you can do with the 12-gauge slug how about relocate 50 pounds of water break a concrete block or you could drill a hole through a 4-inch fence post yeah you can do all those things and probably a long list of other stuff that was a six gallon container a concrete construction block or foundation block and this is a four by four fence post treated would clean entry there and I know you're asking the question did it go all the way through yes it did no problem whatsoever and that was from about 25 feet there 35 40 feet on the block and I think 30 feet or so on the container using the Mossberg 590 a1 special purpose this is a smoothbore and a 20 inch barrel so I'm using rifled slugs this is also known as a foster slug 12-gauge two and three-quarter inch shell 1600 feet per second one ounce at one ounce converts to four hundred and thirty seven point five grains so when you calculate foot-pounds energy it is approximately two thousand four hundred and eighty four foot-pounds that is a lot of force for size comparison on the Left you have a 45 ACP 230 grain jacketed hollow point I think that's a Winchester PD X 1 and then the slug on the right you can clearly see the rifling and when you turn it over and look underneath it is hollowed out so it's not a solid all the way through for the main attraction we have a block of the sim test media this has been calibrated to match 10% ordnance gelatin specifications it weighs approximately 50 pounds 20 inches in length but I still think this is an excellent pass-through opportunity today we have some water jug back up and then a large plastic container that is stuffed with dry newspaper and a surprise in the very back we have a 40 pound bag of dry cement just waiting as that last resort try this from 20 feet if there was ever a day that the block could fly off the table is today so I have taken precautions that was awesome excellent shot placement it did break the board check out this cavity that is just some serious nastiness Wow there's the thumb wow that is just that's just nasty great use or not depending on how you wanted this to penetrate is that it is inside of the block it did not exit I did lose a water-jug due to splinters coming out of that board so has some leakage on that but otherwise a pretty clean test let's break it down here's how it gets started and this was not really what I expected here is the entry point this is the left half the block by the way as I was cutting start to see this permanent stretch cavity really opened up about an inch and a half in from this point to this point where it narrows now show you that in a moment that is seven inches the widest from here to here is four inches and it is approximately an inch and a half yes it was an inch and a half deep on this site that is just unbelievable now it continues on I did peel that back away a little bit but a segment and I mean a segment not all of it but a segment of the slug was embedded in the bottom right there it was stopped by the board and that leading edge is at 12 inches so it's split off at some point I'm not sure exactly where here is the other side of the block obviously captured most of the permanent cavity on that other half but this is about an inch and a half two inches wide this is one in three quarters of an inch deep this carries on we get into some paper wadding here and some more paper there whoops there's the other half of the slug and the leading edge of that is it 10 inches so we'll never know where its split off I'd say probably in this side to 10 inch mark obviously they back up and there is an overhead of both halves of the tracks here is another perspective and there are the two halves or are they they don't go together and the weights coming in at point seven three seven ounces so something is missing looking at this perspective you can see how this opens up and check it out I dug this out and actually I haven't taken it out it's still embedded but on the left side of the block and the track there is another chunk of the slug so it is split into two is split into three so now with the sections I've recovered we're still coming in a little bit less at 0.98 three ounces I believe that's the puzzle and it's odd that two of the three pieces really flattened out diameter at that mark is one point two to five inches if you look there on the lower right hand corner of the box that's actually the top of the box it's just the way it's positioned right now you see the primary purpose for these and a lot of you already know that it is for hunting medium game maybe even some large game and a lot of folks do that I'll use these for target practice I do not use them for home defense it's not my first choice in spite of the fact that we you know this is going to be a fight stopper you would think or hope but that's not my first choice I have some other things that I use in my 12-gauge so I hope that from all these perspectives whether or not it's home defense or hunting or target practice you got a little bit out of this maybe something educational and possibly a little bit of fun we're going to close out with some slow-motion thanks for watching", "Hk6dQDDCCdg": "hello everyone I'm Jeff Stanley with Stanley handcrafted and today we're gonna be talking about a question that comes up quite a bit in the groups and that is weighing your wax trying to fill trying to figure out exactly how much wax and oil so that you can fill a container perfectly and not have leftover wax or not enough wax to go into it now this is one that I can't believe I haven't covered before it's come up in a lot of the groups that I've been in for the last couple years and the confusion comes from adding the wax and getting your oil percentage so basically let's use the basic ratio the 16 ounces we're gonna use 10% so if you're you're adding 10 percent to 16 ounces of wax you're basically doing 1.6 ounces of oil so if you're taking the 16 ounces of wax you're adding the 1.6 ounces of oil you're coming up with 17 points 6 ounces of total wax and oil together now that's not a problem if you're filling some of the 3 the 8 ounce jelly jars it's gonna fill three of those just perfect but the question comes up what happens if you wanted to fill a jar that that's exactly 16 ounces and that becomes a problem because you've got extra wax and oil that's of course not gonna go into that now you could of course just poor couple melts but a lot of people like to be exact and what ends up happening is a lot of people will get their measurements they'll weigh the 16 ounces of wax they'll get their percentage which is 10% 1 point 6 ounces and then they'll actually subtract 1 point 6 ounces of wax and then add the oil so that they come up with a grand total of 16 ounces now of course on the surface this seems just fine you're removing the wax you're adding the oil you're still coming up with 16 ounces but what happens is once you remove some of that wax you've already made calculations on that weight the 16 ounces and when you reduce that down to basically 14.4 your oil stays the same and you've essentially increased the oil percentage up to around eleven and a half percent this one gets glossed over it's real easy to just kind of gloss over and I think about this one I have definitely done this one and the reason I wanted to bring this up is because the discussion came up in the group the last week and Maria McDonald actually came back after discussing in one of the threads she actually came back with the formula to come up with the exact wax and weight ratio to basically fill a container so if you're 16-ounce or a 20 ounce or 30 ounce this is the formula to come up with exactly how much oil you will need for the wax that goes into it so we're gonna go ahead and cut right over I'm gonna get out the the chalkboard again because a lot of people like that one and just do like a quick overview and show the formula on that one all right this is a question that comes up quite a bit in the groups I've seen it around for a long time and it came up the other day and it was discussed in one thread and then it was brought back up and made very clear in another thread by Maria MacDonald so I kind of wanted to go over that with this one because one of the formulas that she posted in there was really good and I wanted to highlight exactly that so most of the time when you're doing your waxes and you're coming up with your weights let's call it 16 ounces because that's typically what everybody goes by 16 ounces of wax and if you want to get 10% oil of course you're gonna do times 0.1 which is 1.6 ounces of oil what you're going to do is you're going to add that 1.6 ounces to the 16 so you're gonna get a grand total a seventeen point six ounces of wax and oil and then of course if you're pouring that into like the the 8 ounce jelly jars you're gonna get three of those but the point has been made but what happens if you want to fill a container that is exactly 6 ounces or 16 ounces what do you do now I've seen this come up a lot what they'll do is they'll take their container which is 16 ounces they'll take their oil which is one point six ten ten ounces and they'll subtract the one point six from the 16 ounces which comes up to fourteen point four ounces of wax and then they'll add the one point six ounces of oil which of course equals sixteen ounces total now I've seen a lot of people do it this way and this is definitely not the right way to do this and the reason why is once you take basically you made your calculation off of 16 ounces of wax which is one point six ounces so when you go ahead and remove the wax you've made enough room to add your oil but what you've also done is if you've also increased your percentage so fourteen point four times ten percent is actually one point four ounces so what we've done is you've basically up your oil percentage and what you're adding isn't ten percent anymore it's actually more like eleven and a half percent now depending on the wax that may not be a big deal but if you're going for a certain percentage like a nine or like a nine percent this is definitely gonna come off it's gonna be very wrong quite kitty now for me when I've done this before I've always taken the container which is sixteen ounces and I've just subtracted two ounces because I knew the oil was going to be around like 1 to 1.5 which is just under 16 ounces we're looking at like we're looking at like just under 16 ounces fifteen point nine five and for me that's always been just fine I've never really cared too much to get exact but Maria McDonald actually came up with the formula or posted the formula which is actually why I wanted to do this video because it was a very good formula which will calculate exactly how much oil you need in your wax to fill a certain ounce container so if we're calling that one 16 ounces so instead of the other one where you multiplied by point one zero which is 10% so with the other formula you're doing 16 times point one zero which is 10 percent so with this one we're going to go ahead and we're going to add a 1 so it's one point one and we're going to divide instead of multiply so you're going to do 16 divided by 1.1 which is actually 14 point five four and then if you take the fourteen point five four times point 10% you actually get one point four five which is exactly 16 so that's gonna be the best formula to figure out exactly what you need to do for a 16 ounce container or 32 or whatever container you're putting it into and of course that works if you want to go up to 12% or drop it down to 8% so 1.7 four ounces of oil which comes out to exactly 16 ounces once again so let's go ahead and try that with a 20 ounce jar so if we wanted to fill this it was exactly 20 ounces worth so if we want to fill the 20 ounce container we're gonna take 20 divide it by 1.1 which will be our 10% and we're gonna get 18 point 1 and then of course if we want to get our 10% oil I amount out of that we're gonna multiply by 0.1 zero which comes out to 1.8 which is just under 19 obviously these go out a little further I didn't add those in there but it comes out to roughly 20 ounces all right so that's pretty much it I hope that one I hope I didn't gloss over anything I got to rewatch this video I was trying to keep everything together and kind of calculate everything to make sure I was coming up with all the right calculations with a calculator and on the chalkboard at the same time so I think I got everything covered pretty well in the the chalkboard demonstration and I won't know until I watch this back but that's pretty much it right there the formula is going to be you're gonna divide by the percentage that you want which is going to be 110 112 and then you're gonna break that down to one point one one point one two if you're doing 8% you're gonna do one point zero eight nine percent one point zero nine and you're actually going to come out with the exact amount of wax that you need to remove from 16 ounces or 20 ounces or whatever the container size is so that you can get the correct amount of oil in there now if you're doing something like 8 or 9 percent in the wax holds up to 12% this isn't a huge deal if you end up with more oil like if you actually did the 16 ounces weighed your oil and then you remove the wax and still had it you would bump up from 8 percent to like 9 percent or 9 and a half percent it's not gonna be a big deal because that wax can hold that but if you're doing a wax that has something like 12% and you actually add the 12% oil and then reduce it you're basically gonna up that to around 13 or 14% which could affect the candle and you could get a lot more seepage you could get a sweating and beating at the top of the candle so it's definitely something that you want to pay attention to and of course for those people who are getting down to exact measurements they know exactly what their candle holds and what they put in each of their candles this is definitely a formula that you want to pay attention to so huge thank you to Maria McDonald who posted the formula in the group I've always done it crazy ways and I've never even looked up the formula so it huge thanks to her for posting that in there the feedback on the last chalkboard video is really positive so I wanted to get a couple more of these out if you have something that you'd like to see a little bit more or basically something that goes into a little bit more detail like this please let me know in the comments down below and we'll try to add that to an upcoming video and again if I glossed over anything in the video or if something wasn't clear enough and I think I got everything but I haven't watched this part back yet so I want to go through and make sure that I covered everything if I didn't I'm gonna go ahead and throw some of the formulas up in the video so that you can see them but if I did gloss over something or you want something in more detail please let me know again in the comments down below and I'll try to go through answer every single one of them and I hopefully put it in another video and of course you can follow me on all the social media platforms listed down below my website Instagram Facebook my email address if you want to reach out to me and if you liked the video give it a thumbs up and thank you for watching", "WLuvgBvy3wk": "okay Bonnie are you still there I don't hear Bonnie anyway welcome everybody hear me there you go welcome everybody to the cooking show today I'd like to thank O'Neill for doing this for for us it gives us a little entertainment right it is entertainment well last week I talked a little bit about staying hydrated and I know it's the heat it's so very important that we do stay hydrated so today I've got my lemon water actually today so that adds just a little flavor and I will keep that in handy today as the heat gets hotter I think this weekend supposed to get warm so make sure plenty of water I'm glad you always remind us of that that actually leads me to the trip one the trivia questions and I'll mention this again at the end last week I had water do you remember what I had in my water and you remember what was on the water glass that I had if you remember those things just type it at the bottom or put it on O'Neal's Facebook page and we'll try to draw a winner that's a trivia question so enjoy your water oK we've got a big plate today today is we're celebrating fathers day and so this menu is going to be make a hand type of menu so that you can so that you can get everything made and enjoy Father's Day with your father your husband or whoever you have so this Sunday in the 21st I just want to mention my dad he was wonderful man he was a volunteer with the American Red Cross he was a volunteer fireman he was a great dad he was just wonderful he did pass away many years ago but I still remember him as being my superhero also I'd like to mention superhero father is my brother Mike Mike does it all and he's such a good guy and such a good father so shouts out to my brother Mike no that's a nice Becky thank you first thing we're going to do today is desserts first morning always dessert first we're going to do a strawberry pie so first thing you do is get a pie shell now I bought mine frozen and you bake it according the direction so it Browns and so I've got my pie shape hi she'll all date next thing I want to do is I'm going to take my nice kettle and I'm going to put I'm going to put 3/4 cup of sugar in my kettle and I'm going to put 3 tablespoons of cornstarch okay I want to take and stir that all together make sure you get that sugar and cornstarch all mixed together the next thing I'm gonna do I'm gonna slowly add a cup and a half of water and that'll you just take I've got a spatula and you just stir it till it's all mixed together you put that over a medium heat and you cook that until it starts to boil Susan starts to boil wait 1 minute stirring continuously you know what that will stick and so when you're done you end up with oh I forgot you put up after its boiled you take it off the heat and you put in a box of strawberry jell-o that's a 3 ounce box of strawberry jell-o just the powder you just dump it in so then you stir that for two minutes of the jello dissolves and you end up with this lovely red yummy yummy to that we're gonna mix 4 cups of strawberries now I'm clean and called these and I've actually sliced them because when I eat a strawberry pie I don't like those big bites of strawberry I like a little a little bite old piece so I'm gonna dump those in I made a cut a few extra you never have too many strawberries that's true very true okay I'm going to stir that up together oh this looks so good you guys can you see that yes I would like that's a lot easier than I ever thought it was that was like hours of baking and crap and all that but that was pretty easy this I'm gonna dump into my pie shell so look at this I think maybe I made too much okay yeah it looks really good look at that who cares if it overflows right yeah I don't okay as you can see it's a little sloppy so with this strawberry pie I put it in the refrigerator uncovered for about three hours just till that sets because it is a jello mix and it just sets so I'm gonna go ahead and stick this one in the refrigerator for June thank you baby you're very lucky June I am and there's one it's been in the refrigerator overnight so see it's nice and set well that was magic yep and then I got the wonderful ready of course so this is done it's in the refrigerator dad's gonna be over the moon over the strawberry pot okay today we are fixing of course the glazed strawberry pie we're doing the dill sour cream potato salad and we're doing oven-baked hot dogs I put together this menu and bought something's missing so I think it's baked beans so I went ahead and fixed some baked beans and I'll show you how I did that it's called the EZ ultimate baked beans and so I didn't cook them yet so we'll have to I'll have to cook them but I'll show you what I did look at this can you see this whoa you've got baked beans I can't baby it's the 28 ounce can of baked beans I got red onion I've got just a little garlic I've got the bacon which I cooked last night and crumbled up I've got mustard and ketchup and then to this I'm add two tablespoons of molasses doesn't everybody have way you've done that though I love the big skillet they suggested do it in a cast-iron skillet they said it just takes up nice so this is the first time I've done this like say I didn't bake them yet so we'll have to see how that looks she also you add two tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce so these are to be just wonderful I've got brown sugar in the middle I will add this recipe to the website I mean it's not on there right now but I'll have them put that out very good okay there we are look at that looks fabulous what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna stir it so in this lab a 28 ounce can of baked beans which I used Bush's baked beans I think they're the best but whatever you want to use and then I cooked up six slices of bacon and I let it cool and I crumbled it I added a half red onion I added 1/4 of a cup of ketchup and 1/4 of a cup of yellow mustard and 1/4 of a cup of brown sugar in the middle and then I had to well it calls for 2 tablespoons of garlic but as you all know my husband doesn't like garlic yes I put just a little a little bit of garlic Worcestershire sauce you just seen me put in 2 tablespoons and also molasses 2 tablespoons you could I thought about this when I was mixing this up you could switch this up a little instead of ketchup you could put barbecue sauce true a little bit different is there anything you can substitute from of the molasses you could probably just leave it out it just adds another depth to your baked beans I mean baked beans are good anyway put brown sugar on right well what about honey you could put a little honey yeah I have that I don't have molasses barbecue sauce that would help to look good I'm going to go ahead and get these in the oven now these won't be ready for the time we're done but I don't know if you can see look at how lovely those are can you see that yes ok next thing what's that morning taste it June said young a lead motor front porch in a bag the next thing we're gonna do is the dill sour cream potato salad does everybody like potato salad oh yes oh yes and I want to see I'm interested to see what you put in your potato salad because everyone does it differently okay because my mother used to make the best potato salad okay well the first thing is of course potatoes I used potatoes I just cleaned them up threw him in my boiling water hole and let him cook for about 15 or 20 minutes till they were soft and I got most of them cut up but it said to cut them in quarters but I think quarters were too big so I cut them I cut them up in eighth I don't like my potatoes great big in my potato salad so Bonnie what are you doing for Father's Day lastly my daughter and my son-in-law my grandkids are coming down from Cleveland and so we're gonna celebrate Father's Day here at my house for us for the kids and for the Greek it's nice June do you have any plans no I don't Becky come out here to help me celebrate okay I could do that hey Kelsey you guys have any plans okay there's my potatoes all cut up to this we're going to make a little dressing to go over your potatoes it calls for two tablespoons of chopped parsley let me tell you a little story about my parsley I made a nice big herb bed like a whiskey barrel and I can't keep the animals out of it my glob every day they dug it up personally I had growing it was up oh maybe that far and of course the animals got in there dug it all up and I no longer have dill so I put the parsley in there when you're using a dried herb versus a fresh herb there is a little ratio you need to go buy fresh herbs if it calls for two tablespoons which that's what that was supposed to be have quite two tablespoons if you're doing a dry herb the conversion is three to one so if it calls for one tablespoon of fresh dill since the animals got my deal instead I'll use one teaspoon of dried dill so it's 1 tablespoon to 1 teaspoon one tablespoon of fresh one teaspoon of dried so that I'll put in there one teaspoon to this I'm also going to add mayonnaise 2/3 of a cup of mayonnaise now in my house there's a big debate on mayonnaise or Miracle Whip like raise your hand no mayonnaise today we're using mayonnaise maybe I'll have to eat all this June oh no you said you would have some left over for me ok I put in 2/3 cup of mayonnaise to that I will add an 8 ounce carton which ends up being 1 cup of sour cream and that's where you that sounds good I've never put sour cream in my potato salad so just a little creamier a little tinier now remember we talked about the dill so instead of two tablespoons I'm gonna add two teaspoons because that's the difference when you're putting it dry I love fresh dill but I'll see if I can grow any more dude - so do your critters they must like I think just like digging it up okay - this - I'm going to add salt and pepper I'm going to add one teaspoon of salt and half a teaspoon of pepper and I've already got that measured out so I'm going to stir that up and it just makes a nice creamy dressing now they also call for a grated onion how much two tablespoons of grated onion I'm gonna go ahead and add that don't tell my husband I'll be watching later he gets a charge on me talking about him none of you can see this but some lovely lovely just lovely um in my bowl which is really big I'm going to add my potatoes to that I'm gonna add my my dressing so I'll just put that over top toss that together now you can serve this at room temperature like it is or you can go ahead and chill it I think I like my potato salad just a little chill what about you girls um I think I would prefer mine room-temperature just because room temperature I get chilled if I end with cold it make me old yeah that's true okay I need one more person in there I have to go out there see if I can get some more out there but there's my potato salad you can see that or not just a second let me tell you the taste any good that's yummy good okay I just kind of want to put my face in the bowl right now kind of like if we open our mouths will you put some in that's okay oh man that deal you can really taste that deal in there that is delicious course I'm on bill I think I need to drink water hydrate yourself I'm trying so we have our dessert done potato salad done the baked beans are baking and the last thing we got to do is an oven bake hot dog I have never tried these yet with your life so you're doing all of this ahead of time right so on Father's Day you don't have to cook well if you were really cooking it on Sunday on Father's Day it would be already I would what I would probably do if got people coming for lunch I probably get most all this done the day before like Saturday right so you don't have to worry about cooking on Father's Day right like the baked beans can be rewarmed it can be warmed up the hot dogs you don't have to be until it's time and then just stick them in the oven and then pull them out and they'll be warm right take thousands in the refrigerator chilling the strawberry pie is done and then you could well I just have such a good time with your family and friends okay this recipe calls for it's like a chili cheese dog and they suggested you always look down in the comments they suggest that this woof canned chili craigers actually had it which I was surprised it's an authentic Texas recipe a little spicy but it I think it's gonna make a good flavor with those hot dogs in the sauce and I can yep chili in a can again I'm using mayonnaise and you take your mayonnaise you open your hot dog bun you get a little mayonnaise on your night and then you just spread it on your bun I'm actually gonna spread on both sides because I like that okay and then two minutes you're gonna take some sweet pickle relish now my husband and I are big fans of pickle relish so I did have fun with pickle relish not without pickle relish and then you just spread one side with pickle relish yep I'd like epical do you and then what you're gonna do is you're gonna lay this in your in your dish and you're going to put your hot dog and it's a squeeze your hot dog and I did have to squish them so just I I like beef hot dogs I always use beef hot dogs so picking the hot dog in and to this we're going to add a little DeJohn mustard so you could use yellow mustard you can leave the mustard off but I think it'll add a nice step some red a little Dijon mustard it in there and then what I'll do is I'll go ahead and hot dogs let's say squish them in there get them nice and tight and then to the top of that I'm gonna add cheese all over the top and some onion now I left part of mine without onions you know who for let me show do you have to do something to the baking dish Becky bottom of the pan looks like hold the pan up from the bottom oh just a bunch of squished in there hot dogs yeah they say what it does is it actually crispy urbana so it makes it nice and crisp and the hot dogs are supposed to be cooked we'll see they put all the chili on there and you put all the cheese on there and you put onion on top on part of it there's three over here without relish or onions those are my husband gotcha well it is Father's Day give them give them something he wants today oh pretty good boy it's actually called shamrock okay it's green of course okay let me put one of these out I think the sinner ones will be the best but let me pull it edge one out there's your hot dog can you see that nice looks good potato salad and now my baked beans aren't quite done but we're going to put them on there anyway let's make it look pretty that's true Oh eat beans on curbs or cold or hot there we have it that's such a nice Father's Day lunch that's your fect yes looks like a picnic and that's a picnic this weekend's supposed to be really warm it'll be a nice day to take that outside with all the kiddos or go visit sons or grandson yes yes Bonnie do you have any stories about your father oh my goodness my father was a character for sure so we did a lot of stuff outdoors he was an outdoors kind of guy um he's been gone now for about 14 years so father's days always a little bittersweet but I have good memories of him and everything we did outside and my grandson's would have loved him had he still been here because he would teach them everything they needed to know about anything outdoors anything fishing anything hunting anything like that that's all that's what he did and I think maybe we all need just to remember those wonderful memories yes and he would have loved that big strawberry pie with lots of whipped cream biggest pie I've ever seen it's what the biggest pie I've ever seen biggest it's huge piece Wow he would love that well that's lunch actually that's lunch for me today and I remember my dad is like eat this I can't remember a thing my dad didn't like to eat so I grew I think that's true for me too yeah yeah yeah my dad was so sorry about your dad I'm gonna he was the opposite of Bonnie's he didn't do much outside he was president of the world's largest broom Factory back in the heyday and consequently I got to do a lot of fun traveling to New York Chicago all that fun stuff I always my daddy who the thing I remember he got a new car and it was a fast really fun car and he said I think you need to have an outfit that matches the car I was a bit spoiled I was and my sisters would agree but anyway he was daddy that's such a nice story I was kind of the oldest and I was kind of daddy's girl too so I'd get a little spoiled too it's fun isn't it it is fun except my brother and sister were jealous well that's they get over it if if they don't they're the ones who are suffering so that's right yes so anyway I was very blessed as I was - yes right and thankful for all the fun memories that we have now and I and I think those fatherhood memories of good men I think they may develop good sons and then they have developed good grandsons and I know junior family is all good kids and Bonnie yours too my family it's just been really good with a good dad that the solid foundation form really yes it is and we are very well yes we are very much next week we'll be back again live right Bonnie that's what I planned yes if you're gonna be here we will okay and next week's menu is going to be a sheet pan dinners you can take a sheet pan and make a whole dinner so it's gonna be really easy you pop it in the oven and it's gonna be really good we're gonna do a flight state with garlic roasted potatoes well I do a classic wedge salad and I like those oh oh yeah oh that's wonderful I may have to come there and record live with you next week I was going to say could we be in a live audience yeah that would be next week pressed against the window I would set it on the back porch but my critters would probably yeah oh don't let them have it no no no and as always Bonnie remember we need to stay hip healthy independent and productive and I just want to say thank you again for always making this fun Wednesday yes because we love to see you cooking and it's always fun to see what you come up with and it's healthy drinking your water not sure about the pie and you know all of that but it's true what it's good it's all strawberries don't berries are healthy and please eat that purse eat your dessert first I will this the Belpre Senior Center eat your dessert first my dessert first smell me okay so I got even better hurry you better hurry yeah well thank you again thank you thank you bye see ya happy song good week bye bye bye", "jOV3eW5vDcQ": "The shotgun world is a mess of old standards\n& notations, and nowhere is this more evident than the way we define bore diameters.\nJust about everyone is familiar with the terms - 12-gauge, 20-gauge, etcetera - but what\nexactly does gauge mean, and how does it translate to an actual diameter?\nWell, to answer that properly, we have to go way back.\nIn the Napoleonic era, cannons were commonly described by the weight of the shot used in\nthem. An iron cannon ball sized for a 12-pound gun, for example, would weigh 12 pounds - at\nleast in theory. Some of the smoothbore, muzzle-loading small\narms of the time adopted a similar notation, where their bore diameters were described\nby the number of matching lead balls that could be cast from a pound of lead. A musket\nfor which 12 round-balls could be made out of a pound of pure lead would be known as\na \u201cone-twelfth-of-a-pounder\u201d; or 12-gauge or 12-bore for short.\nThe math here isn\u2019t too complex. The mass of a ball is simply volume times\ndensity, and since the gauge is the number of balls per pound, it is equal to the reciprocal\nof the ball\u2019s mass in pounds. This lets you easily work out the gauge equivalent of\nany bore diameter if you know the density of lead.\nTo find diameter from gauge, simply rearrange the equation.\nIn addition to single projectiles, these old smoothbore firearms could be loaded with multiple\nsmaller shot if an application called for it, even if they weren\u2019t specifically designed\nas \u201cfowling pieces\u201d. While modern rifle barrels have seen significant technological\nadvancements and design changes since the smoothbore days, shotgun barrels have remained\nvirtually unchanged apart from some material and structural improvements, and are still\nusually defined by gauge today. With old muzzleloading shotguns, the gauge\ncould be pretty much anything the gunsmith or customer fancied. All that really needed\nto be sized to the bore were the wads, and most users simply cut those themselves.\nBut with the advent of self-contained, mass-produced shotshells, along with more complex breech-loading\nand repeating shotguns, ammo manufacturers and gunmakers began to focus on smaller numbers\nof standardized gauges. This trend continued as advancements in powders and components\nimproved and expanded shotshell capabilities across the board, and as a result, only a\nhandful of the most popular gauges remain in use today.\nThe largest you\u2019ll see on gun store shelves now is the 10-gauge, which has a theoretical\nbore diameter of .775 inches. Long since superseded by the 12ga as an all-around\nchambering, the 10ga lives on today primarily as a waterfowling gauge, since its big 3.5\u201d\nshells can hold large quantities of low-density, nontoxic shot. Though with its newer 3.5\u201d\nsuper magnum spec and improved nontoxic shot materials, the 12ga is no longer far behind.\nYou can also find buckshot, slugs, and heavy lead birdshot loads for the 10ga, but again,\nthese won\u2019t really let you do much you couldn\u2019t with a less bulky 12ga shotgun.\nThe 10ga is fine if you\u2019re into the novelty of the big shells, or you want a dedicated\nwaterfowling gun for use with steel shot. Otherwise, the 12ga can be about as effective,\nand is much more versatile and widely-available. Our formula spits out a standard diameter\nof .729 inches for the 12ga. Actual bore diameters can deviate from this, but they usually land\nbetween .725 and .735 inches. Since the early 1900s, the 12 has established\nitself as the leading all-purpose gauge, and is easily the most popular size in use today.\nIt\u2019s large enough to pattern well with just about any common shot size, and its typical\nlead shot payloads of between 1 oz and 1 \u00bc oz are very well-balanced for sporting, hunting,\nand combat alike. Because of the 12ga\u2019s popularity, light\nloads of 7/8 oz or less are also available, as are magnum loads of up to 1 7/8 ounces.\nThe higher-pressure 3.5\u201d 12ga super magnum introduced in the late 1980s can send 2 or\nmore ounces of lead downrange. Reloaders enjoy an enormous amount of support\nfor the 12ga, and no other chambering offers the same variety of factory buckshot, slug,\nand novelty loads; or such inexpensive and easy-to-find practice ammo.\nIf you want one gun that you can use for everything and always find ammo for, the 12ga is the\nclear winner. The 20ga shotshell, with its characteristic\nyellow hull, is also a very popular size. Both math and standard specs assign the 20ga\na bore diameter of .615\u201d. The standard 20ga birdshot load is 7/8 of\nan ounce of lead shot, though magnums can contain up to 1 \u00bc or 1 5/16 ounces. There\nare also a variety of 20ga slugs available for use in both smoothbore and rifled barrels,\nalong with buckshot loads suitable for personal defense and some hunting.\nThe 20ga\u2019s narrower bore leads to shells and guns that are noticeably more compact\nand easier to carry than 12ga equivalents, and its typically lighter payloads produce\nless recoil. This makes it very well-suited for most upland hunting, as well as an excellent\nchoice for younger or smaller-statured shooters. It\u2019s also an effective and family-friendly\nhome defense gauge. With the 20ga\u2019s reduced shell volume, it\ndoesn\u2019t perform as well as the 12 with large shot sizes or heavy payloads, and larger buckshot\npellets don\u2019t stack well in the narrower space. So it can\u2019t match the capabilities\nof the bigger and more versatile 12ga for certain things like waterfowl hunting or long-range\ntrap. Those applications aside though, the 20 is a very useful, capable, and popular\ngauge, a favorite of many shotgunners. Between the popular 12 & 20 gauges lies the\nmuch less prevalent 16-gauge, with a theoretical .663-inch bore diameter, though you may also\nsee it described as .662 or .665. As its gauge number suggests, the 16ga is\npractically tailor-made for a one-ounce shot load, but it also does well loaded down to\n7/8 of an ounce, or up to 1 \u00bc ounces. It can handle shot big enough to knock just about\nanything out of the air, and it\u2019ll even fit larger buckshot reasonably well.\nThe 16ga has a special place in the heart of many shotgunners, who view it as a \u201cgentleman\u2019s\ngauge\u201d of years past; the kind of shotgun the Most Interesting Man in the World would\nprobably use. More practically, a 16-gauge bore strikes a very nice balance between the\nversatility of the 12ga and the compact size of the 20, and it was a very widely-used small-bore\ngauge up until the 20ga overtook it in the 1970s. There are a number of reasons for its current status, including the absence of a 16ga skeet\nclass, competition from the 3\u201d 20ga introduced in the 1950s, and its limited capacity for\nlow-density nontoxic shot. But a more fundamental issue is that with\nmodern components and loads, there really isn\u2019t much of a niche for the 16ga in its\ncurrent form. Looking purely at shot size and payload weights, a 2.75\u201d 16ga load won\u2019t\ndo anything that a 12ga or magnum 20ga couldn\u2019t. And on top of that, ammo companies and gunmakers\nseem to have pretty much given up on the 16ga. It still hasn\u2019t received the 3\u201d magnum\nspec it needs to be a competitive multi-purpose chambering, and many current- and recent-production\n16ga shotguns from major manufacturers are simply under-bored 12ga designs with no weight\nor size advantages. The 16ga isn\u2019t dead yet though, and while\nit\u2019s not as popular as it once was, it is still a very well-balanced gauge, and there\nare a lot of older 16ga shotguns still in circulation. If you\u2019re in possession of\none of these \u201csweet sixteens\u201d, you can still find a wide enough variety of birdshot,\nbuckshot, and slugs to hunt most game, and any gaps can easily be filled by reloading.\nWhat the 20ga is to the 12, the 28-gauge is to the 20.\nThe 28ga has a bore diameter of .55 inches. Typical loads contain \u00be of an ounce of birdshot,\nbut you can also find some heavier loads of 7/8 or one ounce. Shot sizes up to #4 are\navailable, though the wider 20ga would tend to handle #6 and larger shot better. Slugs\nexist for the 28-gauge, but they\u2019re not too common; and if you want buckshot you\u2019ll\nprobably need to handload it. Really though, if you want slugs, buckshot,\nand heavy 1-ounce payloads, you might as well just go with the 20ga. The little 28 is at\nits best as a soft-shooting upland and skeet gauge. Purpose-built 28-gauge shotguns can\nbe even lighter and trimmer than 20-gauges, but they\u2019ll still dust clays and kill birds\ncleanly with a little skill. It probably wouldn\u2019t be a great choice for\nnew shotgun owners since 20ga shells are easier to find, less expensive, and more versatile.\nBut the little 28 has a healthy following among experienced shotgunners, and it isn\u2019t\ndifficult to see why. The smallest common shotshell size is the\n.410, which is a bit of an oddity. As you might have guessed from the preceding decimal\npoint, this isn\u2019t a gauge, it\u2019s a caliber. .410 shotguns have bore diameters of .41 inches,\nwhich is roughly 67 \u00bd-gauge. The standard load for the 2 \u00bd\u201d .410 is\njust half an ounce of birdshot, while 3\u201d shells can contain 11/16 or \u00be of an ounce\nof shot. Birdshot sizes up to #4 are available, though anything larger than typical target\nshot doesn\u2019t tend to pattern well. .410 slugs are very lightweight, typically 1/5\nor \u00bc of an ounce. The .410 is not a terribly versatile chambering,\nbut it does have some uses. With just a paltry half-ounce of shot on tap, breaking clays\nbecomes quite the challenge, and there\u2019s a special .410-only skeet class. It is also\nuseful for close-range pest control, and the very small size and light weight of .410 shells\nand guns has led to their frequent inclusion in emergency survival kits.\nSome consider .410s to be good youth guns, and many a lifetime shotgunner got their start\nwith a simple .410 single-shot. However, others argue that the .410\u2019s minuscule payloads\nand thin shot patterns are more likely to just frustrate beginners, and a similar shotgun\nin a larger gauge would be a better and more useful choice for most young shooters.\nMore controversial than that though, is the idea of the .410 as a defensive cartridge.\nRecent years have seen the introduction of a number of .410 firearms marketed as self-defense\npieces, as well as a plethora of new .410 buckshot and slug loads intended for use in\nthose guns. Those who fancy the .410 as a defensive chambering\noften do so under the idea that since it\u2019s a shotshell, it must pack the punch of a shotgun.\nI explained in the previous video in this series how buckshot\u2019s legendary stopping\npower is all about quantity over quality. Well, the .410 can\u2019t really offer that quantity;\na load of .410 buckshot is about equivalent to a few FMJs from a small-caliber pocket\npistol. While that that could be an effective stopper (at least at close range, before the\ndeformed pellets have a change to spread), it doesn\u2019t really compare to the power of\neven non-magnum buckshot loads from a full-sized shotgun.\nBut while an argument could be made for .410 buckshot, .410 slugs don\u2019t offer much in\ncomparison to other pistol rounds. Despite their size, they only weigh about as much\nas .380 ACP bullets, and are far less advanced than the jacketed hollowpoints used in modern\ndefensive handgun ammunition. If you\u2019re thinking of getting a .410 for use primarily\nwith slugs, you\u2019d probably be better-served by a similar firearm in a more conventional\ncartridge. Well, that about wraps up the modern shotshell\noptions. Virtually all current-production shotguns are chambered in one of these six\ngauges. However, there are a few other gauges that\nstill see some use today. Two of these are the 24-gauge and the 32-gauge,\nwhich perform similarly to the 28-gauge. There are a number of old 24- and 32-gauge shotguns\nstill taking game or breaking clays, and components and even loaded shells are available to feed\nthem. On the other end of the size scale is the\nold 8-gauge. Though long since rendered obsolete for hunting, it currently has some industrial\napplications, and there are still working 8ga guns in the hands of collectors, so\nsources exist for 8ga ammo and components. Finally, there are the really rare shotshell\nsizes that are no longer used, but are still studied and collected by hobbyists.\nThese include the experimental 14ga Winchester toyed with introducing in the 1960s, \u201cgarden\ngun\u201d shells even smaller than the .410, 4-gauge and larger punt gun shells, and a\nwhole bevy of other oddball gauge, inch, and metric sizes.\nBut unless you\u2019re a big collector, these six sizes are what you\u2019ll be dealing with\nas a shotgun owner today. Hopefully this video was a good introduction\nand overview for these. If you\u2019re here trying to decide what gauge to get into and you still\nhave questions, I\u2019ll be happy to answer them as best I can.\nGenerally though, for new shooters, I\u2019d recommend the 12 gauge as a solid do-everything\nshotgun; the 20 if you want something a bit lighter and softer-shooting for home defense,\nskeet, or upland hunting; and the .410 for plinking, an ultralight survival gun, or maybe\na starter shotgun for younger kids who can\u2019t quite handle a 20.\nUntil next time, please have fun and shoot safely and responsibly.", "_D1XfyF2ZQ8": "all right kiddos we're gonna work through lesson eight five and maybe eight six we'll see they're very very similar so we're gonna kind of talk about both today because we should be able to get through both of them pretty quickly it is still using those customary units now so it's no longer the metric units remember the metric units were the by tens hundreds thousands which was nice and easy customary units are a little different what we did last time was the foot inches and yards and miles where they're all kind of funky different numbers we're going to be looking at today has to do with liquid weight mass and weight as the two things were kind of kind of look at today if we do both lessons we get just two one then we'll just be one of them but we're still doing that same step if we're going from a bigger unit to a smaller unit we're multiplying if we're going from a smaller unit to a bigger unit we're dividing okay it's the same concept no matter what you're converting with our measurements okay so same idea it's bigger to smaller you're gonna multiply smaller to bigger you're gonna divide guys so same idea so let me share our screen and we can get going on some of our math here all right like I said we are working with liquid volume first this is things like quarts gallons cups planes okay they are all different measurements which is very difficult sometimes your smallest unit of measurement is cups it takes two cups to make one pint four cups to make two points sixteen cups to make eight pints it takes eight pints or sorry it takes two pints to make one quart and it takes four quarts to make one gallon so what they do kind of funky with our liquid measurements especially here in the United States and stuff because we're the only ones who use these we do these funky fractions I know none of us really care for our fractions but that is one of the funky things that they do for us with our liquid measurement and if you look down here with our weight it's going to be fractions of both of these so they show it a little bit for you one pint is half of a quart which is 1/8 of a gallon and 1/4 of a gallon is 1 quart so it's a little confusing but we can figure it out so what fraction of one gallon is 3 quarts well if one quart is 1/4 we just have to multiply that by 3 and so if I have 1 4 times 3 remember we just put that 300 over a 1 multiply across the top and the bottom which would give us 3/4 okay what fraction of one quart is one pint well they showed this one one pint equals one half of a  so they gave us that one which is kind of nice again I would write down this chart that's up here to help you on your lessons and everything what fraction of one quart is one cup so if it takes two cups to make one pint which is half of a quart half of a pint or one cup is only going to be 1/4 of a quart here's how you can figure that out you have to take that 1/2 and that equals two cups and it's that monkey thing where it's half of this you want half of half of 1/2 so you cannot apply it by another 1/2 which would give us 2 times 2 is 4 1 times 1 is 1 okay it's 1/2 of 1/2 which is the really confusing cards I don't particularly like what they do with the fractions here because I think it's way too confusing but it's how we do a lot of our stuff what fraction of one gallon is 3 pints so if one pint is one eighth of a gallon three pints is going to be 3/8 of a gallon okay it's that simple conversions you're just multiplying it'd be the same idea as we did up here with the multiplying okay 12 quarts equals how many cups well 1 quart equals 4 cups so this one I'd have to do 12 times 4 because I'm going from a larger to a smaller which 12 times 4 if we know our math facts is just 48 104 pints equals how many gallons well we know 8 pints equals 1 gallon so we have to take that 104 and divide it by 8 8 goes into 10 once when I said x 1 times 8 is 8 I subtract I get to bring down my 4 8 goes into 24 three times which is 20 or sorry a little messy this morning and gives me 0 so it takes it makes 13 gallons because remember I'm going from a smaller to larger so I'm dividing and that's all we're doing with these so hardest part is always going back and looking at these different conversions I don't these ones I don't even have memorized all the way I know how many cups are in a pint and pints in a quart in quarts in a gallon but I don't have how many cups are in a quart I'd have to go backwards myself so do your best with these what I would suggest is writing this down pause the video write this down so that you have it in notes for when you're working on your lessons so it's easier to find 20 cups equals how many quarts well 16 cups equals 4 quarts 4 cups equals 1 quart so 4 cups equals one quart we take the 20 cups and divide it by 4 4 times 1 equals 20 well that's 5 4 times 5 equals 22 gallons equals how many plain well one gallon equals eight pints so I just do 8 times 2 which is 16 15 quarts equals how many cups well like we said one quart equals four cups so we have to do 15 times when we say 4 4 I know this off the top of my head because I know how to tell time but we'll work it out 2 4 times 5 is 20 4 times 1 is 4 plus 2 is 6 so it is 6 tea cups same idea as we've been doing with all of our other conversions with smaller to larger you multiply or larger to smaller you multiply smaller to larger you divide 3 cups equals how many pints well 2 cups equals 1 pint so 3 cups is going to be one and a half pints because you only have enough for a half a pint there okay this is where they're throwing those fractions at you how many gallons does 8 48 quarts equal well 4 quarts equals 1 gallon so if I do 48 divided by 4 hmm let's look they kind of show us up here already just with other measurements it is 12 gallons okay so same idea going all the way through it's pretty simple so we're gonna actually stop right there with those and we're gonna look at some of these word problems remember they are multi-step which means you have to do more than one thing we'll do at least the first two and then we'll see about looking at our next lesson just so that we can get both done because I know we're behind today so a muffin recipe requires 2 and 3/4 cups of milk okay so we know that we need that cups what amount of milk do you need to make double the number of muffins well first we'd have to do our 2 and 3/4 twice so I could do 2 and 3/4 multiplied by 2 or plus 2 and 3/4 so I'm just gonna plus because we haven't done a lot of that lately alright I'm gonna do my fractions first 3/4 plus 3/4 is 6/4 which is more than a whole so I know I need four fourths of those 6/4 to make one whole so if I take four fourths away from 6/4 I have two fourths left and I regrouped one so if I do this 3 plus 3 gives me 6 fourths I'm taking away 4 fourths cuz that makes one whole that I can regroup with my whole numbers oops and I would have just two fourths left over so this 2/4 comes down here this 4 fourths changes to one whole up top then I have 1 plus 2 which is 3 plus 2 which is 5 so it would be 5 and 2/4 but I'm gonna simplify that it's going to be 5 still but that 2/4 can change to 1/2 so it's going to be 5 and 1/2 cups ok pretty simple if you really look at it we know how to add our fractions we did this a long time ago we know how to simplify our fractions and regroup them stuff we've all done which is nice that's what our last units here do is they use all the things we've learned throughout the whole year and how they work with the world just kind of nice to see because a lot of times we see noble why does that matter it would really matter to know how to convert between doubling recipes and stuff like that if you are wanna be a chef or you want to bake also sometimes you'll have to do a half a recipe or a quarter recipe that's where it's really important to know how to do all of it - all right let's look at this one again we're looking at a recipe ok recipe requires 3/4 cup of water fair has a measuring cup that is marked only in ounces but she knows that eight ounces is equivalent to one cup how many ounces of water will she add to the mixture explained well if one cup equals eight we can take eight and divide it by four to figure out how many one-fourth it's so if I have eight ounces of water I'm going to divide it by fourths so I'm going to divide it by four to figure out how much one-fourth is well we know 4 goes into 8 two times so 1/4 of a cup so 1/4 of a cup is equal to two ounces okay but we want three-fourths of a cup so we simply have to take that 2 and multiply it by three which would give us six so he needs where she needs sorry 6 ounces to get 3/4 of a cup pretty using really will do one more okay a serving size of pineapple orange punch is half a cup Liam needs to make seventy two servings of punch he will use 8 pints of pineapple juice the rest is orange juice how many pints of orange juice does he need to make the punch first we have to figure out how many 1/2 cups 72 servings is so if we do 72 times one half will tell us how many cups we need and then we can figure out pints so if I have 72 and I'm multiplying it by 1/2 I can also just divide it by 2 2 goes into 7 3 times which is 6 bringing out my 1 now it's 12 2 times 6 equals 12 which would give me 0 so I know he needs 36 cups okay not the pints yet we're at 36 cups now let's look up here two cups equals one pint so we're gonna divide it by two again to figure out how many pints we need so we're gonna take the 36 and divide it by two those in two goes into 3 one time I subtract 3 minus 2 is 1 bring down my 6 2 goes into 16 eight times which is 16 and then I end up with 0 so we know then that there are 18 pints if he's using 8 pints of pineapple juice and the rest is orange juice I would take my 18 and just subtract that 8 to figure out how many pints of orange juice he needs 18 minus 8 is simply 10 so he needs 10 pints of orange juice okay so 10 times it's a process to find all of your answers but it is a good one to go through all right let's look at 8 6 since we have some time and it's very similar to what we just did so the nice thing with weight is we look at bounces pounds and tons and that is it but we look at it all as fractions which is a little confusing so one pound is 16 ounces one ton is 2,000 pounds you're still doing your larger to smaller multiply and your smaller to larger device that doesn't change but we have to look at these if I have one ounce I have one sixteenth of a pound because there are 16 ounces in a pound five two ounces I have one eight because two goes into 16 eight times I would reduce to that I have four ounces it's 1/4 of pound because if I write it as the four sixteenths let's check which I could easily do because that's how many ounces I'm using four of the 16 4 goes into 4 one time or goes into 16 4 times this is our simplifying that we did a long time ago so this would be the same as 1/4 of a pound 8 is half of 16 so 8 ounces would would be one half of a pound 12 ounces is going to be 12 is 3 times 4 oops so it's a it would simply be 3 whoops ah 3/4 oh I know that's confusing that's why I really don't like how we do our pounds I prefer the metric weighting system but we do what we got to do so one ton equals 2,000 pounds if I have 4 tonnes I have to do 4 times 2,000 which 4 times 2 is 8 and then I just add my comment and 3 zeroes for 8,000 ok I have 144 ounces I want to know how many pounds we know it's 16 ounces equals 1 pound I have to take my 144 and divide it by 16 you'll notice 16 doesn't go into 14 so we just have to kind of know this one we can make a few guesses if I do say 6 times what that ends with a 4 I'm gonna try 9 because 6 times 9 equals 54 so if I put down my 4 regroup my 5 9 times 1 is 9 plus 5 is 14 so that was a good guess doesn't always work that's a way sometimes we have to erase and try again so this one is nine pounds again that's why our units of measurement are a little bit more confusing they're not as cut dry as the tens hundreds thousands ours are all funky numbers which is a little frustrating so 64 ounces equals how many pounds well we know 15 times 4 is 60 we did that earlier so 16 times 4 is going to be 64 so this is gonna be 4 pounds how many tons are into 10,000 pounds well 10 divided by 2 is 5 so there are 5 tonnes 11 times equals how many pounds well 11 times 2 equals 22 but then I have to put my thousands behind it 16 pounds equals how many ounces well we have to do 16 times 16 6 times 6 equals 36 6 times 1 is 6 plus 3 is 9 and my 0 as my place holder 1 times 6 is 6 1 times 1 is 1 add them together 6 plus 0 is 6 9 plus 6 is 15 1 plus 1 is 2 so this one would be 256 ounces you see why I don't particularly like these because they're all funky numbers and I have to do a little bit extra work so we'll stop there for now and we'll look at these needs ISTEP problems 1/4 pound package of sunflower seeds cost 79 cents an 8 ounce package cost $1 59 which package represents the lower cost per ounce well we know that 1/4 of a pound is equal to let's look at our thing 4 ounces so this is four ounces ounces is represented as oszi okay not equals the 79 cents then I know eight ounces it's a dollar fifty nine so if I take my dollar fifty nine I'm gonna divide it by eight to figure out how much each ounce costs so remember bring up my decimal so I don't forget it eight does not go into one so I'm gonna put a little X to hold in my spot eight goes into fifteen but only one time fifteen minus eight is seven bring down the nine eight goes into 70 nine nine times which is 72 I subtract nine minus two is seven I could add a zero here let's make this look like a nun there we go and bring it down and it's gonna go in eight times which is 64 and we're just gonna get stuck and kind of this never-ending number loop unfortunately so we're gonna stop there so with the eight ounces it's nineteen point eight cents almost 20 cents an ounce that's quite a bit now let's look at the seventy nine divided by four remember this is seventy nine cents which means there is a decimal at the beginning here four goes into 7 one time when I subtract I get three bring down my nine four goes into 39 nine times which is 36 I subtract I get three I'm gonna add a zero just to see what one is slightly less thirty four goes into thirty seven times which is twenty eight so if we look at this they're just barely barely barely barely different so technically the quarter pound the one quarter pound package is cheaper they are almost equal though they're very close to being equal which is a bit crazy so they're almost equal but just barely the four ounces is less all right let's look at this next one we have Melissa this is why it's important guys to when you're dividing make sure though that you add those zeros and bring them down when you can or when you need to because every but every one of these is a little different okay it's important to know all those steps and remember all that with our division I know it's hard to remember sometimes but we will get there all right Melissa is measuring 132 ounces of rice in two one-pound containers how many one-pound containers will she need to hold all of the rice how many ounces of rice will she need to buy if she needs ten pounds of rice okay so first let's do the first one no she has 132 ounces of rice and she wants to break them into one pound pieces well 1 pound is the same as 16 ounces so we're going to take that 132 and divide it by 16 well again 16 doesn't go into the 1 or the 3 so it can't go into the 13 so 16 goes into 132 well let's see sick times let's try seven six times seven equals 42 7 times 1 is 7 plus 4 is 11 nope not quite what we need it is not that one so we're gonna try eight let's see it's okay to be wrong with your guesses I knew right away because I knew 32 minus 22 was gonna be 10 or sorry 32 minus 12 was gonna be 20 so I knew that was more than 16 so I'm gonna do 8 8 times 6 equals 48 done your 8 regroup your 4 8 times 1 is 8 plus 4 is 12 see much closer to what we wanted it to be cannot take 8 from two so I cross out that 3 make it a 2 this 2 becomes a 12 12 minus 8 equals 4 so she needs eight containers but she actually needs nine containers cuz she wants to hold all of the rice so I don't want to leave four ounces sitting to the side so she needs nine containers okay but now how many ounces of rice will she need to buy if she needs 10 pounds of rice so she's got 8 pounds and 4 ounces well we know she's gonna need at least one more pound so that would put her to 9 pounds and 4 ounces so if I take 16 ounces and I subtract 4 I will have 12 ounces so she needs 1 pound and 12 ounces to get to that 10 pounds of rice because she already has eight pounds four ounces so we'd add one whole one that'd be nine pounds four ounces to get from the four ounces to the 16 ounces that are at a pound you'd have to add 12 ounces okay it's a process we'll do one more and then we'll be done a casserole recipe calls for four ounces of cheese Adrienne wants to use half the amount of cheese and his casseroles how many pounds of cheese does he need to make twenty-eight casseroles with his revised recipe well first of all half of the four ounces simply means 4 divided by 2 which is 2 so we know it's 2 ounces in each casserole and he wants to make 28 casseroles so we're gonna do 28 times the two ounces 2 times 8 is 16 2 times 2 is 4 plus 1 is 5 so he needs 56 ounces we want to change those ounces to pounds so we have to do 56 divided by 16 we'll do 3 times 3 times 6 is 18 3 times 1 is 3 plus 1 is 4 and we'll subtract that cannot take 8 from 6 so I have to regroup that 16 becomes or 6 becomes a 16 16 minus 8 is 8 so it's 3 pounds right and it's eight ounces though which is a half a pound so three and a half pounds which this one actually up here reminds me we should write this as 1 and 3/4 pounds but they wanted once's how many ounces of rice which you need to buy 12 plus ah 16 would be I didn't read the from all the way see it's important to read problems all the way so this top one up here we got wrong it was 12 ounces was what was left over that she need plus 16 so 12 plus 16 is 28 so she would need 28 ounces so I apologize I didn't read that one all the way this one is three and a half pounds there we go so we have do you have to pay attention to your word problems otherwise you'll get the answer wrong all right so we're gonna end here for 8 - 6 so remember this is 8 - 6 + 8 - 5 go ahead and work on both in our think central and you'll have 8 - 7 tomorrow so make sure you're remembering if I'm going from a larger unit to a smaller unit and multiplying if I'm going from a smaller unit to a larger unit I'm dividing that's how what we're going to do with all of these types of problems", "sg44jDOL8jo": "[Applause] hey everyone ten outdoors nine and today we're testing some 12-gauge this is the Winchester P DX 112 defender two to three quarter inch shell 1,150 feet per second remember that number we're going to come back to that as a reference point in just a moment for those who choose to prefer loading their home defense shotgun with slugs or buckshot this gives you the best of both worlds here's a cutaway and is two and three-quarter inch shell our payload is a 1 ounce foster slug but in front of that you're going to have 3 double-aught buckshot and notice that those are copper plated now packed in between all of that is this matter known as grex GRE X these are plastic granules and this product and it is a product is designed to give you tighter patterns with regard to the velocity 1150 feet per second out of a two and three-quarter inch shell a slug by itself is going to be cranking along in the neighborhood of fifteen to sixteen hundred feet per second and double-aught buckshot in the vicinity of 1,200 to 1,300 feet per second so we're giving up this velocity because of this extra payload in a two and three-quarter inch shell now the pattern itself this represents a four inch group or pattern at 15 feet home defense distance this is what Winchester is saying we are going to see now we're going to do this in just a moment at ten feet so it's going to be a little bit tighter or at least it should be and also these positions ten two and six to seven o'clock we are supposed to be able to see that as well due to this design now at forty to forty-five yards Winchester is saying that this pattern will spread out to approximately fifteen inches the purpose of those opening shots was to show two things one the recoil which is it bad and two the spread or pattern that we have at approximately forty yards now typically I'm not going to shoot one ounce foster slugs even out of a two and three-quarter inch shell at less than 100 yards on two ar500 steel because it will crater I've done that at about sixty yards and I'm not going to do that again so I know it for a fact did not have a problem with these it did not crater it just simply shattered and I took that chance because I knew we had a much lower velocity and we didn't have any problem with that now the pattern what I'm thinking happened here is that this slug carried this pellet that's at ten and a half inches and this one at eight and this one is at twelve senator Center measured from this impact I think this impact of the slug brought that pellet which is at about seven seven and a half inches and this hit didn't put any pellets on there so we put nine pellets downrange and for our own and IPSC target my point with this is it relative to self-defense it's about someone who might try to use this or consider using this for hunting and you do whatever you want the slug is going to be accurate that's fine but they're not going to pack the punch that a typical slug and a two and three-quarter inch shell is going to be carrying by itself and you're really not getting that much of a benefit at this distance with the pellets themselves oh we got a draw I recall correctly this is the first time the block has completely left the table and taking a dirt nap that's exactly what's going on it's a dirt nap because of all the days I chose not to put a tarp on the ground or a drop cloth this is what happens I'm going to get this back up on the table and give you a closer view of the damage there also the pattern at this distance I know you're really interested in that as am i but I want to show you this first because we're going to lose this perspective when I do so that is one of the pellets and that penetrated about 18 inches in fact they would have come all the way out had it not been for the board stopping it so that was a concern of mine I did not see anything out the back that whole by the way that's where I calibrate the BBS I'll shoot those all into one of the lower corners and extract that section to confirm the calibration hey kids introducing the chia pet ballistic gel block hours of fun for the entire family available at fine craft stores everywhere check out that mess and that's going to need a really good cold shower before I get this anywhere near ready for recycling okay let's check out the good stuff the pattern that's at 10 feet with the ball spur 20 inch barrel and just a standard choke Center to Center from each of these pellet openings is two and a quarter inches you can see pretty much a perfect triangle around that massive opening which is the slug obviously and that sound like matter you see on the front of the block is that grex the buffer so let's take this indoors get it cleaned up and start the dissection I'm working with multiple elements here so we're going to have to break this into a few segments and we're testing handgun calibers in this format we typically see a path or track here that's an inch to maybe an inch and a quarter wide okay got that let me zoom in a little bit this is the three inch depth mark right there and this is about seven so let's focus on this area this four inch area right here check out this cavity that's not all of it that's the rest of it underneath there this cavity is approximately four four and a half inches wide got this on the tripod let's zoom in the damage was caused by the slug no doubt about that just that the volume the mass and the energy behind it but if you look closely right here that's a path of one of the pellets and also right here that's a path of another pellet and they are not going in a straight line next just a quick view of the left side of the blog just to illustrate I capture the greatest majority of that cavity on the other side I lost this track at about seven or eight inches because the slug when it went in made a really sharp turn to the right more on that right now here's that big cavity again back to the right side of the block there's a lot of paper other things brought in from the shell now we're at an interesting point here we're at the ten eleven inch depth mark when we have tested foster slugs in this media in this format well before this point they have disintegrated and the pieces have gone their separate directions that has not happened here not yet or will it happen 14 15 16 17 and this turned out to be more of a 21 inch block than 20 inches and we've got something working down in there that is the slug and it appears to be intact and given the actual length of this block that leading edge you can see it turned is coming in at about 19 and a half inches and from this perspective no fragmentation pellet update and I'm referring to the pellets based on their position in the pattern so we found the five o'clock pellet at 18 inches on the bottom of the block and we have another one that left this is the one o'clock pellet it exited the top of the block at 11 and a half inches so it's also off the grid and finally pellet number three this is the left side of the block now it spent much time there pellet came in that's the eight o'clock pellet parallel with the slug slug ventured off to the right this pellet took off like a rocket headed toward the top back corner of the block and there it is at 19 and a half inches slug has had a warm bath everything is nice and clean I have weighed this three times and I keep coming in at one point zero zero two ounces you there's no denying that massive amount of energy transfer that we saw in the first seven or eight inches of this block but we're going to get that with twelve-gauge concentrated buckshot loads and of course slugs as well we've seen that so far in this testing this is where it comes down to I think as the penetration that happened after that initial cavity all that trauma and so forth I do not use a slug in my home defense gun however if I did I would choose something that has a higher velocity and a much better chance of fragmentation we've seen that happen with regard to buckshot I do use double op buckshot for my home defense load but I do not use plated buckshot because of what we had a tendency to see here to me this plated buckshot resembled a full metal jacket in a handgun test where it just keeps on going so I think that's where this comes down to in spite of all the other aspects we saw about this concept which is interesting but that's just how I feel about it looking forward to your comments and just ask everyone to please be civil with each other thanks for watching", "3alDNC-DNBI": "hello everyone I'm Jeff Stanley was Stanley handcrafted and today we're gonna be talking about wax and weighing it and basically getting it into jars a question that comes up a lot and it's one that popped up again that Shawn and I were talking about the other day and that is when you're filling the candles and a lot of the tutorials that I do I use the 8 ounce jelly jar which is a really common jar and then of course pretty much any of the waxes we're using kind of one pound as the base for everything for the oil is just the mixing the weighing and pouring into different jars and the question that comes up a lot is the one pound of wax fits into three of the eight ounce of jelly jars which is this one right here and of course everybody's first question is how does 16 ounces fit into 3 8 ounce jars that would be 24 ounces and that's what this video is gonna be right here we're gonna go into exactly why 16 ounces of wax is gonna fill 3 of these jars now first off you're gonna see that the jar isn't actually full all the way so eight ounces would be clear to the top so if you did have three jars full completely to the top you're looking at right around like 24 ounces so we're actually going down just a little bit more so you're only putting I don't know I'd probably say like eighty-five ninety percent of the of the jars being full so you're gonna knock that down just a little bit more but that still doesn't take into take into the fact that you're only adding 16 ounces of wax but a lot of people forget that you're also adding a little bit of oil which kind of bumps that up a little bit so you're gonna be using 16 ounces of wax and then with the Paris Oi you're gonna be using right around 1.2 to 1.3 ounces of oil which is gonna bump that up to about 17 point two 17.3 but again that still doesn't add up to around kind of 20 21 22 ounces to fill those three jars and that's when we get into another area that a lot of people don't think about and something else that I kind of wanted to talk about too and that's because the wax actually has more volume than say something like water so a lot of people when they get into candles they don't know how much it lacks to add to a particular jar so a lot of people recommend adding water to a jar and basically seeing how much you need so basically a lot of people will get in and they'll fill this jars who right about this point they'll see the exact ounces that they need for water they'll take into a little bit of consideration for the oil that's going to go into it maybe get down a little bit and then of course when you weigh out that much wax and then you pour it into these you end up with a lot more wax than you thought of you end up with a lot more wax than you actually calculate it for and that's because wax is larger by volume than water is and what I mean by that is 16 ounces of water if you measure that into a measuring cup it's going to hit the 16 ounce mark if you measure 16 ounces of weighed wax and then you melt it down and then you pour that into the same measuring cup you're actually going to get a lot more than the 16 ounce line with the water so we're gonna go ahead and just jump right into the video I've already melted some and I'm just gonna show you the video of basically doing the water weighing it out showing it in the measuring cup and then weighing the wax melting it and then pouring it back into the measuring cup all right so we've got 16 ounces of wax solid form we're gonna go ahead and melt that down to see what it looks like in liquid form once you pour it into this to see the difference between 16 weighed ounces and 16 volume ounces and while we're waiting for that I've got some water right here so we're gonna go ahead and weigh out 16 ounces [Music] that's around 16.4 so just a little bit over but you can see that it's right at the 16 ounce mark it's actually just under a little bit so it aboard it exactly 16 ounces and then we're gonna go do the same thing with the wax all right so this is fully melted and this is 16 ounces exactly from what we made earlier I'm going to zero this out and then we're just going to go ahead and pour this in [Music] and you can see exactly what I was going for 15.8 there's too still a little bit of wax in there I'll try to get it back to 16 that's good enough but the point is that is why you measure by weight not volume so you can see the water of course it was sixteen point four and it was right at the 16 mark the wax at fifteen point nine is almost at twenty fluid ounces so that's the big reason why you always so that right there is exactly why you're always gonna measure and test in your glasses okay so you can clearly see that the wax there there is a lot more wax than there is water and that's where a lot of people get into trouble they do a lot of these jars they'll fill them up and when they go to do like six jars or something like that if you're weighing out like two pounds you end up with almost almost another full jar with wax that's left over that you didn't calculate for so that's why measuring with water is not a great idea it's always best to start with 1 pound of wax melt it down and then just pour it into jars and if you're under or over you can kind of you can adjust for that you can add an extra jar add a little bit more wax if you do have a little bit of extra wax I usually just pour it into a melt like these right here if I have extra wax especially when I'm doing the first couple batches and I'm trying to measure out how much wax is gonna go into like two or three of the nine ounce straight jars the tumblers or anything like that I know to start with a pound and I'll see how many jars I get out of that in anything left over I just pour straight into melts and then turn around and sell these but that still leaves the other question that a lot of people have and that is how does 16 ounces of wax and of course bumping it up with the oil and everything like that seventeen point three ounces of total wax weight and oil weight fit into three jars and basically that's going to come down to this so you're looking at a total of around seventeen point to seventeen point three if you divide that by three jars which it fits into you're gonna come out to just under six ounces so you're actually putting about six ounces of wax and oil into each jar so you're not actually getting a full eight ounces in the eight ounce jelly jar and then of course the reason that looks so full is because again you saw in the video that the wax there's a lot more volume than there is the water by weight so you saw that there's 20 ounces of basically volume so if you're gonna go by volume of wax it went up to the 20 ounce line so getting that much more wax it's gonna even though it weighs less you're gonna fill more of the jar so if you were to fill 6 ounces of water in this thing it would be a lot less than this so that's where a lot of people get into trouble with this one and I definitely did it in the beginning I just didn't even think about wax and water weighing the same or having the same volume and I made the same mistake I would basically go through I measured a couple jars and then of course I ended up with so much extra wax that I just couldn't figure it out and then of course like thinking about it a little bit actually going back to like high school science it finally made sense on why it did that so like I said getting into new jars anything like that and how do you weigh them out how do you figure out the wax I just go for a pound you can you can you can get away with a few other ways to do it too if you have like a 12 ounce jar you know it's not gonna hold 12 ounces so I usually go back down to right around like 80% wax so if it's 12 ounce jar I'll take it down to nine ten ounces somewhere in there and then I'll weigh that out add the oil and then I'll fill a couple different jars basically take like 12 ounce tumbler 10 ounces of wax and then I'll kind of double that up so I can kind of match it so if I'm doing three jars it'd be 30 ounces so that's like right at 2 pounds basically so I would just go ahead and add two ounces of wax fill those up kind of see where they go and see how much wax I have leftover or see how much wax I need and then I can adjust that 32 ounces up or down like one or two maybe three ounces depending on what I'm doing so if if those twelve ounce tumblers ended up only taking about nine ounces of wax I would take that back down from the 32 knock it back to around like twenty-eight twenty-nine ounces or bump it up to maybe 33 or 34 and the reason you would probably take it down a little bit more the 10 ounces I think the 12 ounce tumblers it's been a while since I've filled those I think they actually take a little bit closer to nine ounces of wax and then of course when you add the oil that's gonna bump it up a little bit more to around the 10 ounce mark but that would basically be my recommendation I usually just start out with 1 pound pour it see what it does and then if you've got extra you're gonna have a couple extra melts or just go by about 80% of the actual jar itself so again like I said a 12 ounce I would knock it down to around 9 or 10 if you're feeling like a 20 ounce jar or a bigger candle I would knock that one down probably 16 to 17 I don't know if I would go 18 on that one just because you're gonna have so much more wax that's probably gonna fill it so I would knock that one down a little bit more so probably 16 ounces in a 20 ounce container and then of course adjust as needed so I hope that made sense to a lot of people we get this question a lot and I have surprised I haven't done a video about this one in all this time it's a real easy one it's an easy one to mess up and it's one that a lot of beginners mess up every single time I did it in the beginning and somebody knew watching this video is probably still gonna do it so again if you have

elated we went to the patterning range and we were lucky enough to test these last spring and tell us about some of the results we saw well again you know if we got fifteen or sixteen in the head and neck at 40 yards we were like this is a gun I got to use this is the choke I got to use this is the combinations that's going to kill that turkey out there long range well we found out by patterning fours fives and sixes through these new guns and new choke combinations that all of a sudden our downrange at 60 yards 70 yards was effective that we've never had before and being in the video business you and I both know that you want that turkey in close but it doesn't always work like that you know there's so many birds that have slipped through our fingers at 50 60 and 70 yards that we were always afraid to take that shot not anymore not anymore and one of the things that impressed me the most was how much downrange energy and punch this ammunition had oh they're in trouble that's 40 Wow it'll easily use sixty based on that oh you see city yeah let's try sixty car no [Music] I'd say sixties year maxed which could be a choke issue the thing we have just experimenting with or a variety of chokes to see what it would do jokin Utz that's the one I don't know if we got I do have an old Mad Max with me for that gun we could throw it in there and try it once this is the original Mad Max this constriction is a 655 okay that's we were taking Birds at 40 yards on film and literally lifting them up off their feet and setting them down at 40 yards because you're putting so much shot in the air and it all retains its shape so that downrange energy is unmatched well and it's hard to be excited about some things this day and age but long beard XR was one of the most exciting revelations that we've seen in a long time it's hard to leave a meeting as pumped up as we were but we could have ran through a brick wall that day because we were absolutely jacked about long beard XR they said they had a new shot shell and we were like yeah hold on we went over there and we left with our jaws hitting the table so you can find more out about it at Winchester comm or come over to jury outdoors calm and check out some of the turkeys we killed last spring with it amazing ammunition absolutely 80 yards never I've never thought in the Maine years of trying this one so it's a bonafide 70 to 75 you wouldn't want to try eating well the rains are about to pour down upon us here but we prepare for it with smiles because we just shot the best shooting a munition we've ever shot in our lives those are done Thor's at 60 yards number fours I think the choke size constriction has got everything to do with it so you can't just put it in your gun and say I'm gonna gain 40 yards 30 yards you got a really pattern it and find out which shot selection you might want to use we tried a 655 a 660 and a 665 restriction and everyone varied and we shot them all so make sure you spend some time on the range with this new ammunition it'll pay dividends but it did definitively gain 15 to 25 yards that we didn't have before so look at that pattern we know a few birds are gonna be in trouble this spring [Music]", "Et1isD6fqwo": "right lesson 1-8 optimizations with linear programming graph is system of inequality of inequalities named the coordinates of the vertices of the feasible region and then you find the maximum and the minimum values of the given function this is the function that we need to graph okay let's grab this one first y greater or equal to 1 and Y smaller or equal to 4 we have one of this line right here and 4 is right here let me draw this line alright now when you drop inequality you need to shade it so I'm gonna I will give you the financial later once I'm done with all of this graphing so what is when keep in mind the the region of solution is in between this line so in in between these two lines now that's kind of you to grab this line right here now to grab this line let's try to simplify this one first so we have for y greater than or equal to 6x minus 32 let's simplify this by 4 and y greater than or equal to 6 divided by 4 left 6 before or we have 3 over 2x and then my necessary to divide by 4 you have 832 divided 4 is at 8 now after that let's do the graphing now when you grab this line let me transform it into simpler term first while greater than or equal to 3 over 2x minus 8 all right this line let's get a table value for this one Alex and why table value not when X 0 Y is negative way but I didn't want to use all the wasted negative H you know a bit I didn't draw the graph here for that small number negative value so I'll let me try to find something else that make X if X equal to 2 3 now you look fine now let make X equal to 4 ok so when my egg is 4 4 times 2 I'm sorry 4 times 3 12 12 divided by 2 there's 6 6 minus 8 you got minus 2 so if my X is 8 you have to actually let me do the division first 8 divided by 2 year for format 5 by 3 you got 12 12 minus 8 you get 4 so now you have 2 points to graph the line so 0 or throw wine for X negative 2 so Y where Y for X for y negative 2 so we have X 4 y 92 somewhere here that's one point and then when the egg is eight your Y is 4 somewhere here so when you have that let's roll the line okay now where did you grab what did you do the shading okay so look at this IRA here why greater than so when it is greater than you shed above the line greater than above the line so this is the region of solution we shed above the line okay now let's go to our last line let me try to convert this into simpler terms first we have y greater than or equal to you divide this one by two you have a negative one over two x and you also have a plus two so you have this line you need to graph y then or equal to negative one over two x and then plus two a fine table values of this equation okay x and y now I get a 0 0 Y is 2 now when you act this to say f is 2 2 times 1/2 negative 2 divided by 2 D of 1 negative 1 plus 2 you get 1 0 Y 2 when your egg is to your Y is one okay when you have that last graph what should be on the the point why it's not like that - Oh make mistake on that that's why should be here - 2 1 now make it the wrong point is negative 1 no 2 1 here that's why they're wise something wrong with this okay okay now the region sharing region this is greater than or equal to looking at the original equation this is greater than or equal to so you said above the line now it seems like right now we have a common shedding region to me where this one and give you a proper shading of the answer so you have another point here as a vertices so this is the shading region laughter I'm on this one now we have four vertices actually yep one two three and four this all the intersection of the solution vision after that let's answer the question named recall the night of each vertices okay that's well you can represent letter or you don't want to represent letter that's up to you I'll just name it right away that's it problem from here I'll just put ABC easier it'll be C and B okay now at Point a what do we have here since this you have starting from here you have negative 4 and then you have 1 2 3 4 90 4 and 4 and then for point B 1 B you have this one 8 and then 1 2 3 4 8 and 4 for Point C Point C you have this one as 6 and then 1 and the last one for body the last vertex vertex is D which is 2 & 1 ok now after that need to find the maximum and the minimum values of the given function not to do so you need to start to this each of these vertices into this equation down here let's start with a first doubleday so job is one ounce negative six and your time oxygen negative four and then you plus three times y which is four let me do this one so yeah negative six times negative negative six times negative four 24 24 and then you plus with 12 that give you 36 that's perform nearly 36 after that let's go on to point B point B up negative six x is 1 8 then last with three times for the up negative 6 times 8 and and you plus 12 they give you negative 36 so that poem see negative 6 times 6 and then G Plus with 3 times 4 so 6 times 6 is negative 6 negative 36 over negative 36 your minus 12 give energy plus whether or not - you plus further to give you negative 24 and then the last point which is last for this which is it is 6 and you times by average is 2 and then 3 plus 3 I'm sorry this is not this times 1 mistake so you have stirred negative 36 + 1 negative 33 first one select last week this one here negative 12 plus 3 equal to negative so among this four vertices we can stress find the maximum and minimum value of this inequality system of inequality so from here so therefore this is the maximum there is the biggest number 36 and the negative number is the minimum number so the maximum and right this one for you maximum value", "jTpEXmoH4eM": "hi seventh grade welcome to your second day of review for the New York State math test let's start with number 19 Jensen stopped at a rest area a along the side of a highway his map shown below has a scale of 1 inch to 35 miles Jensen planned to stop at rest area being next what is the actual distance in miles between the two rest areas well if one inch is equal to 35 miles and we know rest area B is 2.5 inches away we can set up a proportion and cross multiply 1 X is equal to 35 x 2.5 get out my calculator and x equals 87 point 5 miles which statement describes the decimal equivalent of 7 over 8 remember decimal looks jessica division symbol so if we do 7 divided by 8 we get 0.875 so it's a decimal with a repeating digit of 5 no it does not repeat it's a dead small with repeating digits of 75 again doesn't rest repeat it's a decimal that terminates after two decimal places well 1 - nope it's a decimal that terminates after 3 decimal places oops and the way across that out because that is the answer number 21 which expression is equivalent the expression shown below so I need to do some things here we can first PEMDAS so inside the parenthesis can we do anything and we can we can take this and add it so I'm going to turn everything into well let's leave it as fractions because fractions are what's in the answer so I've got negative 1/2 negative 3 Alex I want to add it to the 6x so I'm going to make 6x 12 over 2 is 12 over 2 is equal to 6 plus 1 minus 3x you can combine like terms negative 3 halves X + 12 halves X so I'm gonna leave my 1 1/2 negative 1/2 and negative 3 halves plus 12 half is 9 halves X plus 1 minus 3x and then you gotta distribute negative 1/2 times 9 halves is gonna be negative 9 over 4 X plus negative 1/2 minus 3x so I can combine like terms I got negative 9/4 and negative 3 with axes so I'm gonna turn that 3 put it over 1 2/4 so that's gonna be times 4 times 4 so I have negative 9/4 X minus 12 fourths X minus 1/2 so I know it's gonna be minus 1/2 so I'm gonna cross out see right away otherwise have minus 1/2 negative 9 minus 12 is going to give us negative 21 over 4 X minus 1/2 4 goes into 21 seven times no five times so that's gonna be negative five and 1/4 X minus 1/2 oh there it is d all right Leanne clocks data throughout basketball season and uses these data to determine the probabilities of different teams playing in the league championship game probabilities over four favorite teams playing the championship game are shown below which of these teams least likely to play in the championship game so we want to find the one with the lowest probability well two thirds is equal to about sixty six point six repeating per side four fifths is eighty percent three eighths let's see 3 divided by 8 is 37 0.5% and one half is 50 percent so least likely to play would be the Bulldogs if the lowest percentage of winning next one number 25 the initial balance of savings account was 275 after which transactions with a balance of the savings account the same as the initial balance so we want which everyone would cancel out so withdrawal meaning take away two hundred and thirty-two dollars followed by a deposit which is adding 132 those don't cancel a deposit so we're adding 278 followed by a withdrawal so subtracting 270 those cancel each other out let's try the others withdrawal of 115 followed by a deposit of 312 that wouldn't cancel out and a positive 205 so adding 205 and then withdrawing 317 so that one doesn't cancel out either number 26 a researcher surveyed five randomly selected employees from each of four different companies about their daily commutes to work the table shows the commute times for the surveyed employees based on the data which company is most likely which company most likely has the longest average commute time per employee so we have to find the average for each company so remember the average is when you add them all up and divide by how many there are so the first company 24 plus 26 plus 28 plus 23 plus 21 and divide that by five 24.4 and then the next one six plus 32 plus nine plus 31 plus 21 divided by 5 is 19 point 8 and the third company 15 plus 15 plus 15 oh they're all 15 divided by 5 is 15 and the last one 13 plus 10 plus 45 plus 12 plus 15 divided by 5 is 19 so which company most likely has the longest average commute that would be the company 1 they have an average of twenty four point four minutes 27 in this kale drawing of apartment one centimetre represents 2 and 3/4 feet the length of the kitchen is 4 and 1/2 centimeters on the scale drawing what is the actual length in feet of the kitchen so again we're gonna set up our proportion one centimeter is 2.75 feet and the actual drawing is 4.5 centimeters and we want to know how many feet that is so cross multiply 1 X is equal to and we do just to 0.75 times 4.5 to get twelve point three seven five so that's D can always double check it's the only one that has 12 is the whole number a passenger train has tickets available for twelve window seats and eight aisle seats the next person of our ticket will be randomly assigned to one of those seats what is the probability that the next person will be assigned in aisle seat well there are eight possible aisle seats out of a total of twenty seats available because you add these two together 12 plus 8 that reduces - if we divide both by four that reduces to two-fifths answer is be 32 the scale drawing of a field in the shape of a triangle as shown below what is the actual area in square meters of this field so we are going to find out area of a triangle is one-half base times height so one-half the base is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 that is 1 2 3 4 5 so 1/2 7 times 5 is 35 so if I know what half of 35 is it's 17.5 but you have to pay attention use the key each box is worth 2 meters so you're gonna have to go and convert that by multiplying by 2 in the answer is C because 17.5 times 2 is 35 a vehicle uses 1 in an eighth ounce of gasoline to travel 13 and a half miles at this rate how many miles can the vehicle travel per gallon of gasoline so if we've got 13.5 miles in 1 point C 1 in 1/8 1/8 1.125 gallons I want to see how far can it go with 1 gallon of gas so I set up my proportion cross multiply 13.5 is equal to one point one two five X divide both sides by 1 point 1 2 5 cancels out on the right 13 divided by 1.1 five is equal to eleven point five repeating which is about twelve miles all right that's oh yeah for today seventh-grade um I hope you're enjoying your break and we will continue this tomorrow bye", "OTBFMWt-VJg": "hi welcome to another Thames read-throughs today we'll be jumping back into a feast of Ice and Fire making a recipe from Winterfell turnips and butter the Lord seated at the head of the table had been left empty but Rob's at to the right of it with brand across remember they eat suckling pig that night and pigeon pie and turnip soaking in butter and afterward the cook and promised honeycombs a game of Thrones so we'll be making medieval armored turnips says here turnips have sadly been pushed aside over time by their more modern cousin the potato however this medieval recipe is rich and flavorful and the turnips act as a delightful canvas for cheap for the cheese and spices a historically accurate version of potatoes au gratin the garnish turnips are lovely on any medieval table so it takes about five or six turnips we're gonna use about 6 ounces of Parmesan cheese and 4 ounces of Parma six ounces of mozzarella cheese 4 ounces of parmesan and we're just say you're 4 tablespoons of butter and then there's also a spice that we'll be using called could reduce pou D re do you see now I may be pronouncing that wrong I'm not entirely sure but that's what we're gonna start off with so let me pause it here get set up and we'll put together some food reduce okay food reduce or sweet powder was the common medieval spice mix equally useful for flavouring savory main courses and sweet desserts it was also used to season mulled wine or hippocras we've replaced the cassia flour with extra cinnamon although if ground cassia is available two teaspoons may be used in place of half of the regular cinnamon then it has a recipe here from a medieval cookbook take four ounces of very fine cinnamon 2 ounces of fine Casilla flour an ounce of selected mecca ginger an ounce of grains of paradise and 1/6 of an ounce of nutmeg and gallon gow gallon gael combined crush them all together take a good half ounce of this powder and eight ounces of sugar which thus makes sweet powder lad the Ender day tell events 14th century like I said we have four and a half teaspoons of cinnamon 1 teaspoon of ground ginger 1 teaspoon of grains of paradise pinch of nutmeg a pinch of Galan Gale I'm really not sure the pronunciation of that one and one cup of sugar and it says to combine all the ingredients and store in a small airtight jar so I'll be doing that in just a second here we have the food reduce it's the cup of sugar it's on the bottom there's four and a half teaspoons of cinnamon the teaspoon of ginger a teaspoon of grains of paradise which is this right here and then there's a pension nutmeg and a pinch of the garlic also I'll be mixing this up and we'll be putting this in layers of the of the turnips okay the next step is peeling and boiling the turnips it says to peel them and boil them until they're soft so yeah I got a few started already and let's see you see what I can do this all fancy-like for you nope close it was close but yeah so we'll be peeling these and for those of you who haven't really cooked with turnips before my first time is actually the last recipe which was the sister stew yeah that actually turned out really good it's something I plan on making a lot especially on rainy days and you know in the wintertime it's just it's just one of those recipes that really warms you to the bone but yeah they're kind of you kind of have a smell of a radish which I'm not really fond of radish I never was I don't like him at my salad I like the flavor but they're not as pungent I think it's kind of like a bland radish almost like the book says you know they're kind of 1:1 to the potato which really has me looking forward to this recipe here so once I get this one peel they got about one more and then we'll we'll get them in a pot of boiling water and get them boiling once once that gets rolling then I'll probably pick up the video again and we'll continue with some of the rest of the parts of the recipe okay so the next steps are well I peeled the turnips and have them boiling till tender about 20 minutes it says it's just then allow them to cool and in the meantime grate or slice the mozzarella or provolone cheese or great B or n great parmesan so I skipped a step because probably shouldn't never but I just went ahead and got some shredded cheese now I guess for cooking probably should've got some nice mozzarella cheese since I'm doing this on the video I'm sorry about that I feel like I'm short changed you tell you what on the next video no not the next one because I don't know what I'm doing next but when I do the bowl of brown video I'm gonna go all-out for them so shortchanged on this one i'ma hook you up on the next one so I got free track pre-shredded cheese the next step will be coating the bottom of the nine by nine pan and then oh no no before we coat the bottom of the pan we will be slicing the cool turn-up so I [Music] just started them waters not even boiling yet once that's boiling I'll go over and check on those and from there I'll get them out let them cool probably hang out and yeah just kick it for a minute and we'll slice them up real thin and we'll get this thing rolling okay we've got some got some boiled and cooled turnips oh I almost called him potatoes so the recipe calls for slicing these as thin as possible now you want a sharp knife for this and I tell you the slice really easy it also is going to make the cooking time less in the oven now I've got the oven preheating so after I get these sliced I plan on actually thicker than I wanted it after I get these sliced I'm going to be putting these in the pan and getting them ready for I have to apologize for the background my fiance has found Riverdale on Netflix and I have no idea what that shows about this one seems a bit thick I'm gonna put that maybe we'll put that on the bottom so we'll be cutting the rest of these and then putting them in the pan so yeah I guess I could we'll come back when we're getting the pan together now the last part before baking is go at the bottom of a deep nine by nine inch pan or nine inch round baking dish with butter then arrange the ingredients and layers that are thin as possible first some cheese then some turnips and some butter then some spice repeat the layers until ingredients are used up keeping each layer as thin as possible top with more cheese bake until the cheese is just melted around 15 minutes so let me start off here with a little bit of butter [Music] so and here comes Messi probably wanting some cheese do a thin layer okay now now some turnips yes some of these terms that I got are a little bit smaller than the others all right have some butter I might have been a bit much and now some spice remember the spice is the food reduce this is what I didn't have this is what I couldn't fit in the shaker so I'm trying to use this up before I move on to what I have in the shaker there so now we're going in for mozzarella [Music] now if I were doing this sliced mozzarella or like I should have got a good actual ball of mozzarella these would be slight thin slices going on top it's on top of each turnip yes and like I said it's Riverdale in the background which I don't know too much about it's supposed to be an Archie story thin layer anyway when you pick that back up Oh peanut butter for the last layer and the good reduce is um it's probably pooed the reduce or something along those lines but it is the grains of paradise the cinnamon there's a cup of sugar in there it's mostly sugar insert a cup of sugar 4 TSP for the 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon a teaspoon of ginger a teaspoon of the grains of paradise and a pinch of nutmeg and a pinch of gulling gah Gowen gals on Ballinger is it some of these spices I'm not familiar with but I'm really looking forward to using especially that greens of paradise it's it's got kind of a citrusy smell to it but the label says something along the lines of the peppery taste and excited about that mozzarella parmesan and moving on to I think the last two turnips here kind of wish I have a bigger bigger pan so this might be the final layer that's actually really thick yeah that actually I think is the final layer just because I'm gonna have to top it all and now this will be served with more butter since they order butter turnips and you know I was thinking about that maybe maybe I'll have to when I make meals out of these like I should have last week with the roasted or not last week but the last time with the roasted arts with leeks I should be actually I should be actually showing these plated but there's always time for that in the future I know for a fact I'll be making the sisters stew again it's a bit much on them so the sisters - maybe I'll be able to make and plate up maybe I'll even make the black bird to go with it so with that I'll be putting another layer of cheese and then popping this into the oven for about 15 minutes until the cheese is melted and popping it out to show you the finished product so you better cheese here we've been on the video there that was part of them don't spot the end the video just trying to ease up the rest of what I have in the bowl because I've got this here that I made and I've got four other containers with it so yeah with that we will put this in the bowl or put this in the oven and cook it for about 15 minutes okay it's been about 15 minutes now timer just went off so let's open this up in check it out smells amazing cinnamon you can really smell it I can see this buttery cut off the oven there and she's just probably too much cinnamon 1 now see some melted cheese whoa and here comes a blind puppy look at that cheese the butter just dripping off so yeah there we go we've got some buttered turnips from feast of Ice and Fire so yeah got a forking outside that songs on screen for you mean chilled action here pretty good pretty good look at that I'd give it two thumbs up but I'm hold the plate so with that we end another Tim's readers today the feast of Ice and Fire edition and I hope you enjoyed it I hope you enjoy the recipe when you get around to making it and thanks for watching like comment subscribe and hit that little notification bell I'll see

summertime favorite and that's hot dogs again much like the summer sausage there are some advanced techniques here but we're going to give you the knowledge along with the tools that we have here from meet your maker you're going to turn out a delicious tasty hot dog now in this case we're using venison along with pork fat we know fat is flavor and we're going to tell you and teach you how to marry these two together so you get that nice juicy bite hot dog with hot dogs one of the things that really makes them so special and really even makes them a hot dog is that they're very finely ground or the meat particles are reduced to really you can't even feel them when you bite into them very hard to do without the use of a bowl chopper ie bolt cutter where you actually emulsify the meat however by using the grinder a technique that includes using ice we're going to grind these through until we get a nice smooth texture then we're going to put them in our mixer we're going to mix them to get that protein extraction and then we're going to stuff them um we're going to be using a cellulose casing this is a 28 millimeter cellulose casing basically just means it's plastic that casing will be peeled off at the end after this product is cooked so stick with us as we tell you everything you need to know about how to process and turn out a tasty traditional hot dog using wild game i know you guys have some meat in your freezer from last season this is a great thing to make especially if you have little kids everybody knows little kids are super picky eaters and a hot dog is usually one thing that most kids will eat so if you're looking for something to make the whole family can enjoy follow along and make some hot dogs i'm going to point something out else out here too so what we've done is we've taken and we've kind of made a habit out of um thinking for the future and we want you to do this too we've taken and we've separated our lean trimmings and we've already vacuum sealed them using our meat vacuum sealer we have the chamber back we've we've sealed these up and we've put them in convenient bags now we've got two and a half pounds pork fat written on the back of these so we have these nice lean cubes still partially frozen that's really how we want to begin our processing process cubed up nice and you know uniform and something that we've been asked about in some of our recent videos and we want to address is if you have deer or or gay meat that's already been ground up it's already been processed to the point where um that that initial step has been completed where it's ground you can use that product um to go ahead and and and do this process it's the the really the tough part about that is you don't know exactly where your fat content is in this case you know this is very lean almost zero less than five percent and we know we're just going to add the five pounds or 20 percent of pork fat to it so that's that's the one variable you don't know when you already have it ground up if it has pork fat no fat whatever obviously you can look at it but you certainly can start with product that was previously ground and frozen to get to this point right here but in this case we've we always prepare for the future not knowing you know maybe we make a batch of hot dogs when we initially process but we don't know how quickly we'll go through the hot dog so we hold some of this product over in the freezer with the intention of down the road further processing it and that really makes it convenient on processing day too because you know rather than put the pressure on yourself to get everything processed right at the time of harvest you can preserve for the future in the uh in the vacuum sealed bags you can go into the freezer the stuff's going to remain perfect just like the day that you harvested it and it certainly is safe and acceptable to freeze it defrost it rework it and freeze it a second time certainly no concern there now that i've got my meat all blended up in this tub i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to add my seasonings once again what we like to do is point out that you can take any shaker of our bearded butcher blend seasoning and the ratio that you mix it to is 6 ounces to 12 pounds of meat so in this case having 25 pounds of meat i can go ahead and take this and dump it right into my lug the form of two six ounce shakers dump it right into my mixture in fact i'll mix that around a little bit start to fold that in we like to mix our spices into our trimmings and then grind we get a really nice blend that way so two shakers for 12 total ounces in this case we're using original beer to butcher blend seasoning these are hot dogs that we make for our store here and they're delicious and we can't get enough of them now one of the things to point out about the cellulose casing it's non-permeable it won't accept any flavor from the oven smoker cooker whatever you're doing you certainly can use a collagen casing even a sheep casing good luck with those if you decided to use those but we want to get all the flavor into the product because when we cook it it's not going to accept any flavor we're just cooking it because of the cellulose casing in addition to our 12 ounces of beer to butcher blend original we have got four mount four ounces of fresh minced garlic we love garlic in our hot dogs and we've got four ounces of our natural hickory smoked powder that's what really gives us our nice flavor yet still on the counter we have the one ounce of sure cure we're not going to add that in until our final mixing so as the smell starts to hit me my mouth starts to water and i start to think about how delicious this product is going to be now that we've thoroughly hand mixed it's time to go ahead and start dropping this through our number 32 meat grinder all right quickly before i um start grinding while this is nice and clean i just want to go over real quick um how easy this thing is to assemble disassemble i know we've talked about the different components a little bit with changing knives but i just wanted to point out just because one of the things about the the meat equipment is super easy to clean and super friendly i do want to point out this bushing right here you see how we have this all nicely oiled this bushing right here make sure that when you assemble and reassemble that you have this bushing this plastic bushing goes inside your worm here then of course you've got your extra storage on this plate we didn't talk about much but this would come into play it's called a kidney plate because it looks like a kidney and traditionally in the in the commercial meat industry we use these uh grind out like things like pork fat so we can make lard maybe we'll get into that someday but you get the kidney plate it's really nice to keep everything but yeah this goes back in very easily it's just got a nice it's all hand all hand tightened so yeah bushing goes inside your grinder head and that worm's just gonna go in there and you might have to you might have to turn it just a little bit to line up the shaft looks like i'm lined up really nice of course your plate and of course we're starting with the course head for our first grind that's going to line up right here on the bottom it's recessed once you get to that point you're just going to thread this on like i said all by hand no tools required that sets on there we're ready to start grinding all right friend friendly reminder we like to start with a little bit in there these these grinders they don't like to sit there and run dry so once we have that started then i can just reach around flip it on and away she goes and by a way she goes i mean i gotta stick with it or else i i even set my plunger aside because like i've mentioned with this stuff um being as cold as it is and then in um what we would call sort of golf ball size pieces is just gonna chew right this number 32 grinder is going to chew right through here especially with uh with the 10 millimeter of the 32 or excuse me the 10 millimeter 3 8 inch plate you can see it this is where the plunger would actually go if i need to but i'm just as quickly as i can get two handfuls set up here and dropped in it takes it which is really nice because if you've ever worked with a grinder that doesn't have this capability it can get frustrating in a hurry seth wanted to just stand and watch but i said hey i need another set of hands here because like i said literally as fast as i can feed it this grinder eats i think i can handle this portion only problem is he's going to start micromanaging now older brothers i tell ya i was just gonna mention how nice the the fat consistency was in that meat and that's gonna blend in even more and more as we go there we have it grind uh grind number one complete through the 3 8 inch plate now we're going to change plates go for grind number two through our 4.5 millimeter or 1 8 inch plate okay grind number two hit me up [Music] this is where you're gonna employ like i mentioned before a little bit of that cat fall method where you want to kind of just get it get it moved into that if you're at all worried about my fingers i mean this guard is here for a purpose if you look i mean my fingers are still at least four or five inches away from the and obviously if i'm gonna push it any further i'm gonna use uh i'm gonna use the plunger just because never ever wanna remove guards from your pieces of equipment they're there for your safety all right so grind number three you know as this blade is in here cutting against this uh grinder plate it's reducing our our meat and fat particles again and again and that's what a bowl chop or a bowl cutter will do it will continue to reduce the particles and really what those have is they have a blade that spins at a terrific rpm like it depends on the model but up to 6000 rpms per minute or revolutions per minute but in this case we're replicating that process by using the grinder the grinder knife um and really that's just to get that real fine texture to our hot dog as you can see it's being reduced and the in the mixture is becoming more and more uniform now this being grind three we're going to use a trick and we're gonna because a lot of these recipes will tell you that you want to grind once through the 3 8 and twice through the 1 8 but we're going to go for at least one more grind after this and we're going to use a trick to get it through there if it if it needs a little help because as you work this meat down it a couple things will happen um one that you'll get friction obviously with all the the grinding and the meat will warm up and you just simply can't have that it's still cold now so the trick we'll use will take care of that and the other one would be that it just doesn't want to find its way um through that plate so we've got a trick on the next grind that's going to help you get that fine consistency that we're looking for all right this is doing so well that we're not gonna use our secret trick which is ice until um until we get to we're gonna go for uh grind number five so that was the end of grind number three want to beam me up no go ahead you're gonna find you're gonna find yourself at this point you're gonna be doing all sorts of uh you know you might even find yourself singing a little work tune like here we go a grinding for the fourth time because this is when things only stick to butchering not singing things slow down you can do the the drop you can make little bomb sounds like but you're you're definitely going to uh get slower and slower in fact we might be slower on the fourth grind than the fifth grind just because we haven't brought the ice in yet you can see the consistency of the product now we're getting real starting to get protein extraction really reducing those particles you do not want your hot dog to look like a sausage um in the sense where you have that real you really don't want the definition of the the particles to be seen in the hot dog all right that's it for grind number four now and this is where i'm going to change my gloves even just to shut this thing off because your protein extraction starts get going and anything you touch the stuff sticks to time uh it's a good time to point out that you don't have to use a binder like um a lot of times you you'll find a commercial operation so use like a non-fat dry milk powder to get the stuff to bind together but in this case because the way that we're grinding we're getting proteins that are binding together so now in fact i'll just show you right here what we're going to do is we're going to take we're going to just we're going to literally just dump in two and a half pounds which is 10 of you know just your store-bought ice or whatever and we'll mix that in handmax that in and when we grind it in it's actually going to help us this stuff's still nice and it's cool it's not quite as cold as when we first started still nice and cool but that's going to do two things it's going to bring the temperature back down if the friction's got it warmed up and then it's also going to help punch this through here for the last and final fifth grind so let's mix it up and get started look at you johnny on the spot with my gloves you mean you've had gloves this whole time and haven't told me duh we're in the rockies yeah so we can just fold those ice cubes in and then the grinder will grab it pull them through as we go big big thing is is just to have faith at this point because things are going to slow down that you want to just stick with it it's well worth it to get that product in the end because like we mentioned traditional style ballpark juicy soft kids will eat them people will say those can't be deer and you'll be like yeah you made them yourself yeah this is the point where you have to put in that you know a little extra effort just stick with it and we shouldn't on this final grind having this meat equipment is a huge benefit to this process because without this type of equipment does not happen without nope all right round in uh third well-rounding third we're at home plate pretty much this is grind five as you can see we really don't have any uh particle definition or not much at all just know from experience we would not get this through another time and frankly why would we want to try commercial product is going to get to uh almost toothpaste consistency it really will look like cake batter so this puppy right here amazing that went fantastic it it's not it's not hot it's not tripping any fuses it's not doing anything like that we ran it um for the better part of uh 40 minutes or so cycling through these grinds obviously they slow down as you go along so now what we're going to do is we're going to put it in the mixer and we're going to mix for eight minutes that's the point we're gonna add our cure we're gonna add a little bit more water that's going to pretty much finalize our protein extraction and then we're going to the stuffer i'm going to show you a convenient way for you to link these hot dogs you just have to stick with it and you'll see that in a minute but mixer next let's get going meat matrimony that's what we have we married our mixer to our grinder it was super simple we just took the mixing head off put it in a lug put the mixer on now we're going to load up our 25 pounds hot dog mix like mentioned we're starting to get some protein extraction but we're going to work it a little bit more and that's why we have to have the mixer we're going to be adding our cure in this step and working it for about eight minutes and we want to reverse every minute we want to reverse the direction that we're mixing one ounce of pink cure going into our mixture with what with wild game we always used to look we like to use sodium nitrate versus the celery juice powder just because you know you have a little bit higher risk of bacteria with wild game versus commercial there we go i'm just putting one bottle of water because we have the ice in there i'll take a look at it and after we mix it maybe halfway and see if we need any more water so one minute one direction one minute in the opposite direction we'll do that about eight minutes four times each way so got the next generation great part about this is scott has his son brady and i've got my son luke oldest boys and we're teaching them how to do this as well so next generation that's one of the great things about working with this stuff is the family fellowship that you get while you're working with it i did decide to add my second bottle of water just because the texture was getting pretty firm so that just just means that it absorbed the more lean meat that you have in it the more water it can actually absorb um and with venison it can it can take quite a bit that's how commercial processors really uh they use like lean bowl meat and that's how they can get it to really take in a bunch of water so with uh wild game you can typically get uh you know quite a bit of water in there you don't want to overdo it but in this case it definitely needed it all right we're done all right all right all right that's going to be the word for this video all right so i can just pull this out this stuff it's got that nice tackiness and we unplug this son of a gun because last thing you want is to have your hand up in here messing around and have the unit power on safety first get this dug out see how we got that protein extraction get it loaded into our 15 pound mixer stuffer and then comes the fun part stuffer stuffer 15 pound stuffer see i do serve a purpose here now is when things get real quiet because the power tools are no longer in play obviously a 15 pound stuffer stuffer we can fit um you know a little over 50 into this so we'll fill it up in the first round try to get that air pushed out of there as best we can manually and then seth will show you how it works on that end of the now what we do is we put the stuffer inside here we start cranking down and as mentioned in the summer sausage video there's an air release right here so as this pops up you can see it pop up you push down with your finger and it'll you can actually hear it it'll release that air so you can see the products coming through this horn it's nice that these horns are clear that way you can see where it starts and then we're starting to come out of the extrude out the end so you want to hold your thumb and your forefinger up against that casing making sure that you don't allow any air into it as you stuff watch your casing real close down here towards the end you don't want to squirt too much product out of the stuffing horn and not have enough casing so when it gets down here to the end you'll just reverse crank your stuff for a little bit and it'll stop did i hear you say you're going to invite me over tomorrow night for a hot dog gross you heard right you said something about uh when i said shooting challenge i said there's nothing better than uh hot dogs over campfire i meant it so i want you to come over tomorrow night and i want to challenge you to a shoot off an archery shoot-off so you're going to hold your bottle of seasoning on your head and i'm going to shoot it at it now you're going to go first just so you know and then i will hold my bottle of seasoning on top of my head and you can shoot at it we're going to be planning a funeral for you about probably you no i'll challenge you to a shoot off you want to do it yeah all right you heard it weenie roast and uh archery shoot off i'll have my bow tech in hand there you have it now what you want to do at this point is you want to just it makes a nice comfy bed no i'm joking so obviously we've got um a bunch of really long hot dogs here and you can you can um there there's going to be talk about twisting people say you can twist this way and then you can twist that way and and quite frankly those untwist and they become uh again one big long hot dog so we're gonna show you the european method of tying seth and i do it a little bit differently um i do it the correct way he does it the incorrect way no anyway i sense another challenge there's no wrong way but i start by twisting my first heart hot dog and then in this case i i portion out like another size and i twist like this and then i come up and i go through and roll and then i'm i'm left with a bunch of three hot dogs like that he's going to tell me he loops and swoops and goes through and i think his is actually the correct way but what we've got then these are going to be um and obviously depending on what length you tie at but eight hot dogs make up a pound because we're using the 28 millimeter cellulose casing um if you want a smaller hot dog you can obviously use a smaller millimeter casing these are available on amazon and other butcher supply stores we buy obviously big bags of them you don't have to do that you can get like what do we do less than two strands here make up uh about only about one one strand one in uh one and a quarter to get these 25 pounds through and these are appealable casings so once we remove them um and and we better uh illustrate and slow down for one of these because somebody's going to be pausing this like heck ready here's how here's how i do what he does i take my thumb and forefinger with my right hand and i pinch and then i pull this loop through just like this get it to the length of hot dogs that you would like and you pinch twist turn these two and then repeat that process again so you just keep doing that you twist pull the next strand up pinch pull it through twist pinch pull through and so on and so forth and as you get speedy at it you can just like that so now you can see those are all tied up ready to go 25 pounds venison hot dogs at this point we're going to hold them in the cooler overnight obviously for you that would be a fridge or some place where you want to keep them cold the reason being they have sodium nitrate in it they do not have a cure accelerator we want to let them sit overnight let all those flavors mesh together let that cure work these are going to get this beautiful um red color when we cook them and so to cook them we're going to do the traeger 885 basically a smoker now should be mentioned these are non-permeable casing means no flavor from the smoker is actually going to go into this casing we're not going to get any smoke flavor from the traeger however it's going to be a great way to cook another thing with hot dogs is they'll mention a lot of times you watch some of the recipes about humidity control traeger is great at that whenever you cook foods in it they um they retain a lot of the moisture and again these are plastic so no if you were using collagen you have to worry about humidity but there's no humidity loss so we're going to hold them overnight put them in the traeger cook them ice bath peel them put them over the campfire see you then sounds like a good time to me let's do it [Music] [Music] it's time to get these hot dogs on the tracker these sat in the cooler overnight they're starting to get some nice color when we put them on this traeger they're gonna get a beautiful red color going man what a day this is beautiful out here sun shining scott and i got up this morning we got a five mile run in wow felt great so i'm just going to start laying these on the rack and we want to make sure that the best that put them on here the best that we can so that they don't touch because if the hot dogs touch they'll uh they'll cook unevenly there so we want to definitely want to try to spread them out get a nice little space between them and just go back and forth top and bottom see how we do we may have to split one of these just to be able to get them to all fit so this is 25 pounds and i think it's going to fill up this ironwood 885 pretty well we can come back out and turn them after a couple hours or so we're gonna do um two hours at 165 two hours at 185 and then go ahead and crank to 205 if we need to just to finish them off so now they're all on there let's go back through and make sure they have just a little bit of spacing get that heat up between those hot dogs i think that looks pretty good don't forget your meat probe kind of probe them so with the meat probe you always want to go in the thickest portion because that's what's going to cook the least amount and typically when you tie these like this it's going to be right here in this in this end so probably what i'm going to do is start here then i'm just going to run that probe up right into the end of that hot dog just like that we're going to let these go and we may come out part way through rotate them in just a little bit so that smoke gets around the hot dogs real nice and then we will um keep an eye on our tent see you soon it's time to check on the hot dogs we ran these at two hours 165 degrees we ran them for an hour at 185 and then we ran them for an additional hour at 205 totaling four hours on the traeger 885 so let's crack the lid let's take a peek there you have it i see some very nice color throughout doesn't look like there's any part of the hot dog that's not cooked so at this point what we're going to do is remove our probe i see you finally decided to get out of your chair last time so now now he wants to be with this the ice bath for the hot dogs but instead it's going to be an ice bucket challenge now he wants to be a part of the process so now what we're going to do is we're simply going to take the hot dogs since they've met internal temp of 165 and we're just going to dunk them in an ice bath this is gonna help stop the cooking process and it's gonna they're gonna cool very very rapidly so we're just gonna go right into our ice bath got the bottom rack done time for the top rack so there you have the hot dogs in the ice bath we're gonna let them sit here until they get nice and chilled and then we're gonna peel the casings and get some in some vacuum bags using the meat vacuum sealer the chamber vac and we're gonna let them sit the rest of the afternoon in the cooler and tonight we're gonna have a campfire so stick along come along we're gonna have a good time practice this do this one no i'm not holding an apple on my head hot dog beautiful stack of venison hot dogs here hot diggity dog wanted to demonstrate real quick to peel all you need to do is make a very slight incision right here and then this casing will just uh peel right off so that's what we've we've already peeled all these hot dogs so we wanted to show you the finished product wanted to talk to if you get any what we call fat out where a little bit of your fat may leach out into the case you see a little bit of my thumb right there that's perfectly normal perfectly fine you can wipe these puppies off or you can even use a little bit of lukewarm water to to rinse them off but shall we absolutely let's take a look at the cross section and see what we've got you want to do like we did with the summer sausage and cut it and then reveal it yep let's do that so here it goes there's the cut there's the hot dog so there we go we've reduced those fat particles to uh you know a very fine amount there and that's that's the goal with hot dogs so that's going to give us a nice soft bite there's another one there um i think the only thing left to do is give these puppies a taste test we cold hot oaks for breakfast all the time so oh my nice texture wonderful flavor that hickory smoked powder that we put in there those are amazing delicious um obviously we use the two shakers of the beard butcher blend seasoning for the 25 pound batch of hot dogs i want to remind you you can of course get the bucket which is a total of 12 shakers if you're gonna do a lot of these that's something that you're certainly going to want to do now that we've got our hot dogs and our vacuum pack only thing left to do is take these over here seal them up with our meat chamber back here comes my favorite part there you have it venison hot dogs now you can pop these in your freezer in this case they're not gonna make to the freezer we are taking these bad boys down to my house for a good old-fashioned hot dogs over the campfire i can't wait so just remember that when you do vacuum seal these these would be good in your refrigerator for up to about 30 days other than that just toss them in your freezer when you want to pack pull them out thaw them and they're ready to go but like scott said next time we're going to try these is going to be on a hot dog stick around a campfire good times coming stay tuned let's head to scott's house let's get some cooking over the campfire [Music] do [Music] welcome to my humble abode i gotta get my bow put a uh schooling on stuff there's my dog where's my big green egg there's my cracker that's where my bows hanging see if he's ready to go out here getting ready to get his butt whooped you ready it's about time you show up to the park both shooting identical bows bow tech revolt x's so we can't blame it on equipment it's going to be on the shooter it's very windy out here gold tip arrows it is pretty windy so whether you want to account for that these bows do shoot pretty fast so um so 30 yards there's uh a beer to butcher hot blend with my likeness on it and a beard butcher cajun blend with his likeness on it i'm gonna be shooting at my blend he's gonna be shooting at his blend see who can put one least amount of arrows to put one right through your through your bottle let me show you something though see all those marks inside my hat i brought my lucky hat those are deer that i've killed wearing this hat one two three four five six seven eight hmm i recommend everybody go to our website get one of these lucky hunting hats i don't have a lucky hat but yeah you go first go hold your bottle on top of your head i'm totally changing it up you go first okay your lucky hat will protect you you do it no you do it your lucky hat will protect you all right i'll do it chill out oh i can't balance it on my head i'll just hold it yeah don't eat anywhere in the region of i don't want to i don't want to get your hands because you still got to be able to butcher meat after this is all done you didn't really think we were going to do that did you all right put it on the string no i'm not going to make you do that what do you want to say 100 bucks to the guy that puts the arrow through his bottle just just for bragging rights i'd say just bragging just bragging rights who whoever puts their arrow through their bottle the other guy has to carry the most weight in elk quarters out of the mountains all right who's going first you ready i'm ready i'll let you go first revolt x let's see what we can do hey guys did you notice the wind much i'm not giving away my secrets we're going to go check it out oh i gotta give it up for him he got him right through his own logo and i'm oh man that's incredibly close it couldn't be much closer that was the first shot that wasn't any retakes no gimmicks oh i gotta get one shot look at that first shot each and seth takes the challenge good thing there was no money on this that was i should have went for the 100 30 yards one pound gave herself a haircut nice that's crazy so i suggest you start putting some marks inside that hat these bows are tack drivers i mean they are absolutely lethal somebody's going to ask what well how we have them set up ripcord aero rest custom bow equipment tactic micro site um this is a four actually five pin sight tight spot quiver we're shooting the gold tip we've got the hunter pro 340 shaft they are absolute tack drivers we love them thanks bowtech todd with bowtech these are incredible boats let's eat all right bring it in we're gonna have a prayer start eating hot dogs get your hot dogs here hot dogs peanuts peanuts hot dogs boys hats off let's bow our kind heavenly father god we come to you this evening thankful praising you for uh the glory of your creation here that we're enjoying we want to thank you for these um venison hot dogs we have and the other food we have the faith the fellowship that we can enjoy together all the families gathered here want to pray for our fellow outdoorsmen and those that go to the fields the streams and lakes this fall all across the world not only americans but we want to thank you for all the great freedoms that we have here and we want you to bless our evening we want to give you all the praise and glory we pray in christ's name amen amen amen all right boys break them out let's eat which one are you you're going to cross the hot dog cross i have no idea you don't you don't how many you want seven nine three guys just one i don't have that many so you're gonna take two i'll take one two turn don't burn okay go get them on the fire no he's the king of drops of them going in the fire oh who's the best in your family makes them golden probably when do the dads get to eat we're gonna have to we're gonna have to carve yeah and the moms are we're gonna have to carve a stick out of the forest yeah yeah i got the buns ready kids first period turn don't burn turn don't burn is my hot dog ready seth almost those are onions that's what old people that's what old people you know a s'more before your hot dog everybody took the stick so i was like i gotta eat something oh man that's a perfect toasting job do you ketchup mustard anything onions double onions pickles ketchup for gonna have to teach these kids how to eat a hot dog what about barbecue nobody's eating nobody's barbecue nothing yeah the hot dogs are just so good you don't need them right yeah do you want a hot bun i need a hot dog you need a hot dog i'm going with a course beer to butcher barbecue and mayo relish onion on my first dog this is not gonna be my last that i'm sure bro oh that bite that smoke flavor oh that's amazing hey we should have a hot dog eating contest we have 25 pounds how many do you think you can do remember that time i flung a hot dog at you and it whacked you right in the eyeball how far i forget gave me a black eye with her with a hot dog we were playing volleyball and he threw a hot dog i remember saw it coming [Music] um so what we've done it's the epitome of harvesting it processing it in such a way that you get um a little bit on the corner of your mouth a little bit right there you get to enjoy a beautiful summer evening just like this eating a venison hot dog something that you you harvested processed you know exactly what's in it you're putting in on your family's table something you can really be proud of and it's delicious absolutely delicious i love it toast them cameraman needs a hot dog i need a hot dog you want a hot dog i want a hot dog everybody wants a hot dog i know they want a hot dog i told you i would get onto my second hot dog now i am seth's over here enjoying himself uh let's see we got four deer hunter successful you guys have all gotten deer two you want a tournament he's gotten four you guys want to trim in the hot dogs next time sure let's do it this is what i'm doing so that's a great thing about hot dogs because these kids are all eating them if it was i don't know maybe ground meat into a burger or something like that some kids are kind of funny about those so the process that we showed you using the meat equipment make something like this with that trim that's still left in your freezer and guess what here it is the end of summer season hunting season here in ohio is right around the corner and we're cleaning out the freezer and making hot dogs so that's right recommend you do it so wanted to thank you for watching the video

next time see [Music] ya you", "ik1-o8WbINs": "[Music] hello everyone welcome welcome to our second episode of Juniper June and today we are making the quintessential gin cocktail the martini last week we made the Martinez a lot of people think that that is the predecessor of the modern martini and I'm gonna make you first the sort of first ever kind of published actual martini as it was labeled so let's just get into that what's everyone eating tonight so I'm using sip Smith of London Dry Gin London Dry Gin I don't believe actually has to be from London but it is a style all unto itself this particular distillery is only something like ten years old mmm they set up the distillery in 2009 to sort of bring back a copper pot distillation to gin which is really great so martinas recipe last week out and a half of gin we used an old Tom gin then and an ounce and a half of sweet vermouth a little bitters a little look startled liqueur and that was it so we come then to this drink which kind of state starts taking root in the 1890s and instead of an ounce and a half of sweet vermouth it's an ounce and a half of dry vermouth and this recipe is very similar to this fat recipe is very similar to that Martina's we don't have any bitters though and we don't have any liqueur but we do usually have a lemon twist in the original recipe so Alice and a half of the there we go London Dry Gin eyelets and a half of dry vermouth so that's just a one to one ratio for the original martini and a lot of people who drink martinis are probably like that's way too much vermouth and you know what it makes for a very different drink martinis are always stirred and I just learned today that the if you shake a martini that actually makes it a Bradford it's called a Bradford I didn't know that before all right Dominic's eating a Cassidy and having Bud Light sounds delightful yep there you go and what you get is a very sort of bright and savory lots of acid but it could probably go with it could probably handle the the turkeys of the world the more the more dark light meets the porks of the world that sort of thing we are going to or off into our martini glass we've also evolved into a martini glass remember the martinis wanted a coupe glass that's this one right here and you can garnish with an olive in fact it's an option but I like the tie-in with last week where we were garnishing with a lemon suave so just to kind of show the evolution of the martini Cheers and it I mean it's very vermouth heavy you can tell it's a it's a Y and heavy drink the I would drink it in the springtime when it's getting a little bit hotter out but because it's so vermouth heavy I definitely don't want it in heat in in the summer but a lot of there's there's just a lot of people who have written so much about just the martini having it either their favorite thing EB White said it is the elixir of quietude which I really like all right so then we we move on and I'm gonna do something that's not martini but is a martini but as far as I can tell it birthed the extra dry martini so we are we're gonna ditch our London Dry Gin and I'm gonna bring out my Plymouth because if I'm doing a dry martini an extra dry martini this for me has just a little more oomph to it rather than just hey I'm citrus hey I'm botanicals all right so now instead of it being an ounce and a half an ounce and a half we have a full three ounces of gin right and that is going to be pretty constant over these next three drinks in fact all of these drinks all of these next three drinks share the same base ingredients so actually I'm just gonna make two drinks right here and split them up amongst three glasses because why not all right so if we're pretending we're making one drip that's three ounces of gin and then after after 1900 the amount of vermouth slowly started going down here it was one to one and then it became two to one and then three to one and and today you can find martini recipes that are like 16 to 1 what the most recent one calls for is three ounces of gin and an eighth of an ounce of dry vermouth and it just so happens that most bar spoons are an eighth of an ounce I get to an eighth of an ounce in here as well but if you are at a bar if you're hurrying if you already have a bar spoon that is dirtied this method will save you some time okay so we actually have two drinks working here so I'm going for two eighths or one quarter this is huge every stir our our goal here is to get to about 25 percent dilution and we can stop and we can taste right here just stuff give us some framework and that is very strong still well yeah they they kept going down the people kept liking less and less from and even I know coward said the perfect martini should be made by filling a glass with gin and waving it in the general direction of Italy so the vermouth gets less and less all right I'm gonna I'm gonna strain all that off so that it doesn't keep diluting cuz it's right where I want it get a little more of that before I use this martini glass for something else I only have one martini glass right now so in the interest of good television we're gonna pour it back into a martini less alright so for all intents and purposes what I made here was a dry martini but as far as I can tell that this is the predecessor to the dry martini because it was published way before anyone ever published a an extra dry dry martini and so if you put a cocktail onion in here a cocktail onion in an extra dry martini it becomes a Gibson and that was first published in 1908 by William Booth be in the world the world's drinks and how to mix them so Gibson Cheers and I think that might have to work oh no no I'm getting the onion yeah yeah it adds a you know Oh opens up that opens up that dry vermouth and gives you a really kind of savory undertone I didn't think that that would change that that much but it does I'm not quite sure what I think about this yet this is my first time having a Gibson hmm all right Anthony and Cathy are starting happy hour with a drink they call the Belarus which is French for beautiful Russian st. Germain and seltzer yep Plus vodka and Contra yeah I remember you talking about that that sounds that sounds delicious I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to have you make me one of those when when I see you next all right I've I've had a moment to process this and I want to go back to just a straight one I kind of get some frame of reference yeah the onion mellows it out a lot it adds a lot of savory savory notes to Plymouth is already a pretty savory gin it's uh I was I was drinking it in front of my roommate the other day and she said smells like peaches and it kind of does I can see it but I more like cedar kind of kind of barky bark eat bark and citrus and pine needles that sort of thing so well well done wait a way to change a cocktail mr. mr. Boothby by just adding a different garnish I like it mm-hmm all right on to the next all right so this is the actual extra dry martini remember we did three ounces of gin and an eighth an ounce or a bar spoon of the what's it called vermouth of the vermouth all right and that that's it right there we can also garnish with a lemon twist or an olive but this is where olive start to get really big in in the kind of martini in the martini culture so this is where I'm gonna put the olive in and let's see how that changes I didn't expect the cocktail onions to change it that much but it was surprising I Mike my question to you all is what are you eating and cat said Cosmo Cheers hmm yeah that definitely ups the salt factor it gets a little less savory and you retain more of the sort of botanical notes that are present in the gin rather than sort of being smoothed out by the the savoriness of the cocktail onion that's that's a really nice comparison I'm glad I found this one because I almost didn't that's that's really nice mmm oh man yep yeah that gets that gets salty which which leads me to my next to my next trick is the so the the extra dry martini I said like I said the Gibson was published in 1908 and the extra dry martini didn't really start gaining popularity gaining traction until the 1950s and that's where where that's where we have it the martini had already been starting to lose vermouth steadily but this is where we see this really kick off this is where as no cop no coward would say the perfect martini should just be gin at a glass and then you say what's going on Italy another thing that I learned from me from a bartender that I worked with years ago man this must have been like 15 years ago he said this is this is how you make make a perfect martini and he he poured import gin in his in his glass and he just went for a million all right so this is this is now the dirty martini and you can make this any way that you want with as much olive brine as you want but the olives are the idea and I'm just going to put to all of them cuz that already has some juice on it and then because that olive brine was so briny before I'm just gonna do a bar spoon of of olive brine and give this just a toss dirty martini and that's a bar snack right there and that is if you have a bowl of popcorn or pretzels or bag of chips or some salty fries or something you can do away with all of that and just get it a dirty martini because that is that I think I think of the idea of that is just just a self repeating self-fulfilling prophecy of oh I'm gonna eat these bar snacks now oh I need another drink oh man I'm I'm hungry cuz I've drank a little I'm gonna have some more bar snacks oh no man there's so much salt and you get all that right here so you could probably just drink them forever if salts your thing are those cheese stuffed olives they are cheese stuffed olives I was a little disappointed because filthy labels them as blue cheese stuffed olives and I don't see any blue and the cheese it tastes more like feta which is still good you know it's a I'm not unhappy about it I would just like like the blue cheese because I think that would be amazing all right one more time original martini it's 50/50 gin and vermouth we use the London Dry Gin so it would stand up to the vermouth and it is it's standing out I can still taste the gin but going from this to this it's it's just night and day right this is a little more a little more lemon a tea than you know something where's my dry and then something like this this is this is a cocktail this is this seems like spiked lemonade but it is still good I think it does still have its place all right so we're looking at 1890s the next evolution of the Martinez which was last week we have early 1900s the the dry martini with the cocktail olive which is called a Gibson the original Gibson might have had more from Earth it from within it but this is this is what I found and I found relatively little on the earlier variations of that and just really savory I think that would go that would go really well with with fresh raw vegetables that would go really well with with white meat like a like a really nicely done chicken breast I as I'm envisioning it envisioning it I kind of want a lot of coarsely ground black pepper on it with maybe some maybe some green beans and mushrooms and it's actually what I had last night this green beans and mushrooms but I don't like that a lot as far as cheese maybe um maybe not cheese maybe charcuterie that would be that would be excellent Dominick never had a martini with an onion in it remember that awesome horseradish martini we had that one time that place is right down the street from my apartment it's called it's called Moscow on the hill and they make a horseradish vodka martini and it's it's just excellent I mean the the horseradish vodka by itself is just is just amazing I used to work at the restaurant across the street from that restaurant and we would just go over after shift and and drink horseradish vodka mm-hmm yep getting getting a little more salty but it still retains the gin which is nice and then this guy I mean even though I just put the one bar spoon of of olive brine in the olive just takes over and I'm glad I didn't do more because I can still taste the gin because I know it's there and it it holds up the olive bread there's a little bit of like a citrus backbone to the olive brine but all in all all very different drinks and the differences between these three are it's a matter of garnish you know you could very easily put four olives in here without any Brian and it would probably be the exact same thing there would probably be enough Brian on those olives to make a dirty martini but that's uh that's all I've got as far as far as drinks but this is this is a cooking channel so let's eat alright so immediately when I thought martini I thought that I wanted ulster x' but it's a weird time in food production and I live in Minnesota so I didn't go with oysters and then I were and I had some shrimp in the freezer so we're gonna go with that I've got some grapes cuz they're always interesting they get a little bit of sweet a little bit of tannin they dry you out a little maybe make you taste a little more some oranges for sweetness and also for for a little bit of acid you know what I have a lemon here do I have a knife yeah I have a knife on my wine key let's get some some lemon on the shrimp maybe maybe we'll get get a little more out of our out of our experience here there we go alright so sweetness and acidity and then this is the this cheese is a a comp date it's it's a French cheese it starts out very light and then it has a like a really strong maybe not strong it has like a bold finish that gets very savory pretty quickly you know almost almost grassy someone can get a little spicy - mm-hmm I didn't start tasting it until just now and now it's just full all over my mouth just a little bit spicy kind of slight notes if like hey and now it's just very slowly slowly coming down so I thought that would be nice with the martini as well mmm and then some some real acid alright let's let's do this all right Kat says Rochester New York has an amazing olive bar at a local grocery store that has blue cheese olives in an orange frying oh that sounds amazing it completely changed my martini so delicious that that does sound that does sound really great that sound that sounds amazing so the blue cheese in the olive I'm assuming they were green olives in an orange Brian yeah that's so that's already a lot going on there and then you had yeah gin - will you drink vodka martini so you add anything to it yeah and then that's gonna flavor your drink ever so slightly yeah I love it that's that sounds amazing it's right by Dominique's house road trip everybody let's go go to Dominique's house all right let's eat if you haven't let me know what what you're eating yet yeah let me let me know I'd love I'd love to know what you're eating what you're drinking okay this is a shrimp you know I wanted I wanted shellfish I wanted sweet I want and savory I wanted a little bit of salt and I think that the original martini is too much for it it might work with with some other kinds of shellfish maybe with with oysters in fact I think it would would work really well but it doesn't the shrimp doesn't hold up to it at get the shrimp gets lost Lorenzo is having cookies and spotted cow man I miss spotted cow for though for those of you that don't know that see this out there in the the internet for perpetuity spotted cow is a Wisconsin exclusive brewery is called New Glarus and they do a couple really great things they do a couple really weird things but so do all breweries it's a it's a weird time for for brews what I really appreciate about them is that they don't hop the hell out of everything like every other brewery out there now you know one or two of you brews is fine but that when that's what you base your thing on I I've gotten nothing to drink you know cookies and spotted cow that's nice all right let's keep going on this on this shrill train by the way shrimp tails make for an awesome stock whether you're making a chicken stock or a beef stock or something like that if you've got someone who's allergic to shellfish in your life you know don't do that but if you've got them and you're just gonna throw them away and you don't see any consequences to it like freeze them throw them in your neck stock they add such a wonderful wonderful element to that stock I love it okay still having that shrimp on my you know what I was talking what's you know ah that's nice that's really good the Gibson with the shrimp I wonder you know because I had cocktail sauce on it too I wonder if somebody had that invention that that combination and then decided I'm going to invent the Bloody Mary instance a really nice really nice combination all right you the the dry martini works the best so far the you know this the the shrimp are very are very savory it's it's a mild flavor but it's it lasts and the dry martini just kind of allows it to go and fills your mouth without overpowering anything the the Gibson and the shrimp's work together to make something else and the dry martini let the shrimp shine with a little bit of something extra that was nice that was really nice cat is eating homemade meatballs with donated pork and beef from Anthony's cat when I when I read that when I had my mouth full I read you were you had homemade meatballs with detonated pork and beef and I couldn't say anything but now now I can because I have no food in my mouth Dominique what are some of the best microbrews in New York when Dominique was in Boston she had the most incredible oysters and she doesn't even like oh yeah it fresh versus even even flowing in a short way even if it's just an hour flight it makes a world of difference fresh is always gonna gonna blow your mind I went to I went to upstate New York when I was 16 or 17 and I had what did I had shrimp there I had shrimp there and they blew my mind out what that what the difference was and I couldn't eat shrimp back here for years because it just wasn't didn't work for me yeah it's a it's a mine it's a game-changer what what fresh means all right so what are the pros and cons of a gin martini versus a vodka martini a good question Dominique you know a vodka martini it one in salt it's all in your preference it's only your preference of what liquor you like to drink I'm doing a different variation on a gin martini plus a vodka martini next week and I was gonna kind of compare the difference then but I think that the vodka martini is probably much more about much more about the garnish and maybe the vermouth used and the gin that this is and I'm not me I don't when I say this I don't mean it as a put-down to the vodka martini at all but this seems more like a cocktail this seems more like several different elements working together to make a completely different drink and when I drink a vodka martini and it's still it's still good and it has a different idea to it when I drink vodka martini it's more like drinking a glass of vodka with with a garnish in it which is not there's nothing wrong with it so it's I guess complexity might be might be the thing but if you don't like gin which I know a lot of people don't so it's a very it's a very opinionated drink it has a strong opinion and a lot of people have a strong opinion if you don't like gin one these ingredients do change it slightly and two there's also nothing wrong with that you know if you want to come back to it later come back to it later if you want to try different things things later and go you know my mom famously tells a story about how she can't have gin because she had ruined it for herself in in her 20s by by partying too hard II and my coworker about five years ago made her a Vesper which I'm gonna make in a couple of weeks and that's a gin and vodka martini like cocktail and she loved it she you know she she she was so thankful that that she could enjoy a gin cocktail again so there's something for everybody and jinns are so widely different I have I'm just gonna bring them out okay so there's one variety that I'm missing which is Dutch Jennifer and that's the granddaddy of all gin that's where gin started it's a little sweeter a little more heavy but it does have the botanicals actually I have I have an equity here and equity is more like a shorter Norwegian and Swedish style gin it has a lot of oil panicles in it but it is kind of its own category of thing so I would say that a Dutch Jennifer rest somewhere in between a gin and a an aqua v even though aqua V isn't necessarily like sweet and heavy it's just kind of a at least this one is just kind of a different style of Jamie this one kind of smells like dill pickles okay and it's pretty nice alright I'm getting sidetracked you guys have some good questions all right Swiftwater and Rohrbach are both local Rochester breweries that are pretty awesome that sounds awesome oh I was gonna go through these so there's on the far end over here would be Dutch Cheever that's one category of gin then we have old Tom gin which I went through in detail last week watch watch that it's kind of a renewed thing because we lost this for watch watch that it's kind of a renewed thing because we lost this for a while and then the old standby is is London Dry Gin I don't believe it has to be from London I have to double-check that but it's very bright and very juniper forward and it has a lot of botanicals and it's what a lot of people think that they don't like in a gin when they would probably like this guy or this guy and then this is Plymouth Jen Plymouth is both a brand and the style it comes from comes from Plymouth and it it's very it only has like seven ingredients there's coriander and cardamom and lemon and orange and juniper and something else and it's it's beautiful I really enjoy it it's a very mild gin while still having a lot of a lot to offer so there are for all intents and purposes for different styles of gin and I think there's you know there's something for everyone even if you're not going to drink it on the rocks which very few people do there's probably a cocktail out there for you hmm Shh Anthony if you think you don't like gin you never meant the right Jen I mean that's that that's correct I think that you know there there are some probably some people out there that are just that just will never will never like it but you know 99% of people I think that's correct you just haven't met the right gin and you know just just try some stuff smell some stuff get to know a good bartender and go this is what I don't like about gin and then they if they're good and they know their stuff they can go oh cool you probably don't like all of this category over here like here's this really cool cedar gin and actually that's my favorite martini I couldn't find any in the last couple of days is vikre makes a cedar gin and I love a martini with a lemon twist with cedar vikre cedar gin it's just my favorite martini so there's another one and that it's not very juniper forward it especially in the martini you get a really nice kind of woodsy feel out of your martini so all right Dominique you used a lemon twist a cocktail onion and a green all of this garnishes how much do you think the garnish changed the drink completely the garnish changed the drink completely from well I mean these two these two are exactly the same drink except for the garnish this one is exactly the same drink except for the garnish plus and other explosive ala juice and they're all very different this it just gets more savory and more savory ever all the time I'm drinking it and now there's a little hint of onion not like a stinky onion but like a like a French onion chip onion and that's really nice this is actually this is actually tasting like an aqua v right now let me give this a smell yeah this has a more a lot more going on than this guy but this is kind of the mild version of of this of the aquavit I'll have to do an entire episode on aqua V but maybe maybe later after I got a gin and we'll do something a little bit more towards the other side of the palate like rum or something like that but then we we get over here and it's the same drink I mix them in this exact same jar and we have more juniper notes we have more we have a little bit more citrus the botanicals of that Oh coriander wonderful yeah of the the Plymouth are coming out but it has just a little bit of saltiness from that that all of the saltiness that I don't get over here this is letting off a very savory quality this is letting off a very salty quality and then this is just a bar snack all right got really distracted there I was having shrimp okay let's try the shrimp with the dirty martini hmm okay I get it shot shots and leaders is gonna be the spin-off of chutes and ladders yeah there we go we could name it shots and leaders now that works with the cheese oh yeah that that wine background really comes in that's that's amazing I really like that okay let's try the this this Gibson whoa completely different yeah that that onion just brings out all punch so the the original martini the 50-50 just kind of smoothed it out and it's a beautiful experience I'm still tasting it the onion in the Gibson just proud oh it's uh all those kind of punchy grassy spicy notes that was really good all right extra dry Dominique's of my reaction is priceless that does nothing but with the remain unchanged and I'm actually really surprised I wanted to do that again yeah I don't know if that's disappointing I I really thought that mmm okay the dirty martini works better than the dry martini but they both relatively it everything remains unchanged it's not super impressive but these two were just wonderful with that with that she's for different reasons the cheese or don't change the cheese doesn't make it good or bad not as bad as I thought but it's not good it's not good with the with the onion oranges and onions don't go together unless you caramelize the onions first words of the wise caramelize you're on in the onions first the more you know let's get the seed out of here this is the most seedy orange I've had in years nope absolutely not I can already tell you that this one's not gonna work either this was way too salty for the orange so and I have a feeling that the same is going to be true of the grape but let's just check it out you well that's fun that's just very it made it more full and I think that's cuz the grape made my mouth water and then I I got all of all of this and even though the the dry vermouth is dry it does make the drank sweeter than if it was just Jen doesn't work again it's not horrible it just doesn't it just doesn't work so maybe keep I mean this this worked really well with what the shrimp and the cheese also not horrible but it yeah it is horrible I like the the more the salt keeps going with the the gray alright it's finished to this out and do do some lemon dominique asks if i had to pick one of the martinis to recommend which one would you say is the best um I would say it depends what you're eating because as we saw they bring out a lot of different things the most interesting to me was the Gibson but we've already established on the show that I like things that surprised me and I have never had this before and it surprised me how much just the omission of the olive and the addition of the onion changed the cocktail that was really nice I do also like the original martini because it kind of shows you what's uh what's going on where it came from the evolution of everything you can kind of tease out the flavors that made this into what this is and again this is the only one I use to London dragged in in and because of the the huge sort of juniper and citrus flavor it almost has more of a lemonade quality than anything to it it's really it's really nice these guys this is this is a bar snack I don't know any other way to describe that I can't see this going with anything that you're eating in fact I read the first thing I read about how a pair of food with martinis was that the martini is meant to go with the olive in the glass so it like these do these go with with the olives in the glass maybe pick out things that go with olives like like a charcuterie board or like I mean or or like she it did well with the cheese so that's cool I would recommend going through all of them starting with the with the Martinez so you know where where you where you start from so look at last week's episode and I give you the recipes relatively right away I mean within like the first 10 minutes you'll know you'll get the recipe and then you can see like where that came from and then what the next evolution of it is and how these really came to be their things if you like salt do this one if you're pairing it with with a steak probably go with the onion you know so that's that's a big complicated answer but it's also what I used to do in the wine bar you know what's uh you know what do you recommend well what are you having well what other wine deal heck you know nothing's perfect for everybody alright acid mm-hmm it's alright it's just kind of the the lemon it's kind of lemon on lemon right maybe we'll get something different with the Plymouth because that is a different jet Oh let's do this oh that's nice that's kind of - to savory flavors just kind of laying over each other and existing in different kind of planes on your palate it's uh it's one of those things that was an interesting experiment that I'm glad I did it but I don't find myself like craving another another Lake of the lemon and another sip of this guy oh that's good that's really in your face that's acid and salt and juniper and you know some spices in there I don't know so I guess if you're if you're eating something acidic do do the dry martini but let's not forget about the dirty oh yeah even more so it it's the it it's fair glass I guess acid works well with with olive juice all right well with that said we are fast approaching the hour mark when I had all of these already made at like 12 minutes I was like oh man I'm gonna run out of stuff to talk about but this has been really fun I really like doing these kind of evolutions of of the cocktail next week we're gonna see a little bit more of the martini and sort of wrap that up as we sort of evolve past the traditional martini thank you for joining me for Juniper June you know this whole thing came from a request from from Anthony and Cathy to do a martini episode and when I looked at everything there was to look at I said there's way too much I want to do I'm doing an entire month so juniper June you guys get it all right Newton if you watch Doctor Zhivago you know onions and lemons go together especially in your own private train oh [Laughter] yeah you are not lying I'm gonna cut it off there guys thank you for everything that you do for me and do for the channel I really appreciate the support remember to like the video share these with people that might need drink recipes or or recipes in the kitchen and you know join me next week for more on the martini in a little bit of a different direction [Music]", "xZf3l4uU9_E": "welcome to moomoomath and science in this video I'd like to talk about unit rate a ratio is a comparison of two numbers or measurements the objects being compared are called the terms of the ratio if the two terms are different units it is called a rate for example a 12 ounce coke costs 84 cents the rate is 84 cents for 12 ounces the ratio has cents announces so you can write this rate as a fraction 84 o of 12 or using the : 84 cents to 12 both expressions mean that you pay 84 cents for every 12 ounces of coke a unit rate is when the quantities are expressed as a ratio of 1 for example 7 cents for one ounce so let's work some unit rate problems let's find the unit rate for each problem the unit rate for you get a hundred oranges from 20 trees so I'm gonna write this in fraction form a hundred over 20 and that needs to equal 1 over X so now I solve for X I will cross multiply this so that gives me 100 is equal to 20 X will cross multiply and solve for X so I will divide each side by 20 and X is equal to 100 divided by 20 which is equal to 5 so X is equal to 5 I now will rewrite this as 100 over 20 is equal to 5 over 1 I could write this as a hundred : 20 is equal to 5 : okay now let's look at the next one for every 225 calls I make five cells I will write this in fraction form set this equal to one solve cross multiply 225 is equal to 5x X is equal to 45 you write this 225 over five is equal to 45 over one or 225 colon 5 is equal to 45 to 1 go ahead and show you a shortcut all you really need to do is I'm going to write it in fraction form you go 224 miles in 2 hours so I'm going to write this in fraction form is equal to 1 over X is just divide the numerator by the denominator which is 220 4 divided by 2 is 112 this is equal to X so 2 112 is your unit rate and so I can rewrite that as 224 over 2 is equal to a hundred and 12 over you", "rfQRZlabRBs": "right lesson 1-8 optimizations with linear programming graph is system of inequality of inequalities named the coordinates of the vertices of the feasible region and then you find the maximum and the minimum values of the given function this is the function that we need to graph okay let's grab this one first y greater or equal to 1 and Y smaller or equal to 4 we have one of this line right here and 4 is right here let me draw this line alright now when you drop inequality you need to shade it so I'm gonna I will give you the financial later once I'm done with all of this graphing so what is when keep in mind the the region of solution is in between this line so in in between these two lines now that's kind of you to grab this line right here now to grab this line let's try to simplify this one first so we have for y greater than or equal to 6x minus 32 let's simplify this by 4 and y greater than or equal to 6 divided by 4 left 6 before or we have 3 over 2x and then my necessary to divide by 4 you have 832 divided 4 is at 8 now after that let's do the graphing now when you grab this line let me transform it into simpler term first while greater than or equal to 3 over 2x minus 8 all right this line let's get a table value for this one Alex and why table value not when X 0 Y is negative way but I didn't want to use all the wasted negative H you know a bit I didn't draw the graph here for that small number negative value so I'll let me try to find something else that make X if X equal to 2 3 now you look fine now let make X equal to 4 ok so when my egg is 4 4 times 2 I'm sorry 4 times 3 12 12 divided by 2 there's 6 6 minus 8 you got minus 2 so if my X is 8 you have to actually let me do the division first 8 divided by 2 year for format 5 by 3 you got 12 12 minus 8 you get 4 so now you have 2 points to graph the line so 0 or throw wine for X negative 2 so Y where Y for X for y negative 2 so we have X 4 y 92 somewhere here that's one point and then when the egg is eight your Y is 4 somewhere here so when you have that let's roll the line okay now where did you grab what did you do the shading okay so look at this IRA here why greater than so when it is greater than you shed above the line greater than above the line so this is the region of solution we shed above the line okay now let's go to our last line let me try to convert this into simpler terms first we have y greater than or equal to you divide this one by two you have a negative one over two x and you also have a plus two so you have this line you need to graph y then or equal to negative one over two x and then plus two a fine table values of this equation okay x and y now I get a 0 0 Y is 2 now when you act this to say f is 2 2 times 1/2 negative 2 divided by 2 D of 1 negative 1 plus 2 you get 1 0 Y 2 when your egg is to your Y is one okay when you have that last graph what should be on the the point why it's not like that - Oh make mistake on that that's why should be here - 2 1 now make it the wrong point is negative 1 no 2 1 here that's why they're wise something wrong with this okay okay now the region sharing region this is greater than or equal to looking at the original equation this is greater than or equal to so you said above the line now it seems like right now we have a common shedding region to me where this one and give you a proper shading of the answer so you have another point here as a vertices so this is the shading region laughter I'm on this one now we have four vertices actually yep one two three and four this all the intersection of the solution vision after that let's answer the question named recall the night of each vertices okay that's well you can represent letter or you don't want to represent letter that's up to you I'll just name it right away that's it problem from here I'll just put ABC easier it'll be C and B okay now at Point a what do we have here since this you have starting from here you have negative 4 and then you have 1 2 3 4 90 4 and 4 and then for point B 1 B you have this one 8 and then 1 2 3 4 8 and 4 for Point C Point C you have this one as 6 and then 1 and the last one for body the last vertex vertex is D which is 2 & 1 ok now after that need to find the maximum and the minimum values of the given function not to do so you need to start to this each of these vertices into this equation down here let's start with a first doubleday so job is one ounce negative six and your time oxygen negative four and then you plus three times y which is four let me do this one so yeah negative six times negative negative six times negative four 24 24 and then you plus with 12 that give you 36 that's perform nearly 36 after that let's go on to point B point B up negative six x is 1 8 then last with three times for the up negative 6 times 8 and and you plus 12 they give you negative 36 so that poem see negative 6 times 6 and then G Plus with 3 times 4 so 6 times 6 is negative 6 negative 36 over negative 36 your minus 12 give energy plus whether or not - you plus further to give you negative 24 and then the last point which is last for this which is it is 6 and you times by average is 2 and then 3 plus 3 I'm sorry this is not this times 1 mistake so you have stirred negative 36 + 1 negative 33 first one select last week this one here negative 12 plus 3 equal to negative so among this four vertices we can stress find the maximum and minimum value of this inequality system of inequality so from here so therefore this is the maximum there is the biggest number 36 and the negative number is the minimum number so the maximum and right this one for you maximum value equal to 36 and the minimum minimum equal to negative 36 let's move on number two do the same thing graphing let me start by graphing this function or this inequality X in between 8 2 & 6 so you have to rewrite here then you draw one line first and six somewhere here okay so that let's move on to this one let me start biased simplify this one so this will never check Mary ground grabbing it me let me wrap this one for y I'm did then awake forward to negative x plus 2 when you device went by for you why it has been equal to negative 1 over 4x and then plus 2 divided by 4 you're gonna have 1 over to have the point okay all right now it's done so this one X's and Y's so when your egg is 0 uy yes zero point I have when your X is 4 3 4 so 4 4 times 1 is 4 4140 won't have negative ones you have negative 1 plus half R ab-negative have to let graph this line ok X 0 y have middle and then when your egg is for the Y's negative 1/2 so negative let's draw okay oh by the way the shelling vision this is in between and it's Lance all above the line like this it seems like there are somewhere in between here okay how about our last line right here in the middle here let me transform this into simpler form first so I have people on baseline for why smaller than or equal to negative 2x plus 24 okay so I try to divide both sides by four wise one dynamic 4 to negative 2 over 4 negative 1 over 2x plus 24 divided by 4 you got 6 let's work on this so when you add a little X 0 X & Y when you x is 0 X 0 here's your y 6 when your X is 2 2 times 1 - 2 divided by 2 1 2 negative 1 plus 6 you got 5 okay now let's graph this line 0 + 6 X 0 y 6 is 2 your Y is 5 when you have that last graph roll the line and since this line here is smaller than a quote it's smaller so we shade below the line okay now since like the intersection of the shading of the region of an says it's fall under I mean inside this for this section so let me try to share it properly okay that is the region of answer now where poverty is as well one two three and four let me name is one ask W X Y Z a pussy-ass w x y and z okay now let's name the various but it says of this region so starting from the W first W then W yep two and five then X for X you have six and three why why you have six and negative 1 and Z the last one you have 2 and 0 ok after that now let's write a calculate for the minimum and the maximum value of this system starting from W first ok working on this one just 6x starting with W first you have 6 times X which is 2 plus 7 times y which is 5 ok 12 + 35 + 35 that have 47 that's 47 and then number X so actually have 6 time equity 6 plus 7 times y which is 3 so you have 36 the three six plus with 21 that give you 57 point y 6 times 6 which is the X plus 7 times negative 1 which is 2 y so you have 36 of 36 minus 7 they give you twenty nine and then last one you have 6 times 2 which is X plus 7 times 0 is y so this will have 12 all right now from this value you have the maximum is for maximum 57 and the minimum which is 12 so maximum value maximum equal to 57 and minimum equal to 12 okay now let's continue to number three or the instruction you need make a birthday cake yellow or we have yellow cake that sell for $25 and strawberry cake ok that's there for 35 dollars now that's the same side decorating okay now for yellow cake need two hours for jello cake so which mean two hours you have one you locate in which you can earn $25 and from strawberry cake it will require three hours to makes public heads so within three hours to earn $35 because you make one strawberry now that represent first okay I will represent xed as the yellow cake let's say yellow cake and then why I will represent this as strawberry cake strawberry cake okay so now jello cake for yellow cake you will earn $25 within two hours but why would you make one and then for strawberry cake you will earn $35 yeah within three hours how many of each type how many of each type of cake should be made to maximize revenue so we see let me look at for Less required to make both of them or just either one of them or could be both of them or not just one either one of them you see first okay so it's it seems like the instruction not required to to make both but it could be possible that I will be you can make both to reduce the the maximum profit or just reduce one of the two to maximize the profit okay this is the let's get the revenue let's see first you have 450 hours so with 150 hours let's see how many of this scale you can make okay so we will do that you just get 200 so we're in for wonder this is within this time rate 450 hours if you want to produce this if you want to reuse previous cake using this hour we use yellow cake alone you will have [Music] 450 you divide by 2 hours that give you 200 and 220 five jello cake and which mean that in this case your strawberry crepe is 0 but if you want if you don't worry if we use or spend all this time to be use only the yellowcake it will give you a thing 450 hours did you divide by 3 they'll give you 150 k 250 cakes now assuming that you using this hour produce either either one of the cake you know either producing this probably cake or gel okay now let's try to find this profit by producing this cake first let's say well so let make some shoe of our points in this case not if for example if your yellow cake is 350 cakes at 225 case then your Sabri cake is 0 let's see how much you will earn from producing only the yellow cake so 20 and 25 you multiplied by 1 of yellow cake it cost $25 so 225 multiplied by $25 that will give you 5,000 like this they said this is the profit 5,000 to $625 let's say if you've reduced if you produce only the strawberry cake so which mean you have zero yellow cake well strawberry takes 150 cakes let me see how much you earned by producing only the strawberry cake so 150 you multiplies by $35 the cost of one strawberry cake 35 that will give you five thousand five thousand two hundred and fifty dollars all right now it seems like in this case now it seems like we producing 225 yellow cakes and zero strawberry cake to maximize the profit as you can see using this strategy you produce more you produce more revenue let's see what if fall in between this I want to know if you produce the yellow cake and strawberry cake together will it give you the number was higher than death okay so let's bring this one up a little bit let's say this time right here you will produce let me try the fun because two hours with three I say miss Kay let's say you for you six yell okay maybe you're sick sell yell okay you're gonna take you're gonna spend six hours on the yellow cake with and we were twelve to our sorry you'll produce six yell okay you will spend four hours on the strawberry cake so in other word to find the time of you strawberry cake you using four hundred forty and fifty you - the time spending on the yellow clip this K which is a six cake with 12 hours after that you divide it by 3 then you will have 146 46 for the strawberry cake now let's see what this is will producing how much will it produce so you work on this was six multiplied by 25 and then 146 x 35 and you + together so 6 times by 25 plus with 146 x 35 it gives you a five thousand two hundred and sixty dollars right now it seems like our growth and go up like this okay so it seems like the more you try to grow I'll try to increase the number of the yellow cake is supplies the profits going up so if you produce more I believe that this problem you're gonna go up also until the time that you return 250 25k and she's going down to become 0 so these are we going down to become 0 so which mean that are in this case to maximize the revenue as you can see the growth of it as you increase the number of jell-o cake you increase also the revenue as you continue to increase it will increase the revenue until you reach this five thousand six hundred and twenty five dollar is the maximum revenue you can produce within a given time period four hundred and fifty hours so in this situation where we're trying to do this work without graphing so as you analyze the given together we can see that to produce to make the maximal revenue we will produce two hundred and twenty-five jello cake and zero strawberry cake let me write the answer for you so simply in this case in order for us to produce as how many of each type of the cake should be made to max whatever in revenue so you're producing for the yellow cake reproduce it 225 and was probably cake strawberry we produced none to maximize the revenue right number four number four we do the same thing we're trying to do this without graphing but an alive by analyzing the given okay now looking at the given together we have the Midway freight train how fun that 4,200 pounds cargo has capacity of four and that and 80 cubic feet clean up small package okay let me represent X a small package first to that easy to see so let's say X equally small package and a small package weigh 25 pounds is a 25 pounds with three five pounds then we can assume three cubic feet and that and the charge five dollars okay you earn five dollars under the arrowhead five dollars so X for small package 25 pound with that word weight from the five pound and take up space of three cubic feet and charge $5 for each of this small package and I said that for y lips represent as big this system because more they use large is everything large and polite large package by package they'd be weigh 250 pounds each and and take up space of five she'll be feet and that then charges for $1 $1 all right now let's try to looking at this together all right the the maximum way that the free train can howl is 4,200 pounds is the maximum way when with the given maximum space we just fall on that and 80 should be equipped this is the maximum that it can reach now we all have be given a read the question first before we analyze this situation together okay question find the number of each type of package that should be placed on a train car to max my revenue all right so the question what were you what will you work on this will you how many how many will you put on the train car is it should we put all small should we put all large or should we put all combined and small together so that we can maximize the revenue so we need to analyze the situation together to find the maximum and the minimum and what for in between it so that we will know what is the biggest the muck to what should we do to maximize our revenue in this case okay and I try to think before you start again we try to do this problem without graphing so let's try to let's say that we will put on put all the small package on the train car without using the large package and after that we will use all the large package on the train car without using a small package I try to work on that and after that let's see what for in between if you see it increasing or decreasing and we can really find the maximum and the minimum well revenue of this situation now let's say if you want to put all the small on the country and how many of this small package can be put on this car train again okay now to do this to do this part let's see car train are small for small package weigh 25 pounds so this is 4200 so you have 4,000 to let you divide by 25 you can see that based on weight you will have based on weight X is equal to 1168 package but if it is based on the capacity this way to take up four hundred eighty divided by three we do 160 package of small package I'm sorry so now which one should we choose if we choose this one 68 it will be too big for this space to to be occupied even though it fit with this way but it's too large but for this place to hold so therefore 160 can accommodate both I was only one state 160 can accommodate both the space and the way so we will so X 160 is for the number the maximum number that we can put on the country now for the Y okay Y one packet weigh 50 pounds so we have 402 a 4200 divided by 50 they give you an 80 y equal to 84 package packages based on the way and four based on the space it occupies 480 divided by five that will give you 96 okay now what should we do with this if we getting if we get this this number it can accommodate both of this one but if you get this 96 well it will fit with this space but it too large is too heavy for this so therefore to a number they can accommodate both the weight and the space its occupy is 84 in other word if X is 160 then your Y is 0 in this space if Y is 84 which means your X is 0 when we have this idea that try to find the maximum minimum value at this point at the point 160 and 0 what is the value what is the picture the profit also it is the revenue that we can make from producible from putting all these small packages on the country so one small package is cost for charge $5 so 160 times by 5 so this you'll find the last time I find I will give you 800 so if I have this as $800 at this point about the other point of 0 of this and 80 for small packages of large packages so yep 84 times by $1 for each of this light pipe packages so you have this us-only $672 alright so now we can see that we seems like we we we put all the small packages on the country and not with the 84 not with not the large sorry let me repeat so in this K to maximize as you can see the value to maximize the revenue we reproduce we will put only this small package on the country because if you put only the large one you are not going to remark smile your revenue but let's try to test if we try to put combine the lodgings more together on the country will we maximize it will be good at an 80-pound bed or will be it fall in between these tools then we can know the flow go up or go down another thing that if we're going to produce five fine now 1125 a I say five this is it be just five of the [Music] small packages if you have to justify of this we'll see how much we will take on this in space and also in weight so I think if you do a few calculations like with it before you buy if it you can just five a Phi of this one is three cubic feet if I'm gonna be 15 so 480 you minus 15 you have only 465 and then you divide by 8 divided by 5 that will give you 93 right it basing on the way this is going to be 93 but 93 is too big for this number because the smallest one is 84 so this reason we're not going to take this as the value for the large package so we go on the pound on the way so Phi of this Y so you have 2 or 25 times by they give you 125 and then 4200 - sorry let me repeat so this number of working with with the capacity so it not gonna fit with this expressive need to occupy too large or 84 so we work on the pound the weight of this large package up still we produce we put on five of a small package on the car train so 4200 - 125 and then we divide by this 50 so we will use on the 80 1.5 which is a sound with an above with this the more we produced this the less you'll be produced this one so let's see how much we got in this case with a bigger than this or in-between this number so after that trying to represent inside so one of these charge $5 so you fight a fight $25 plus 1 of this charge $1 so plus eighty one point five times by $8 so it seems like you producing 606 $27 alright so this value is in between these two value a hundred and 672 so I simply you have this is the minimum value and this is the maximum value in this case revenue so as you can see the flow the more you increase this the more you increase the revenue so as you continue to increase the number of small packages on the country every time you increase it with every time you will increase the revenue as well so as you continue to in visit the revenue we are continue to increase until it reached the 800 and that when you have zero of the large package and the country and has only the small package so in this situation to maximize the revenue you will produce only you Selena projects you will put only the small packages on the train car so question how many of is your package you should be placed on twin town so for you real place 160 small packages and 0 and 0 large large package and what is the maximal what is the maximum revenue per Patrick train car as you can see a while ago the maximum value and the maximum revenue is $800 for each of the Train town okay so our last number in this lesson which is number 5 okay number 5 read the instruction together situation to see whether we need to produce one of these or both of this together using plastic through the plan processes up to 1,200 tons of plastic with at least three times three a 300 tons my fresh process for food drink there's a food to an X for food drink see Jim container drink on Tina's and it is at least they should be bigger than or equal to three and they're in this case as in ton and you earn it one per the profit the profit of producing food this is a great word for let me read in there for food containers all right never food containers for food per ton for breathing food container is $1,750 live a full container and then for why why is the wild represent us drink containers okay drink containers now what ring container one in this case it at least bigger than or equal to 450 tons and you will earn $20 per time $20 per time okay underneath the situation must be to use all of this or just one of this to maximize the profit let me represent a list must be processed for container Wow and this must be processed all right so register must be right I think maybe that the keyword must be must be here so which mean that we have to produce both of this together by the question how many of these should we produce to maximize the profit in this case okay so we must release blow of this because and this must be free process for food container and 451 must be produced for dreaming tender so we have to produce all of these together the question again how many should we produce each of this right now let's start first let me is beginning with this this is the smallest value of food for less number of time that will be produced for drink container of food drink container food drink sorry food food container not drink mistake if a food container okay so this is the smallest number which will be used for food container and his smallest number we reproduce for green container all right let's say let me try to represent this as the food container and drink and dinner together if we're going to produce 300 let's say we put the value and this is a 117 point 50x that for the price each time the be used for food in container plus with $20 time with Y which is the prize that we produce or week or the profit that we earn from producing each tons of green container so one got this equation they're trying to find the lowest one for X so let's say in this case if we produce only a smallest number of day so we have seven 10.50 to multiply by the smallest number of obvious three hundred plus twenty x now in this case we have one thousand two and hundred tons so if we produce three hundred of the food container then the rest we broke belongs to dream container so drink so 300 ton you still have one more 900 times of this so let's see how much you earn from purchasing using only the smallest number of ton on food container because it is the smallest one the borderline so you have 17 you have seventeen point five x three under plus plus with 20 times by 900 and that will give you twenty three thousand two hundred and fifty dollars if we reuse this much of this one now let's say you we try to increase this a little bit more now we will try to test more a bit on this let's say and now I've got to increase the number of tons I'm producing the food container so in other word let me put another one I will use 17 150 I've been pleased by 10 tons or less a wife of 500 sir for this one's 400 ton producing on this number on this because food container $20 last not if we using 400 tons on food container than the rest of the way which is 800 will belongs to the ring container let's see how much we earn by producing this 400 tons of food container and 900 tons of drink container so 17.5 multiplied by 400 plus with 20 x 800 you have only $23,000 okay now as you can see the moment you increase the number of the number of tons of food container the lower you will get your profit in this case so the more you increase the number of food container the more you decrease the profit you earn so therefore as you can see if you continue to increase this you will decrease this continually as well so the more you increase this module decrease the profit so therefore this is the maximum value of this so how much should you question the middle question what is the profit if the plan marks in my processing all right they don't ask for we need food container harmony dream container they ask for what is the profit so therefore the profit is in this case twenty three thousand two hundred and fifty dollars", "zx4Y9okiRmo": "this video I'm going to explain relate customer units of weight so we will follow the same procedure and we will keep in our mind if we want to convert between units of weight or units of capacity or units of width or length or anything like that or mass we will order from smaller to larger our units so look here the smallest units here I have owns then pound is greater than bones and turn is the greatest one okay so if I'm going to convert from owns to pound or from pound to turn I'm going to divide but if I want to convert from ton to pound I have to multiply from power to also have to multiply again so I will use the same procedure under which the same I am going to convert it from smaller to larger we have to divide but from larger to smaller we are going to multiply okay you have to keep in your mind when we have to divide when we have to multiply again ohms is the smallest unit of weight then pound is greater than almost pound is this downturn and greater than pounds so tone is the greatest unit now again you have to keep in your mind these things horsepower turn if we are going to convert from almost a pound on a part on we have to divide turn to pound mountains we have to multiply again from smaller to larger we have to divide from larger to smaller we have to multiply so in this box we have units of weight each 16 ounces or all's lock this is different not the fluid ounces this is also only because this depends on waitwhat fluid also depends on capacity so 16 oz equine 1 pound 16 equal 1 pound and 1 pound equals 16 ounces and each turn equals 2,000 pounds and 2,000 pounds equal 1 turn so in this listen it's so easy because we talked how to convert between units and now we have an idea how to compare to how to divide how to multiply so I will go direct to the problems now look at this example I will study this example in this example I will convert 3000 lb means pound to tongue and B means pound t means ton okay and oz means ounces so if I want to convert 3000 and B to one ton or 3000 pounds to one ton I have to divide why because lb is smaller than 1 so I will divide them I will divide by what by 2,000 so 3000 lb is 3000 divided by 2,000 now if I want to divide these numbers if dividend and divisor contain zeros I will put them as a fraction it's better why you will see why 2 cross 1 2 3 from numerator and 1 2 3 from denominator so I will get the 3 / - 3 / - its 1.5 or one and a half okay now another example 15 or 50 2 oz or horses I work to convert them to Albie here I have two ways to show my answer I can get exact answer or I can say I have something lb and something left over from horses no clear inside each one and we we have 16 ounces or 16 oz I will divide 52 by sixteen I can see how many 16 we have inside - or you can divide 52 divided by 16 it's a 3 3 times 6 48 3 times 1 3 + 4 now so 3 times 1 3 plus 1 is 4 now subtract 2 minus 1 we have to regroup becomes a 12 and this one becomes 4 12 minus 8 is 4 and 4 minus 4 is 0 look here I can see I have a 3 3 lb & 4 oh I can see 3 lb and 4 oz left over or I can keep dividing a decimal point and add 0 to dividend 40/60 is 232 subtract become stands 3 10 minus 2 is 8 2 minus 2 is 0 add another 0 you have to keep adding zeros ok because I don't want to see any remainder so 80 divided by 16 I can hide the 0 and I can write 6 a divided by 1 a 2 is 18 it's greater than 80 when are you 7 it's a greater than 80 so that number is 5 5 times 6 is 30 5 times 1 5 4 3 is 8 so I have exactly three point 25 only 3.25 lb you can choose any way you want 3 lb and 4 ounces left over or you can say 3.25 and B now let me solve some problems in front of you here can be a measurement of weight of what of weight now I have 32 oz I want to convert them to away from smaller to bigger we have to divide now let me change the cause our questions in knock so 32 divided by 16 it's easy I can get the answer direct its to don't be and 12 tons to only we have to multiply by 2,000 because from bigger to smaller we have to multiply so 12 times 2,000 I have to keep the zeros in the answer here so 2 times it well visit 24 so the answer is 24,000 lb or you can see 10,000 lb to turn from smaller to because we have to divide we have to divide by what by two thousand thirteen thousand divided by two thousand again I told you if I have in dividend and divisor here zeros I can use them as fraction ten thousand over two thousand right you can across one two three one two three so 10 divided by two now it's easier to divide okay when we are crossing the zeros we have to cross the same number of zeros inside numerator and the same number of zeros inside denominator so when I cross the three zeros up I have to cross three zeros there are certain / - it's five tonnes okay now again five thousand only the turn I wanna divide again from smaller to bigger we have to divide so five thousand I can put them as a fraction dyed it over two thousand crossing 3 zeros 5 divided by two is two and a half turns right and five and we chose from bigger to smaller we have to multiply 5 by 16 becomes Atos 24 hours to LV 24 divided by 16 from smaller to become behalf of you boy so 24 divided by 16 in Ukraine here again using fraction if you have a small number you can't simplify it by 2 by 2 becomes 12 over 8 again by 2 by 2 6 over 4 by 2 by 2 becomes a 3 over 2 now 3 over 2 it's 1.5 I'll be okay here again 6 tons to and be from bigger to smaller we have to multiply six by two thousand but the zeroes inside the answer six times to uncross them from here becomes a 12 so 12,000 lb 64 Oz 2 and we I have to divide because of from smaller to because we have to multiply or divide no we have to divide it from smaller to be good we have to divide bigger to smaller multiply so I will divide here 64 divided by 60 again you can put it over 16 over how can put it as a fraction I can divide by 16 1 divided by 16 is 4 so the answer for over 1 it's 4 lv ok I mean in the same 4,000 lb two-tone we have to divide by 2,000 so I will say 4000 divided by 2,000 or 4,000 over 2,000 because division we can convert it as a fraction cross 1 2 3 zeros 1 2 3 zeroes so 4 divided by 2 is 2 top two tones okay now look here I have 1000 lb I would convert it to Tom and I will convert it to us from bigger to smaller multiplied from smaller to bigger divide so I will divide this question to two parts one individual in multiplication so from lb to us I will multiply 1000 MB times 16 take the zeros put them in the answer pilot and cross them from here 16 by 1 is 16 so at 16,000 Oh 1000 Teuton I can see 1,000 divided by 2,000 1,000 divided over mm cross the zeros 1 over 2 it's half done okay look here again that will be to turn arose from lb tours multiply and be two-tone divide because from bigger to small have divided from smaller to bigger we have to divide we have to keep in our mind again smaller to bigger divide began to smaller we have to multiply came to thousand I will divide them into two parts I will solve each question individual so 2000/2001 e number divided by itself it's 1 so it's 1 turn and here 2000 times 16 I will bring the zeros down in the answer from use of 16 times 2 is 32 thousand OS okay now look here again I told you before we can't show our answer in two weeks right I can get the answer or the exact answer or I can show my ants are using what the remainder so the 7000 here and we to turn we have to divide 7,000 over 2000 becomes 7 over 2 7 / - it's a 3.5 tonnes all I can say 7 / 2 3 6 when I multiply here 3 by 2 6 1 I can see 3 turns and 1 and we lift off okay I can't see 3 tonnes and when and we lift over okay and one left over one left over means thousand okay means thousand because here I cost I earn one thousand then we left over okay because here I crossed because each one here one left over on / - 1 / 2 1 / - that means one thousand over two thousand four one thousand and we left over look here 120 goes toward V we have to divide by 60 right 120 divided by 60 I have to check by 5 is 80 by 6 is 96 by 7 all by 8 7 by 6 42 7x1 711 so the group becomes 10 becomes 1 8 0 0 so it lifts over so the answer is 7 MV + 8 or you can keep dividing add 0 here and a decimal point and continue dividing it is right by 16 is 5 8000 when I subtract so I can say I have 7.5 and B or 7 and B and it was left over now to compare again as I told you before I can convert from MV 2 oz multiplying Oz - and we dividing it's up to you so now I will say 48 O's or 3 times 16 to convert it as O's 48 oz is equal to 48 oz after converting okay here turn to lb always we have to multiply because it's better five times 2000 over 4950 10,000 or four thousand nine hundred fifty so ten thousand is greater than four thousand nine hundred fifty lb two O's always I will take multiplying so 2 times 16 or 40 32s less than 40 oz right here we will follow the same procedure I will show you just how to make it here I will divide by two thousand okay or three turn x mm service so 6500 is greater than 6000 4.5 and be on 70 again here I will multiply so 4.5 times 16 or 17 okay I will see 16 4 or 5 5 times 6 35 by 1/5 with the 3 as 8 at 0 because now I will use tens 4 by 6 24 4 by 1 4 1 1 2 6 then add them 0 2 1 7 so here I have only one digit in the decimals so I will put here so 72 so 72 is a greater than 70 right our 5.5 x mm 5.5 x mm or 11,000 so I will across 0 I will across then a similar point I will bring the zeros down to by 55 is 110 so they party okay or you can multiply that this keep the 0 put the zeros down 5.5 x - 2 times 5 is 10 2 times 5 10 11 I have only one digit so becomes here so 11 and I have three zeros so it's very common okay now select the appropriate unit to measure each object use stones pounds or ounces so the first one the weight of tractor who must be interns we cannot say houses or pants we have to say tons okay now question number 25 the weight Oh kitten kitten is very small so we can say all C's or lb means pounds the weight of microscope pounds response is greater than also I will say hours lb means power the way to have sim phone again I can see both okay why would it's better to express the weight of kitchen of a kitchen table is pounds rather than in ounces or tones here you can say oh this is very small we are used to use small objects and some we are using term for large objects like tractor or a truck or a train or car or anything like that small objects like pencil or kitten or puppy or something like that but for a medium objects we will use I can say pants so here explanation the answer will be very that means different from any student to another one or from one to another so here you cannot separate anything you can see how I will use most for small objects done for large objects are from the medium on like tables now top anything like that carpet or anything medium objects I will use parts tables chairs something like that I will use okay don't forget boys it's very important you have to keep in your mind Oh's can be tons like that we have to divide from smaller like that we have to multiply turn to lb we will use two thousand multiply two thousand or divide two thousand also lb 16 divided or multiplied by 16 is that clear it's very important okay bye", "KTiejOelUas": "[Music] you", "vXXyPyKuVYc": "[Music] hey everybody and welcome back to the Big Bang Theory I'm Katie and today we are cooking we are making the best lasagna you have ever tasted in your life it's an old recipe from Italy made by my grandmother and it is tasty and you will not believe it and when I say it's got that pie out it's got all the flavors and richness of a great Italian meal so let's go over our list of ingredients first you need a pound of sweet Italian sausage or medium flavored Italian sausage a pound of lean ground beef one large onion that you got to slice up unfortunately you're gonna have some tears making this dish but you're gonna be crying for happiness not sadness you need some crushed garlic you need some crushed Tomatoes a 28 ounce can of that you need some tomato paste you need some tomato sauce and you need chicken broth along with fresh basil oregano salt black pepper an egg nutmeg mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese and your lasagna noodles oh yeah and let me not forget ricotta cheese we got to have that so let's get started so let's start off by making our sauce in a large pot on medium heat add in your ground sausage and ground beef use a spoon preferably a wooden spoon so you can get that old Italian feel like you're in an old Italian kitchen and use that wooden spoon to break up the meat into small pieces and then once you've browned that meat and you see it start to brown and you can smell it cooking up then you add in your onion and your garlic and once you've added in that you cook the meat until it's really browned you don't want to have undone meat you want to make sure that the meat is done before you start adding it in and getting to the oven phase of the recipe then stir in your fresh basil then add pepper next you'll stir in your chicken broth just 1/2 cup because the juices from the meat and the onions as they cook down will make more water in the dish so you don't want to have too much liquid in the pan and this will ensure that you don't do that and then pour in 28 ounces of crushed tomatoes and then you can add two cans of tomato sauce and one can of tomato paste now once you've stirred in all of your ingredients reduce your heat down to low and simmer for about 30 to 45 minutes now while that's simmering you want to deal with the lasagna noodles one way to speed up the process with your lasagna noodles is to place them in a pot of water so they can start to soften and get prepared to be layered in the dish so what I do is I take the pan that I'm gonna cook the lasagna whether it's a glass pan or whether it's an aluminum pan so you'll place the noodles in the pan with hot water as hot as you can get out of the faucet submerge them into the water and you let them sit let them stay there about 30 minutes and then they'll be ready for you when you start to combine all of your other ingredients to make your lasagna the other thing you need to do is deal with your ricotta cheese mix so to make the ricotta cheese mix that you'll need you get a large mixing bowl and you combine your 30 ounces of ricotta cheese with one egg just one egg not two not three not four one egg then you'll add in salt and a teaspoon of nutmeg [Music] you can sit this aside or you can refrigerate it it doesn't matter because by now your sauce is simmering and you're almost at your 45-minute mark 30 to 45 minute mark of simmering your sauce last thing you need to do before you put your dish together is pre-heat your oven my choice is 375 degrees so now you've got your noodles you've got your ricotta cheese mix you've got your sauce simmering now it's time to put this dish together to make the best lasagna you've ever tasted and I'm talking about slap your mama not your grandma slap your mama goodness let's start putting all this together to start off spread about a cup of the meat sauce in the bottom of the pan maybe a cup a couple and a half you want to put enough sauce in the bottom of the pan to cover the bottom of the pan it doesn't have to be thick just enough to cover it so that your noodles don't stick to the bottom of the pan because then it gets messy once you put that first layer of sauce into the pan then it's time to add your first layer of noodles so side by side and somewhat on top of one another so you can cover the the lower level of sauce in the pan once you've done your first layer of noodles then you want to add your first layer of ricotta cheese now some people like to measure this out but I'll just I just like to feel it out and cover the noodles as much as I as much as I can on the first layer that bottom layer I think is the most important when you're spreading your ricotta cheese to cover these noodles because that's gonna bake in the most you know the stuff on top you know you when you bite into something it's the bottom that the deepest part of the dish that you get the most flavor from so you really want to make sure that this is your best layer of ricotta cheese and then once you've done that then you top it with mozzarella cheese the sliced cheese that you can get from the deli which is where I get it from you can add those slices on top of that layer of ricotta cheese now after that initial try layer of ingredients you will spawn in another cup to a cup and a half of sauce over the mozzarella and as I said no measuring cups here just sprinkle with Parmesan cheese to your liking I usually like to see things covered in its entirety because I'm imagining those flavors coming through and baking into the dish so I want to make sure that it's covered well you can make your own choices but I like to use a head because that's what Italian cooking is all about it's about flavor it's about richness then you just repeat that process two or three or however mean however many more times based on the size and the depth of your dish and you want to do this so that the last layer you have is mozzarella and parmesan once you've got all your layers in place cover your dish with aluminum foil toss it into the oven and now it's just time to wait I usually bake this dish for about 45 to 50 minutes depending on your oven and you also have to remember that after about 20 to 25 minutes you're going to remove the aluminum foil from the dish and let it bake uncovered for the remaining time that will allow the cheese to be browned on top and give it that classic Brown delicious look and since this is lasagna and it was meant to be served hot when it comes out of the oven you don't have to wait for cooling time you want to serve this hot so pop it on the plate and that completes our meal the best tasting lasagna you've ever had well I hope you liked the recipe this lasagna recipe was passed down now from my family to yours so enjoy it enjoy the family times and all the great family meals you're gonna have by making this dish and I'll see you next time on the big month-long theory [Music] Hawaiian cheeseburgers paya", "aDNi56fJzNA": "what's up y'all welcome to another edition of honest

Juliette Corson preface this book is intended for the use of those housekeepers and cooks who wish to know how to make the most wholesome and palatable dishes at the least possible cost in cookery this fact should be remembered above all others a good cook never waste it is her pride to make the most of everything in the shape of food entrusted to her care and her pleasure to serve it in the most appetizing form in no other way can she prove her excellence for poor cooks are always wasteful and extravagant housekeepers can safely make this book a guide for those of their cooks who are willing to learn new and good methods of cooking familiar foods less should be said that unj\u00fa preference is given to foreign ways of cooking the author begs her readers to remember how much of the success of any dish depends upon its taste if it is well flavored and palliative Li seasoned the eaters of it too not closely criticized its component parts it is just there that the benefit is drived from european culinary skill the judicious use of a few inexpensive sweet herbs and save resources will raise a side dish made from the cheapest cut of meat in gasps Satori excellence for above a badly cooked porterhouse steak or a large but poorly flavored roast because the art of utilizing every part of food is eminently French then New York cooking school plan has been to adopt foreign thrift to home kitchen use to provide enough at each meal to cook and serve it so as to invite appetite to make a handsome and agreeable dish out of the materials which the average cook would give away at the door or through among the garbage all our accomplishments that our American wives and daughters will be glad to learn from their European sisters the day has paused for regarding cooking as a menial and vulgar labor and those who give some thought to their daily food usually gain in vigor and cheerfulness it is a tourism that food is concentrated force the manipulation of a mood of power capable of invigorating both body and mind is an occupation worthy to employ intelligence and skill in countries where the people depend upon meager supplies this art is brought to perfection the pot-au-feu of France and Switzerland the OSHA food Reda of Spain the Posche of Poland the Chi of Russia the macaroni of Italy the crowd's II of Scotland are practical examples of this fact in no country in the world is there such an abundance of food as in America all the needful ingredients for making these national dishes or their equivalents can be found in the markets of our cities and most of them are the products of this country this being true there is no reason why American cookery should be so comparatively limited why the question of what shall we have for dinner today should be the despair of the inexperienced housekeeper if in no other land is there such profusion of food certainly and none is so much wasted from sheer ignorance and spoiled by bad cooking in Europe provinces would live upon what towns waste here the very herbes of the in the hands of a skilful cook can be transformed into palatable and nutritious vines the plainest and cheapest materials can be prepared for the table in an appetizing and satisfactory form let our readers test this fact by cooking according to the receipt any dish named in the chapter upon cheap dishes without meat and the author will stake her Cluny reputation that the food so prepared will be both palatable and nourishing many persons required the practice of serving several dishes at a meal as troublesome and expensive the first objection may hold good for the best results in any direction are never gained without trouble the second is wholly untain able soup fish vegetables and bread are all less costly than heavy joints of meat if hunger can be partly satisfied on them and it is true that a thick slice of bread and a bowl of soup will contend the hungry stomach less meat will be required and consequently less expense incurred this is an excellent reason why the housewife should not spend the bulk of her market money on a large roast of beef or a leg of mutton but should rather divide the amount among the different dishes of soup fish and ragout or stew of some cheap cuts of meat and a few vegetables and now and then indulge in a plain pudding or a little fruit for dessert was judicious marketing and proper cooking the food of our world to do clauses might be made for better than two-thirds of that now served on the tables of the wealthy and the poor might learn that there's craig and ovum Autzen would furnish them was at least three dishes two forward in some measure this result the present collection of cooking school receipts is offered to the public worst assurance that everyone given has been tested by the author and is complete in every detail as economical as care and use can make it and plain enough for ordinary households the quantities mentioned in the various receipts are calculated to serve for a family of eight persons when two or more dishes constitute a dinner was the addition of soup of course when only one dish is to form the meal was bread and vegetables a larger quantity must be allowed communications from all parts of the country state that the principles of kitchen economy as taught in the New York cooking school and widely disseminated by the press have been put into practice in many families to the great improvement of health and temper for an early fat man can either be strong nor cheerful the hours spent at table should be full of harmony and content or the meal will fail to meet the requirements of the body the question of the hour is how well can we live if we are moderately poor the author of the cooking school manual is doing her best to answer it satisfactorily she has worked earnestly in a comparatively new field of labor and she prays that strong hands may unite in the effort to show how excellent a thing it is to make the best and most of the bound full supply our country's teeming bosom bears at every harvest I'd end of preface section 1 of the cooking manual this is a librivox recording all librivox recordings are in the public domain for more information or to volunteer please visit librivox.org recording by Benny B the cooking manual of practical directions for economical everyday cooking by Juliette Corson general rules for Marketing in order to market intelligently and economically we must bear in mind the three great divisions of foods generally accepted in their consideration and endeavor to adapt them to the requirements of our households if we remember that carbonaceous or heat giving foods such as the inner part of the cereals fat meat milk honey liver grapes peas beans potatoes beets carrots and parsnips are the best diet for heart steady workers and for invalids suffering from wasting diseases that nitrogenous or flesh forming foods such as lean meat unbolted flour oatmeal eggs cheese cabbage cauliflower onions spinach asparagus and artichokes are most suitable for those who work rapidly but with intervals of rest and that brain workers should subsist chiefly on light and digestible articles such as fish oysters fruits game and vegetables containing mineral salts in excess we can arrange the daily marketing so as to give a pleasant variety and at the same time satisfy all appetites by only small quantities of perishable things such as green vegetables fruit fish eggs cream and fresh butter by dry groceries and preserved stores in quantities large enough to entitle you to wholesale prices and pay cash in order to avail yourself of the lowest market price make your purchases as early in the day as possible in order to secure a choice of fresh articles and trade with respectable dealers who give full weight and honest measure meats while meats are in season all of the year they are better at stated times for instance pork is prime in late autumn and winter veal should be avoided in summer for sanitary reasons and even our staples beef and mutton vary in quality the flesh of healthy animals is hard and fresh colored the fat next the skin is firm and thick and the suet or kidney fat clear white and abundant if this fat is soft scant and stringy the animal has been poorly fed or overworked beef should be of a bright red color well marbled with yellowish fat and surrounded with a thick outside layer of fat poor beef is dark red and full of gristle and the fat is scant and oily mutton is bright red with plenty of hard white fat poor mutton is dull red in color with dark muddy looking fat veal and pork should be bright flesh color with abundance of hard white semi-transparent fat when the fat is reddish and dark the meat is of an inferior quality the Ale and pork should be eaten very fresh when meat of any kind comes into the house it should be hung up at once in some cool dark place and left until wanted poultry fresh poultry may be known by its full bright eyes pliable feet and soft moist skin the best is plump fat and nearly white and the grain of the flesh is fine the feet and neck of a young fowl are large in proportion to its size and the tip of the breastbone is soft and easily bent between the fingers the body of a cape on is large fat and round the head comparatively small in the comb pale and withered a young has short loose soft Spurs and a long full bright comb old fowls have long thin necks and feet and the flesh on the legs and back has a purplish shade chickens capons and fowls are always in season turkeys when good are white and plump have full breasts and smooth legs generally black with soft loose Spurs and turkeys are smaller fatter and plumper but of inferior flavor full-grown turkeys are the best for boning and boiling as they do not tear in dressing all turkeys have long hairs and the flesh is purplish where it shows under the skin on the legs and back about March they deteriorate in quality turkey poults are tender but lack flavor young ducks and geese are plump with light semi-transparent fat soft breastbone tender flesh leg joints which will break by the weight of the bird fresh colored and brittle beaks and wind pipes that break when pressed but the thumb and forefinger they are best in fall and winter young pigeons have light red flesh upon the breast and full fresh colored legs when the legs are thin and the breast is very dark the birds are old squabs are tender and delicious the giblets a poultry consists of the head neck wings feet gizzard heart and liver and make good soup fricassee spies and various entrees or side dishes game fine game birds are always heavy for their size the flesh of the breasts is firm and plump the skin clear and if a few feathers be plucked from the inside of the lake and around the vent the flesh of freshly killed birds will be fat and fresh colored if it is dark and discolored the game has been hung a long time the wings of good ducks geese pheasants and Woodcock are tender to the touch the tips of the long wing feathers of partridges are pointed in young birds and round in old ones quail snipe and small birds should have full tender breasts young rabbits and hares have short necks thick knees and four paws which can be easily broken old ones are very poor buffalo meat is somewhat similar in appearance to beef say that the flesh is darker and the fat redder it is tender and juicy when it has been kept long enough say about two months in winter the tongue when cured is excellent venison should be tender and very fat or it will be dry and tasteless bear meat when fat and tender is savory and nourishing fish see fish and those which live in both salt and freshwater such as salmon shad and smelts are the finest flavoured the muddy taste of some freshwater species can be overcome by soaking them in cold water and salt for two hours or more before cooking all kinds are best just before spawning the flesh becoming poor and watery after that period fresh fish have firm flesh rigid fins bright clear eyes and ruddy gills oysters clams scallops and mussels should be eaten very fresh as they soon lose their raiveer after being removed from the shell lobsters and crabs should be chosen by their brightness of color lively movement and great weight in proportion to their size vegetables all juicy vegetables should be very fresh and crisp and if a little wilted can be restored by being sprinkled with water and laid in a cool dark place all roots and tubers should be paired and laid in cold water an hour or more before using green vegetables are best just before they flower and roots and tubers are primed from their ripening until spring germination begins fruit all food should be purchased ripe and sound it is poor economy to buy imperfect or decayed kinds as they are neither satisfactory nor healthy eating while the mature full-flavored sorts are invaluable as food sweet herbs sweet and savory herbs are absolutely indispensable to good cooking they give variety and savory flavors to any dish into which they enter and are nearly all of some decided sanitary use the different kinds called for in the various receipts further on in this work can be bought at almost any grocery store or in the market but we advise our readers to obtain seeds from some good florists and make little kitchen gardens of their own even if the space planted be only a box of mold in the kitchen window sage thyme summer savory sweet marjoram tarragon sweet basil rosemary mint Burnett chervil dill and parsley will grow abundantly with very little care and when dried and added judiciously to food greatly improve its flavor parsley tarragon and fennel should be dried in May June and July just before flowering mint in June and July thyme marjoram and savory in July in August basil and sage in August and September all herbs should be gathered in the sunshine and dried by artificial heat their flavor is best preserved by keeping them in airtight tin cans bay leaves can be procured in any drugstore or German grocery at a very moderate expense they have the flavor of Laurel an excellent and convenient spice salt can be made by drying powdering and mixing by repeated siftings the following ingredients one quarter of an ounce each a powder thyme bay leaf and pepper 1/8 of an ounce each of rosemary marjoram and cayenne pepper or powdered capsicum 1/2 of an ounce each of powder clove and nutmeg to every 4 ounces of this powder add one ounce of salt and keep the mixture in an airtight vessel one ounce of it added to 3 pounds of stuffing or forcemeat of any kind makes a delicious seasoning a bouquet of sweet herbs the bouquet or of sweet herbs so often called foreign foreign cooking is made as follows wash three or four sprigs of parsley lay in their midst one sprig of thyme and two bay leaves fold the parsley over the thyme and bay leaves tie it in a cork shaped roll about three inches long and one inch thick the bouquet is used for seasoning soups sauces stews and savory dishes in general and is removed when the dish is served end of section 1 section two of the cooking manual this is a librivox recording all librivox recordings are in the public domain for more information or to volunteer please visit librivox.org recording by Betty bee the cooking manual of practical directions for economical everyday cookery by Julie at person soup soup is the most satisfactory and nourishing of all dishes when it is properly made its value depends upon what is put into it but even in its most economical form it constitutes a hearty meal when eaten with bread and vegetables it can be made from the merest scraps and trimmings of meat from the heads tails and feet of animals from the bones and skin of fish and from cereals and vegetables alone pot liquor in which meat has been boiled should always be saved and used for soup the next day when by the removal of all fat by careful skimming and the addition of a few vegetables or some dumplings rice or macaroni it will make a palatable broth experiments made by French chemists proof that the delicacy and richness of soup may be increased by first soaking the meat in tepid water enough to cover it and adding this to the second water in which the meat is put over the fire just as it reaches the boiling point one general stock part one where there is a family of any size it is well to keep a clean pot or saucepan on the back of the stove to receive all of the clean scraps of meat bones and remains of poultry and Game which are found in every kitchen but vegetables should not be put into it as they are apt to sour the proper proportions for soup are one pound of meat and bone to one and a half quarts of cold water the meat and bones to be well chopped and broken up and put over the fire in cold water being brought slowly to a boil and carefully skimmed as often as any scum rises and being maintained at a steady boiling point from two to six hours as time miss one hour before the stock is done add to it one carrot and one turnip parent one onion stuck with three cloves and a bouquet of sweet herbs part two when the soup is to be boiled 6 hours 2 quarts of cold water must be allowed to every pound of meat this will be reduced to 1 quart in boiling 2 gills of soup are usually allowed for each person at table when it is served as the first part of the dinner and meats are to follow it care should be taken that the stock pot boils slowly and constantly from one side as rapid and irregular boiling clouds and darkens the stock as much as imperfect skimming stock should never be allowed to cool in the stock pot which should be strained into an earthen jar and left standing to cool uncovered and all the fat removed and saved to clarify for drippings the stock is then ready to heat and use for soup or gravy when stock has been darkened and clouded by careless skimming and fast boiling it can be clarified by adding to it one egg and the shell mix first with a Gill of cold water then with a Gill of boiling soup and stirring it briskly into the soup until it boils then remove it to the back of the fire where it will not boil and let it stand until the white and shell of the egg have collected the small particles clouding the soup then strain it once or twice until it looks clear to flavoring thickening and coloring soups the flavor of soup stock may be varied by using in it a little ham anchovy sausage sugar or calf's foot herbs in the sprig and whole spices should be used in seasoning as they can easily be strained out all delicate flavors and wine should be added to soup just before serving it unless the contrary is expressly directed in the receipt because boiling would almost entirely evaporate them one Gill of wine is usually allowed to every three pints of soup soups which precede a full dinner should be less rich than those which form the ball of the meal-cornstarch arrowroot and potato flour are better than wheat flour for thickening soup the meal of peas and beans can be held in suspension by mixing together dry a tablespoonful of butter and flour and stirring it into the soup a quarter of a pint of peas beans or lentils is sufficient to make a quart of thick soup 2 ounces of macaroni vermicelli pearl barley sago tapioca rice or oatmeal are usually allowed for each quart of stock if you wish to darken soup use a teaspoon full of caramel but avoid burn flour carrot and onion as all these give

required at short notice care should be taken to beat the eggs only until they are liked to put the omelet into a well heated and buttered pan and never to turn it in the pan as this flattens and toughen it if the pan be large and only three or four eggs be used in making the omelettes the pan should be tipped and held by the handle so that the eggs will cook in a small space upon one side of it instead of spreading all over it and becoming too dry in the process of cooking there are three secrets in the making of a good omelette namely the separate beating of the eggs the knack of stirring it upon the fire and the method of transferring it from the fire to the table if you will carefully follow the directions here given you can produce a dish dainty enough to satisfy the most fastidious eater 74 plain omelet if you have to serve 8 persons make 3 omelettes as follows put 1/2 an ounce about a tablespoon full of butter into a clean smooth frying pan and set it upon the back of the stove to melt stir the yolks of three eggs with a salt spoonful of salt for one minute beat the whites of three eggs to a stiff froth with an egg whip beginning slowly and gradually increasing the speed until the froth will not leave the dish if it be turned bottom up this will take from three to five minutes according to the freshness of the eggs now pour the yolks into the froth and mix them gently with a silver spoon turning the bowl of the spoon over and over but do not stir in a circle or rapidly put the frying pan containing the melted butter over the fire pour in the omelette and stir it with the law two pronged fork a carving fork will do carefully raising the edges with the fork as fast as they cook and turning them toward the center until the omelet lies in the middle of the pan in a light mess cooked soft or hard to suit the taste when done to the desired degree turn it out upon a hot dish without touching it with either fork or spoon and send it to the table immediately another excellent method is to beat three eggs without separating the whites and yolks with one tablespoon full of milk and a little salt and pepper and put them into a frying pan containing two ounces of butter brown but the omelet stand for a moment and then turn the edges up gently with a fork and shake the pan to prevent it burning or sticking at the bottom five minutes will fry it a delicate brown and it should then be doubled and sent to the table at once on a hot dish three eggs will make an omelet large enough for two persons if any other dish is to be served

little salt break into it as many eggs as will lay upon it without crowding and brown them underneath then set them where the heat of the fire will strike their tops and let them color a pale yellow

cents per pound for prime quality this cheese's of a greenish color a little salt and taste and flavored with delicate herbs the nearest domestic variety is sage cheese which may be used when Parmesan cannot be obtained if in heating Parmesan cheese it appears oily it is from the lack of moisture and this can be supplied by adding a few tablespoon falsi broth and stirring it over the fire for a minute when more macaroni has been boiled than is used it can be kept perfectly good by laying it in fresh water which must be changed everyday there are several forms of Italian pastes but the composition is almost identical all being made from the interior part of the finest wheat grown on the Mediterranean shores the largest tubes about the size of a lead pencil are called macaroni the second variety as large as a common pipestem is termed Mazzini and the smallest is spaghetti or threads vermicelli comes to market in the form of small coils or Hanks of fine yellowish threads an Italian paste appears in small letters and various fanciful shapes macaroni is generally known as a rather luxurious dish among the wealthy but it should become one of the chief foods of the people

cooking manual this is a librivox recording all librivox recordings are in the public domain for more information or to volunteer please visit librivox.org the cooking manual of practical directions for economical everyday cookery by Juliette Corson large roasts chapter six large roasts since roasts or rather baked meats so often play the chief part in American dinners a few directions will be useful in connection with their cooking the object in cooking meat is to prepare it for easy mastication and complete digestion and it should be accomplished with the least possible waste of valuable juices of the meat the roasting of meat before the fire is not often possible in ordinary kitchens but with a well-managed oven the same result can be attained if meat is placed before slow fire or in a cool oven the little heat that reaches it serves only to draw out its juices and with them its nutritious elements the albumen of its cut surfaces coagulates are the temperatures of a bright clear fire or a hot oven and thus seals up the juices so that only part of them escape and those are collected in the form of rich Brown highly flavoured crust upon the surface of well roasted meat a good temperature for baking meat is from 320 degrees to 400 degrees Fahrenheit if the meat is put into a very hot oven for a very few moments to harden the outside the heat can subsequently be moderated and the cooking finished more slowly so that the meat will be sufficiently well-done but not burned meat should be roasted about 20 minutes to a pound to be moderately well done the fire should be clear and steady in order that an equal Heat may reach the joint and keep its interior steam at the proper degree of heat after the right length of time has elapsed care being taken meantime that the meat does not burn it may be tested by pressing it with finger if it is rare it will spring back when the pressure is removed if it is moderately done the resistance to pressure will be very slight and if it is thoroughly cooked it will remain heavy under the fingers never test it by cutting into it with a knife or puncturing it with a fork for in this way you waste the rich juices if you wish to froth the roast meat dredge a little flour over its surface and brown it a few moments before serving it if it is to be glazed brush it with a clear stock concentrated to a paste by rapid boiling or dust a little powdered sugar over it in both cases return it to the oven to set the glaze 90 roast beef with Yorkshire pudding have 3 ribs of prime beef prepared by the butcher for roasting all the bones being taken out of it is desirable to carve but clean slice off the top secure it in place with stout twine do not use skewers as the unnecessary holes they make permit the meat juices to escape lay it in the dripping pan on a bed of the following vegetables cut in small pieces 1 small onion half a carrot half a turnip 3 sprigs of parsley 1 sprig of thyme and 3 bay leaves do not put any water in the dripping pan its temperature cannot rise to a degree equal in heat to that of the fat outside of the beef and cannot assist in its cooking but serves only to lower the temperature of the meat where it touches it and consequently to soften the surface and extract the juices do not season it until the surface is partly carbonized by the heat as salt applied to the cut fiber draws out their juices if you use a roasting oven before the fire the meat should be primarily prepared by tying in place and it should be put on the spit carefully sufficient drippings for basting will flow from it and it should be seasoned when half done when entirely done what should be in 15 minutes to each pound of meat the joint should be kept hot until served but should be served as soon as possible to be good when gravies made half a pint of hot water should be added to the dripping pan after the vegetables have been removed and the gravy should be boiled briskly for a few minutes until it is thick enough and seasoned to suit the palate of the family some persons thicken it with a teaspoon full of flour which should be mixed with two tablespoons of cold water before it is stirred into the gravy

served with baked beef or if it is to accompany beef roasted before the fire one hour in the oven and then half an hour under the meat on the spit to catch the gravy which flows from the joint to

is the most economical way of cooking if properly done there are several important points to be considered in this connection we have already said that the best method of cooking meat is that which preserves all its nourishing juices if in addition to this we can prepare it in such a way as to present a large available surface to the action of the digestive juices we will seem to have reached culinary perfection judicious boiling accomplishes this and we cannot do better than to follow leavings plan to first plunge the meat into boiling water and boil it five minutes to coagulate the albumin to a sufficient depth to form a crust upon the surface and thus can find the juices and then add enough cold water to reduce the temperature to 158 degrees Fahrenheit if the meat is to be rare or 165 degrees Fahrenheit if it is to be well-done and to maintain this gentle heat until the meat is tender there is comparatively little waste in boiling from the fact that the fat melts less quickly than boiling or roasting and the covering of the pot retards evaporation while the water absorbed by the meat adds to its bulk to a certain extent without detracting from its quality a strainer or plate should be placed in the bottom of the pot to prevent burning the pot should be skimmed clear as soon as it boils and the subsequent simmering should be gentle and steady there should always be sufficient water to cover the meat in order to keep it plump less body of heat is required to boil in copper or iron pots than in those made of tin especially if the ladder had been polished surfaces which throw off the heat the pot liquor from the boiled meat should always be strained into an earthen jar and left to cool the fat can then be taken off for kitchen use and the liquor utilized as the basis for some kind of soup one hundred twelve leg of mutton with caper sauce put a leg of mutton weighing about six pounds on the fire in enough boiling water to cover it boil it for five minutes skimming it as often as any scum rises then pour in enough cold water to reduce the heat to about 160 degrees Fahrenheit season with the tablespoon full of salt and simmer the meat at the heat until it is tender allowing about 20 minutes cooking to each pound of meat if turnips are to be served with it as garnish choose them of equal size pair them smoothly and boil them with the

of bread is one of the most important of all culinary operations and to many persons one of the most difficult it is impossible to set exact rules as to the quantity of flour or liquid to be used for the quality of the flour varies as much as that of the grain from which it is made and some varieties excessive in gluten will absorb nearly 1/3 more liquid than others and produce correspondingly more bread for this reason in buying flour we must choose that which contains the most gluten this kind will remain in a firm compact mess when pressed in the hand and will retain all the lines and marks of the skin or if mixed with water it will take up a great deal in proportion to its bulk and will form a tough elastic dough gluten in flour corresponds with the nitrates or flesh formers in flesh and abounds in hard winter wheat the flour containing much of it is never extremely white the object of making bread that is of mixing water with the flour and subsequently exposing the dough to intense heat is to expand and rupture the cells of the green so as to expose the greatest possible surface to the action of the digestive fluids this is accomplished in several ways by the formation of air cells through the medium of a satis fermentation as in yeast bread by the mechanical introduction of carbonic acid gas as in aerated bread by the mixture with the flour of a gas generating compound which needs only the contact of moisture to put it in active operation and by the beating into the dough of atmospheric air no organic change in the elements of the flour is necessary like that produced by the partial decomposition of some of its properties in bread raised with yeast so long as proper surface is obtained for the action of the gastric juices the purpose of raising is accomplished bread raised without fermentation can be made from the following receipt and there is no question of its healthfulness 254 aerated homemade bread mix flour and water together to the consistency of a thick batter then beat it until fine bubbles of air thoroughly permeated for small biscuit pour it into patty pans and bake in a good brisk oven for bread and loaves more flour is thoroughly needed in with the hands until the dough is full of air bubbles and then baked at once without being allowed to stand when bread is to be raised by the assadist fermentation of yeast the sponge should be maintained at a temperature of 89 degrees Fahrenheit until it is sufficiently light and the baking should be accomplished at a heat of over 320 degrees when yeast is too bitter from the excess of hops mix plenty of water with it and let it stand for some hours then throw the water off and use the settlings when used to soured it may be restored by adding to it a little carbonate of soda or ammonia window has soured the acidity can be corrected by the use of a little carbonate of soda or ammonia if the sponge of raised bread be allowed to overwork itself it will seller from excessive fermentation and if the temperature be permitted to fall and the dough too cool it will be heavy thorough kneading renders yeast red white and fine but is unnecessary in bread made with baking powder great care should be taken in the preparation of yeast for leavened bread as the chemical decomposition inseparable from its use is largely increased by any impurity or undue fermentation experience and judgment are necessary to the uniform production of good bread and those are gained only by repeated trials we subdue the best receipts which we have been able to procure for making yeast 255 homebrew yeast boil 2 ounces of the best hops and 4 quarts of water for half an hour strain off the liquor and let it cool till lukewarm and then at half a pound of brown sugar and 2 heaping tablespoon Falls of salt use a little of this liqueur to beat up one pound of the best flour and gradually mix in all of it with the flour let it stand for days to ferment in a warm place near the fire stirring it frequently on the third day boil and mash 3 pounds of potatoes and stir them into it on the fourth day strain and bottle it it will keep good for months 256 homemade bread put 7 pounds of flour into a deep pan and make a hollow in the center into this put 1 quart of lukewarm water 1 tablespoon full of salt 1 teaspoon full of sugar and half a gill of yeast have ready 3 pints more of warm water and use as much of it as is necessary to make a rather soft dough mixing and kneading it well with both hands when it is smooth and shining through a little flour upon it lay a large towel over it fold it and set it in a warm place by the fire for four or five hours to rise then knead it again for 15 minutes cover it with the towel and set it to rise once more then divide it into 2 or 4 loaves and bake it in a quick oven this quantity of material will make 8 pounds of bread and will require 1 hours baking - 2 pounds of dough in cold weather the dough should be mixed in a warm room and not allowed to cool while if it does not rise well set the pan containing it over a large vessel of boiling water it is best to mix the bread at night and let it rise till morning in a warm and even temperature 257 milk bread take 1 quart of milk heat one third of it and scald with it half a pint of flour if the milk is skimmed use a small piece of butter when the batter is school had the rest of the milk 1 cup of hot beast half a tablespoon full of salt and flour enough to make it quite stiff knead the dough until it is fine and smooth and raise it overnight this quantity makes three small loaves 258th rice bread simmer one pound of rice and three quarts of water until the rice is soft and the water evaporated or absorbed let it cool until it is only lukewarm mix into it nearly 4 pounds of flour 2 teaspoon fulls of salt and four tablespoonfuls of yeast needed until it is smooth and shining let it rise once before the fire make it up into loaves with the little flour reserved from the four pounds and bake it thoroughly 259 potato bread take good mealy boiled potatoes in the proportion of one third of the quantity of flour you propose to use pass them to a coarse sieve into the flour using a wooden spoon and adding enough cold water to enable you to pass them through readily use the proper quantity of yeast salt and water and make up the bread in the usual way a saving of at least 20% is thus gained 260 pulled bread take from the oven an ordinary loaf of bread when it is about half baked and with the fingers while it is yet hot pull it apart in egg size pieces of a regular shape throw them upon tins and bake them in a slow oven to a rich brown color this bread is excellent to eat with cheese or wine wear bread is made with baking powder the following rule should be closely observed if any shortening be used it should be rubbed into the flour before it is wet cold water or sweet milk should always be used to wet it and the dough should be needed immediately and only long enough to thoroughly mix it and form it into the desired shape it should then be placed in a well heated oven and baked quickly otherwise the carbonic acid gas will escape before the expanded cells are fixed in the bread and thus the lightness of the loaf will be impaired as a very large margin of profit is indulged in by the manufacturers of baking powders we subdue naked formula for making the article at home and a considerable saving 261 baking powder mix thoroughly by powdering and sifting together several times the following ingredients 4 ounces of protech acid and 6 ounces each of bicarbonate of soda and starch keep the mixture in an airtight can the following receipts will be found useful and easy 262 loaf bread sift together 2 or 3 times 1 pound of flour 3 teaspoon fulls of baking powder 1 salt spoonful of salt and 1 teaspoon full of fine sugar mixed with enough cold sweet milk to make the dough of the consistency of biscuit or if you have no milk use cold water work the dough only long enough to incorporate the flour well with the milk or water put it into a baking pan buttered and slightly warmed and set it immediately into a hot oven after about 5 minutes cover it with paper so that the crust may not form so quickly as to prevent rising bake about 3/4 of an hour this bread is sweet and wholesome and may be eaten by some persons whose digestion is imperfect with greater safety than yeast fermented bread 263 breakfast rolls mix well by sifting 1 pound of flour 3 teaspoon fulls of baking powder half a teaspoon full of salt and 1 heaping teaspoon full of pulverized or fine sugar into a small portion of the above rub two ounces of lard fine and smooth mix with the rest of the flour and quickly wet it up with enough cold milk to enable you to roll it out about half an inch thick cut out the dough with a tin shape or the sharp knife in the form of diamonds lightly wet the top with water and double them path over with them upon a chin buttered and warm and bake them in a hot oven 260 for tea biscuit mix s above using the same proportions and cutting out with a round biscuit cutter when they are baked wash them over with cold milk and return them to the oven for a moment to dry 265 finger biscuit mix says above cut out with the sharp knife in strips 3 inches long 1 inch wide and one quarter of an inch thick lay them upon a butter tin so that they will not touch brush them over with an egg beaten up with one tablespoon full of milk and bake them in a hot oven 266 cream breakfast rolls Mick says above substituting cream for the milk in moistening the dough cut them out with an oval cutter 2 inches long and one and a half inches wide brush the tops with cream and pull them slightly lengthwise then fold them together leaving a slight projection of the underside put them on a butter chin brush the tops with cream and bake them in a hot oven 267 breakfast twist mix us for breakfast rolls cut in strips 3 inches long and half an inch thick roll each one out thin at the ends but leave the center of the original thickness place three strips side-by-side braid them together and pinch the ends to hold them when the twists are all made out lay them upon a butter tin brush them over with milk and bake them in a hot oven a little fine sugar dusted over the tops glazes them and improves their flavor hot rolls and biscuits should be served well covered with the napkin 268 how to freshen stale bread a loaf of stale bread placed in a close to end vessel and steamed for half an hour will be completely freshened 269 toasts but few persons know how to prepare toast properly it should be made with the aim of evaporating from the bread all the superfluous water and transforming it's tough and moist substance into digestible food for this reason the slices should be exposed gradually to heat of a gentle fire first upon one side and then upon the other for one minute and after that they may be toasted golden-brown at this stage it has become pure wheat Farina and is not liable to produce acid as fermentation in the stomach besides it will now absorb the butter thoroughly and both substances will be in condition to be freely subjected to the action of gastric juice and consequently will be digested with ease dry toast should be sent to the table the instant it is made buttered toast should be set into the oven for about five minutes to render a crisp end of section 15 and of the cooking manual of practical directions for economical everyday cookery by Juliet Corson", "f55tVcVXNjw": "how's it goin riders my name is Patrick from bike berry we're going to go ahead and mix the oil in with our gas today there's just a few things you want to remember first off is when you're mixing and breaking in your engine you want to go two tanks at 16 one ratio with your oil we're going to go ahead and use a synthetic blend we recommend a synthetic blend or better just a full synthetic pay more for your oil now because in the end they'll just make your engine last a whole lot longer we're also going to go ahead and use our Maxima quick to mix bottle today it's going to make our lives a lot easier they have all kinds of different mixture measurements on here I'm gonna go ahead and demonstrate how to mix the oil we're going to go ahead with the 16 one ratio this is one gallon of gas so we're going to go ahead and mix in eight ounces of our of our oil so let's go ahead and do that right now I'm gonna go ahead and open the oil buddy crack the seal we're gonna go ahead use our quick to mix bottle it already has the markings on it right here on the side we have the eight ounce mark go ahead and pour that in here I'm gonna line that up with the eight ounce bar so we're at eight ounces here I'd recommend a funnel if you can makes it much much easier to mix the oil and with your gas here this is gonna be a little tricky because I forgot my funnel so we're gonna go ahead and try to baby this in here then we have it that's the next year oil is now mixed with the gasoline mix it up as well we got about that mixes as well as possible when you're in the breaking-in period make sure that you do not go over 20 miles an hour so you want to vary the RPMs make sure that the engine kind of just breaks in softly you don't want to push it too hard that's just once again gonna just make that engine will last a whole lot longer you don't want to run it for too long we recommend them less than a half hour 20 minutes a very short period of time just run it for the first two tanks make sure that when you run it it's nice and cool when you start it up the next time we're just going to break that engine in and is going to run really well if you have any other questions or comments or any other ideas that you might have for videos with us here at bike Barre just go ahead and comment below let us know if anything we can go ahead and help you guys out with my name is Patrick with white Barry and thank you for watching the video", "iwHiK23mag0": "okay and listen seven we're gonna be for the first time trying to show them how to multiply fractions by whole numbers using tape diagrams and we're actually going to be using more division at this point because that's something they're familiar with to show them and we're gonna be using the word up so we'll say find one-third of another number and the role for this lesson is try to get them to associate of with multiply they're actually multi-action by a whole number number one it says one-fourth of 24 and what they've done is they drew a tape diagram and the total was 24 on top and a sentence says 1/4 of they split it into fourths and they're looking for this one piece and what they did is they say okay well then what I can do is I can do 24 there's 4 units equals 24 so 24 divided by 4 equals 6 so this 1/4 would be 6 so 1/4 of 24 equals 6 now under B we're looking for one for 248 saying thing we draw tape diagram the total being 48 cents as quarters we're gonna split it into fourths and we're looking for 1/4 of it so since we're looking for 1/4 of it we would take 48 divided by 4 which equals 48 force which equals 12 so each one would equal 12 so 1/4 of 48 would be 12 on C's the first time we're looking for something more than just 1 a unit of one what we're gonna do the problem exactly the same way a tape diagram we're gonna put our total up top if you notice they put a multiplication sign here this time so instead of 1/4 of 24 we're saying 2/3 times 18 but that's the same thing quarter of in 2/3 times 18 are the same result now this one where it says thirds so we're gonna split it into thirds what we're looking for what two-thirds is but in order to find two-thirds we're still gonna take 18 divided by 3 which equals 18 thirds now 18 thirds equals 6 so if one unit equals 6 the second unit would equal 6 and this was 6 2/3 of them would be 12 so 2/3 of 18 would be 12 our last one says 2 6 of 18 2 X 2 6 times 18 and draw our tape diagram once again our whole number going on top which is 18 says we're split into 6 so I'm gonna split it into thirds and I'll split the thirds into 6 and it says we're looking for 2 6 it should be here but in order to solve what we're gonna go with 18 divided by 6 which equals 18 6 which we know equals 3 so since each one equals 3 we know 2 to 6 of 18 would equal 6 all right now we have three sevens times 49 so our total is 49 said seven so we're gonna split them into 7 one two three four five six not to put another one on there seven and we're looking for three sevens but we're still gonna solve for a unit of one in order to solve it so we're gonna go 49 divided by 7 because there's seven units which equals 49 7 which equals 7 so we know that each one would be 7 but since we're looking for three 7s we know 3 times 7 equals 21 so 3 7 2 49 would equal 21 now our numbers are getting a lot larger over here now we know our total is 1 20 says tenths so we're gonna spit in a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ok and we're looking for 3 tenths so we know that we have 120 divided by 10 which equals 120 over 10 using what we know about multiplying and dividing we can take out the common factors of 10 and we know that equals 12 so now we know each one is equal to 12 so now we've got 12 times 3 which equals 36 so three tenths of 120 would be 36 on G so again putting your top of 31 we're splitting it into thirds this time we are looking for 1/3 so we know we have 31 divided by three which equals 31 thirds which equals ten and one-third and I know that because 3 goes into 31 10 times was 31 left over 1/3 so we know each one of these is gonna be 10 and 1/3 so we know that one-third of 31 would equal 10 and 1/3 our last problem our total is 20 we're splitting this into fists we're looking for 2/5 we're still solving for this unit of 1 so we know we have 20 divided by 5 which equals twenty fifths which equals 4 so we know we have 4 and H and we're looking for 2/5 so we know 4 times 2 equals 8 so 2/5 of 20 would equal 8 on eye the total is 25 and we're splitting it into fourths and we're looking for 1/4 notice I always draw what I'm looking for so I can keep track and make sure I would give the right answer so we know we have 25 divided by 4 to find that unit and you know that's equal to 25 fourths which we know that would go in there six times because 6 times 4 would be 24 use 1 left over so it'll be 1/4 so it equals 6 and 1/4 on our next one total once again is 25 and we're splitting it up into quarters again but this time we're looking for 3 quarters once again we're still going to go 25 divided by 4 which equals 25 fourths which equals 10 and a quarter which means that's that 1/4 is 10 and a quarter to me 6 and 1/4 thinking of a problem ahead of time so since we know that's 6 and a quarter now we have 6 and 1/4 times 3 which I can go 3 times 6 is 18 and then I have 3 times 1/4 which is 1 times 3 over 4 which equals 3/4 so it's going to be 18 and 3/4 kay says 33 fourth of a number is 27 what is the number okay they're just kind of put it in in dial word problem we know we're still looking for part of a hole the hole is 27 we're gonna split it into force and we're looking for three four seven so we know 27 divided by four equals 27 fourths 27 force equals well I know 4 times 6 is 24 4 times 7 is 28 says too much so I has to be 6 and with 3 left over here my denominator so each one's gonna be equal to 6 and 3/4 now if I just add these up I got 6 12 18 from a whole numbers and now I'm gonna add my quarters three six nine quarters which I know that would equal to 18 and four we're going to nine two times with one left over so would equal 20 in one quarter the last one over here we know we're looking for two-fifths of 14 little for two-fifths now we got 14 we're dividing it into five sections so it ends up being 14 fifths which five and going to 14 2 times 4 left over and 4/5 so we know that's 2 and 4/5 so now we know that two-fifths of 14 we add them together because we've got 2 and 4/5 plus 2 and 4/5 which equals 4 and 8 fifths which equals 5 and 3/5 2 Sall views and taped diagrams a skating rink sold 66 tickets of these two thirds of the children's tickets and the rest were adult tickets what total number of adult tickets were sold now this is where key where a tape diagram comes into play let me draw another way and we know the total here were 66 tickets so when it says two-thirds of them were children's and leaves the remaining being for adults and since this has to be a whole this is two-thirds I know the adults were one-third okay and now the question wants to know what total number of adult tickets are sold here that's what we're looking for so I want to know what one-third of 66 is so 66 divided by three equals 66 thirds I can see three going to three one time 3 goes into 6 is 6 22 times which equals 22 first which equals 22 so one-third would equal 22 and that means two-thirds would have to equal 44 if you added them up you know it with 66 tickets okay a straight angle is split into two smaller angles has shown the smaller angles measures one six two the straight angle what is the angle value of angle a well this is relying that you remember that a straight angle is 180 degrees so when we do our tape diagram our total there's a straight angle which is 180 then we had this thing split into two this one here which is a smaller angle was 1/6 this one here was angle a and just be a whole 1/6 angle a has to be 5 6 now in order to solve this we're gonna take 180 divide it by six cousin six which equals 180 over six and I look for Commons I can see that is that the six will go into six one time six go 180 30 times so this equals 30 so that means that 1/6 the smaller angle a is 30 well we can see little angle to me the angle a is five times that so it's going to be 30 times five which equals 150 so angle a was 150 degrees and you can see we added them up 150 and 30 we get 180 which is our total angle sea animal and Eric made 17 ounces of pizza dough they use 5/8 of the dough to make pizza and use the rest to make calzones was the difference between the amount of dough they use to make pizza and the amount of dough they used to make calzones now this is a tricky word problem so we're gonna make sure that we draw tape diagram form and label everything and we're going to make sure we enter Tate on our drawing exactly what they're looking for so let's start again I'm going to put my tape diagram here and we're gonna go back through we're going to redo it again this and Alaric made 17 ounces of pizza dough so that's our total 17 they used 5/8 of the dough to make pizza so I'm gonna go ahead and put this one here I know this is 5/8 and this was to make pizza and use the rest to make calzone so this was calzone now looking at this this is 5/8 this has to equal one hole so calzones had to be three-eighths now what was the difference between the amount of dough that used to make pizza and the amount of dough that used to make calzones so now I've got to solve for each one of them so we're gonna do this the same way we've been doing it we're gonna take 17 divided by we're gonna split them into eight so we're dividing up by eight to find it you to one XI equals 17 8 which equals 1 because they will go into 17 one time with 9 left over oh that's not right because 9 left over be 9 8 so we obviously this this here could be 2 and 1/8 so we now we know that 1 8 is equal to 2 and 1/8 now now we know the pizza is 5 times that so we got 2 and 1/8 times 5 and what we can do is we can go to 2 and 1/8 plus 2 and 1/8 plus 2 and 1/8 plus 2 and 1/8 plus 2 and 1/8 which we add them up we can go 2 4 6 8 10 and add up our 8 we have 1 2 3 4 5 so this was equal to 10 and 5 8 ounces now the 3/8 that's multiplied by 3 so now we have 2 and 1/8 times 3 which is 2 and 1/8 plus 2 and 1/8 + 2 + 1 8 which equals 6 and 3/8 so we know this is equal to 6 and 3/8 ounce now a question coming back up here they want to know that difference between the amount so even though we've solved it now they want to know the difference in the amount so we've got to take ten in five-eighths and subtract six and three eighths let's see 10 10 minus 6 gives us 4 5 eighths minus 3/8 gives us two eighths so the difference was four and two eighths now even though that is a that is a good answer we see that two eighths can be reduced because I know this is 2 times 1 and this would be 2 times 4 to get 8 take them out and I get 1/4 so this is simplified before and 1/4 D the new york range is hockey team won 3/4 of their games last season if they lost 21 games how many games did they play in the entire season okay so let's go ahead and draw and we're the top of it is total games which we don't know what that is that's what they're asking us to solve then they said they won three quarters and that means that they lost one quarter and it says if they lost 21 games well one quarter tell us what they're equals 21 so in order to solve for three-fourths we know that's gonna be three times 21 T equals 63 now to assign the total games we have 63 plus 21 which is going to give us 84 total games was 84", "0N6SmKVWZdI": "this is Sarah with registered nurse RN comm and in this video we're going to be doing a educational tutorial on how to solve basic conversion problems before you start watching this video though you will want to go to our website registered nurse Orion comm backslash a metric table and print out a printable version of the metric table so you can refer to it and know what's going on with how we're getting the metric table conversions because before you solve a dosage and calculations problems you must know the metric table and how everything converts because we use that as a basic guide in order to solve our problems and also get the worksheets to follow along with this video so if you go to register nurse or and.com backslash worksheets you can get the worksheet for this video it's called basic conversions so you can set there and work the problems as I work them okay so let's get started our first problem is 6 ounces equals how many milliliters okay so we're going to set up a problem like this six ounces equals how many milliliters we know that one ounce equals two tablespoons you know that from the metric table that you've memorized so you're going to say one ounce equals two tablespoons now we have converted that ounces so we're going to mark out ances and we're trying to get two milliliters so now we're going to say 1 tablespoon equals 15 milliliters and I knew that because on the basic metric table and we are told that one tablespoon equals 15 milliliters so we have converted to milliliters so tablespoons is marked out so we are where we wanted to go we wanted to go from a ounces two milliliters what we will do will take everything on the top and multiply it by itself so we will say six times two times 15 equals 180 we will take everything on the bottom which is 1 times 1 that equals 1 and 180 divided by 1 equals 180 so there is 180 milliliters and 6 ounces our next problem is 4 thousand micrograms equals how many milligrams so we are trying to go from micro grams to milligrams we're going to set our problem up like this we say 4 milligrams 4,000 my programs so four thousand micrograms equals how many milligrams so looking at our metric table we know that there is a thousand micrograms in one milligram so thousand micrograms in one milligram we have canceled out micrograms so mark that out and we have went from micro grams to milligrams that's our end so what we're going to do is we're going to multiply everything on the top which four thousand times one is four thousand and nothing on the bottom so it's over a thousand and then you divide four thousand divided by a thousand equals four and that is our answer so there are four milligrams and 4000 micrograms our next problem is 5 grams equals how many micrograms so once again we're going to set our problem up like this just as the problem says we're going to say 5 grams equals how many micrograms so looking at our metric table we know that there is one gram in a thousand milligrams because we are trying to go from grams to micrograms so we've already converted to milligrams and we're going to say to ourself one milligram equals a thousand micrograms and we've already converted with milligrams so we're going to work that out and we have reached our micrograms we will multiply everything at the top five times a thousand times a thousand equals five million and multiply everything on the bottom one times one is one and when you divide five million to one you get five million so the answer is 5 million micrograms moving on to our next problem 50 milliliters equals how many ounces again we'll set our problem up just like how they're asking so we're going to say 50 milliliters equals how many ounces and we are trying to get from milliliters to ounces so in order to do that we must look at our metric table and convert so we know that there are 15 milliliters in 1 tablespoon and to and we've already canceled out milliliters and two tablespoons equals one ounce and we needed to get two ounces so we're done we're going to multiply everything at the top fifty times one times one is 50 and 15 times 2 is 30 so now what we're going to do is divide 50 into 30 when you divide 15 to 30 you get one point six six six six so we'll round up to one point seven so 50 divided by 30 is one point six six and we're going to convert it to one point seven and will not convert it we're just going to round up and it's 1.7 ounce 96 kilograms equals how many pounds so we're going to set up our problem just like how the problem is asking us we're going to say ninety six kilograms equals how many pounds and looking at our metric table we know that there is one kilogram in 2.2 pounds and we've already reached pounds so we're going to cancel out kilograms because we've converted to pounds we're going to multiply everything at the top so 96 times 2.2 gives us two hundred and eleven point two and there's nothing on the bottom except for one so that'll be one and when you divide two hundred eleven point two over one you get two hundred eleven point two so the answer is two hundred and eleven point two pounds okay next problem number six 20 teaspoons equals how many milliliters you will set your problem up just like how the problem is asking 20 teaspoons equals how many milliliters from the metric table we know that there is one teaspoon and five milliliters because we're trying to go from teaspoons to milliliters so one teaspoon equals five milliliters teaspoons cancels out we're going to multiply everything at the top 20 times five is 100 multiply everything on the bottom there's just one thing so one 100 divided by 1 equals 100 so there are a hundred milliliters and 20 teaspoons problem number seven two thousand milliliters equals how many liters we will set our problem up just by how the problem is asking us so two thousand milliliters equals how many liters we know by looking at the metric table that there is a thousand milliliters in 1 liter and we're trying to get two liters so thousand milliliters equals 1 liter milliliters has canceled out because we've converted already and we're done because we're already where we're supposed to be so you'll take everything at the top and multiply it so two thousand times one is two thousand and only thing at the bottom is a thousand then you will divide two thousand divided by a thousand equals two so there are two liters in two thousand Millie okay our very last problem problem 8 it asks how many teaspoons are in five liters so five liters equals how many teaspoons again you're going to set your problem up just like how the problem is asking you're going to put five liters equals how many teaspoons it's going to multiply you're going to say by looking at the metric table you know that there is one liter in a thousand milliliters liters has canceled out so we'll mark it out and we're trying to get two teaspoons so in order to get two teaspoons we're going to have to convert milliliters to tablespoons so from the metric table we know that there's 15 milliliters in 1 tablespoon already converted so now we need to mark out milliliters and we're trying to reach teaspoons so we're going to ask ourselves how many teaspoons are in a tablespoon we know that there is one tablespoon in three teaspoons so one tablespoon equals three teaspoons tablespoons cancels out so we are stopping because we're where we're supposed to be we're supposed to solve for tables teaspoons so what you'll do is multiply everything at the top so five times 1000 times 1 times 3 equals 15,000 multiply everything on the bottom one times 15 times one is 15 and we're going to survive so 15 thousand divided by 15 equals a thousand so there are a thousand teaspoons and five liters so that was a tutorial on how to solve basic

"HvtY4ifl98c": "hey guys it's doc and today the main thing we're gonna do we're gonna go over a lot of stuff today but the main thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go over application rates using these hoes and spray bottles how to mix stuff and how to figure out and how to calculate this stuff in a real easy way to do this it's a hold on one sec hey guys so let me real quick let me tell you what we're gonna do is I'm gonna go to the garage and I'm actually going to show you my sort of super juice mixing station that I made for this year because I'm treating separately several yards but I don't just put down super juice on a spray formula I also do stuff like bug treatments and pre-emergence and all kinds of stuff so I'm gonna show you an easy way to do a calculation on how much am I putting down in my yard and how many spray bottles do I actually need I'm gonna do that we're taking into the garage I'm gonna show you some graphics that I think will make it actually easier for you to understand and a really simple way to figure out how many spray bottles I need for mine and how much do I need to put down and not just again not just the super juice but other products as well first make sure you subscribe because we are doing our giveaway in about two or three weeks to a Youtube subscriber and we're going to do two smaller giveaways what we're on the facebook page so I've made up a little Facebook page for super juice fertilizer so go over there and like that page and we'll do something over there too let's give you a little bit of an update I know for a fact super deuces been produced it's all bagged up it's actually on a truck it's getting ready to go to Amazon so I'm hoping that super juice will be available maybe in about ten days or so on Amazon so look for that and of course you just go to the website how to a doc and just look for the product links and their super juice link over there too so the first thing I want to do is I want to explain give you a sort of a mental picture of these hoes and bottles and how they work so I'm gonna do some graphics here and put up some graphics that make it real simple now this can be applied not just to super juice but anything that you're spraying down then I'll go to the garage and I'll show you my little spray and mixing the station that I made and we'll talk about a few more things so hold on one sec okay guys so let's go ahead and let's walk through this real quick let's say that this is your yard if your yard is defeat by 200 feet you take 50 tons 200 though give you 10,000 square feet of total grass to cover next we know that from my earlier video if you walk at a slow pace and spray one bottle will cover 2,500 square feet of grass so that's the volume of liquid that I need to cover 2500 square feet of grass I need four of these bottles then to cover the 10,000 square feet because 10,000 divided by four is 2500 each bottle is 32 ounces or it's a quart so if I need four bottles that's a gallon of water that I need to apply I always do one extra so I'm gonna do one gallon at 1 quart because again I like to do a slow downward spray and then come up with a high misting spray now let's talk about the amount of material because this is the critical it doesn't matter how much water you have or how much look water you're actually using this is the point that really matters one bag of super juice applied in a 7 1 2 ratio will cover 2 acres or roughly eighty four thousand square feet so I need roughly 1/8 of a bag for 10,000 square feet or roughly 1 cup of material will treat 3000 square feet so if I want to treat this 10,000 square foot area I would put about 3 cups of material if I wanted to do the 7 1 2 ratio now if I want to do a little bit stronger do the 14 to ratio which is what I'll be doing this year especially in the spring one bag of super juice will cover one acre or approximately 42,000 square feet so if I had 10,000 square feet I wanted to do a 14-2 ratio I wouldn't use one quarter of the bag approximately or one cup of material per 1,500 square feet so that means approximately 7 cups of material for the 10,000 square feet so that's how we look at it when we get to the square footage and dividing it out it's a simple method again the water volume doesn't matter you can go back and do a double spray you can do a single spray it's the amount of actual super juice that you put down hey guys so now we're out in the garage and I'm gonna show you my little station I built this year the reason why I built this station the reason why I'm doing this stuff is I've got about what four or five yards and I'm helping people out with so it just makes it easier for me you don't need to get this complicated but I'm going to show you sort of what I do because I don't just use this for super juice I actually use this for other stuff as well too so let me show you first of all let's look at the spray bottles these are the two spray bottles that I always use you can get them on Amazon if you go over to the website there's links to these two spray bottles remember it's not the spray bottles that make the difference it's the sprayer heads these rk1 sprayer heads and the k1 sprayer heads put out a very high psi so there's a lot of pressure so when you spray it have this big long spray with a lot of mist all of the like ortho dial sprays and all those dial sprays you really can't use them and the reason being is this just goes blue just a real weak sort of spray and our goal is because super juice super juice is a foliar spray as well as the roots so the grass can actually start taking up the nutrients within the first four hours it works that fast so we want that foliage coverage and that's what we get I talked about the extra bottle in that in those frames and one of the reasons why I like the extra bottle or I make a couple extra bottles is I'll go through the grass now I did a video earlier and on that earlier video I showed myself measuring doing a fast walk and this will treat 5,000 square feet a slow walk this will treat 2,500 square feet but what I like to do is I like to do a downward spray and spray nice and slow as I walk and then come back with an extra bottle and spray up in the air and get that mist and that mist comes down and falls and falls on the grass and man what a great coverage you get with this and it's not just super juice if you have something else like a weed killer that needs to be on the action foliage of the weeds great way to do this and spray it on and come back with a light mist now am i missed i just missed real quick and just walk over and let it fall obviously windy days it doesn't work well so those are the two bottles and these are the sprayers i had to get that question all the time can i use a dowel spray and can i use a tank sprayer tank sprayers just don't work that well this is the best way to do it first let me show you my crap tables I love these tables I built four of these tables one two three I got four of these tables in my garage and it's helped amazingly look at these things this is a simple 24 inch deep table with legs and it's open here so what I can do is i can store crap on this level and now i can store crap on this level it's given me so much more space in a place to work so I really like these as I call them my crap tables because it gives me two layers of crap so I'm just gonna I'm just gonna start blurting out some tips as I go along on this stuff I purchased something that you probably won't purchase but I'm gonna show it to you anyways this is like an iced tea dispenser and I'll put a link somewhere on the website if you go there has a little spigot on it and so what I do is after I mix everything I pour it into here and then I can take my bottles and I can actually fill my bottles up through the spigot which is really nice you don't have to do that of course but seeing that I'm gonna be doing so many lawns I did that now you know the little stuff you've got a Walmart you buy a couple funnels and the funnels are a dollar apiece I really like these plastic cups measuring cups you know they're 2 bucks at Walmart you can buy the kitchen strainer the real fine crits the kitchen strainer or on an earlier video I showed you these plastic strainers there's like a 400 or 600 micron mesh that I use I've everything you spray whether it's a hose end sprayer or a tank sprayer run it through this and you won't have any clogs because it's super super fine you see that so let me give you an example this method and this understanding this application rate and how we do this is not just for super juice as if I'm having an army worm problem and let's say I'm having an army worm problem and I want to spray some permethrin so I want to spray some permison out of my lawn along with my super juice in the same application I can do that how can I do that using the using the model that I showed before if it's ten thousand square feet I know how many scoops of super juice I need to do I know I'm just saying if this is one ounce per thousand square feet then I need ten I need ten ounces of this in with that concoction that I made as long as it does not matter how much water you use as long as you put all that water out on the same amount of square footage so if I use one gallon two gallons or five gallons it doesn't matter as long as I put that same amount of water down the majority of the time using more water is better just the UH just one of the one other quick tip I always keep here's my lawn dye this is not for coloring your lawn this is to make sure that you have chemicals coming out yes it does give a little bit of a color and unless you see where your spring really important this is the blue this is the green I use the green in the spring in the spring and then I use this in the summertime just better better color balance here is now this picture I got this picture of Walmart someone asked about my pictures just a three dollar picture of Walmart so I'm gonna open up my super juice now I put a piece of duct tape even though even though super juice comes with these like ziplock bag sealers those things very seldom work once you get a lot of material inside of them so I just put a piece of duct tape and close the bag over that way you close it any way you want there's this stuff stores forever so I'm gonna save as an example I'm gonna take one cup of material so here is one cup of the super juice this is what it looks like this is everything inside of it there's nothing else to add and all you're gonna do is for the initial mix I always use hot water because water molecules are moving around really fast just like sugar dissolves faster in hot water just pour it in and it's fine it dissolves very quickly so I'm just gonna pour this in somewhere around here I stole one of my wife spoons and she doesn't know about this so and now I'm just gonna mix this up and you can see that it turns into this kind of brown almost like a thick a thick super-strong black sort of tea mixture is what it is okay really has no odor to it whatsoever does the smell like anything maybe maybe sound smells a little bit like you're boiling seaweed I guess because of the sea kelp inside of it but I'm just gonna mix this up real quick again you don't have to mix it up a whole lot of time I did talk about why you strain it and when you strain it humic has a tendency you may find a few particles of the humic in not many just a few particles that kind of resist melting and I'm going to show you here that in a second so let me just take this I'm just gonna put this strainer on here you can give it one more mix here then I'm going to pour this into my container and you'll notice you'll notice that I have not added the dye yet add your dye last so you're not splattering dye everywhere you're gonna have a couple particles of this humic stuff and all you got to do is if you want to dissolve this even more you can get another little copper cup of hot water put those granules into it and squeeze them what ends up happening with humic is when you do this let me show you it's this real soft feeling material it almost feels like I don't know it's just well I'm almost like baby powder it's real soft but there's not enough in here to really worry about I just throw this away there's plenty of humic inside of it let's go over this math equation again my liquid doesn't matter what matters let's say for example let's say for example I had ten thousand square feet and I want to do a seven one two ratio so three cups this material in here and I've melted it and it's in here does it matter how much water I put in here no as long as I can put one gallon I can put three gallon I can put four gallons it doesn't matter as long as all that liquid goes onto the ten thousand square feet because this is the important part this is the chemical as you call it we'll call it the chemical this is the nutrient that's going on ten thousand square feet the fact that one gallon delivered it two gallons delivered it or three gallons delivered it doesn't matter it does not matter some permethrin if I want to add some permethrin does it really matter how much water whether it's one gallon two gallon or three gallons that I apply this with not really as long as the right on TSA's if I have ten ounces for ten thousand square feet the ounces are right for the amount of square footage the liquid carrier really doesn't matter here's my liquid my liquid pre-emergent okay it's an expensive bottle right here let's say I need I'm just pulling numbers out of the year let's say I need one ounce of mentioned per 1,000 square feet so if I need one ounce I would need ten ounces of this to treat ten thousand square feet they actually say that they want a minimum of one gallon of water per thousand square feet on your application so they actually like a little more water so because this has to be watered into the soil it's actually good when you're putting this down again you don't increase the dosage of the chemical you increase the amount of water and that way you get more of its soak into the soil so manipulation of the water volume really doesn't matter it's the chemical and nutrient that you're putting in that's the important part this is gonna seem kind of stupid but I'm gonna show it to you anyways these little bottles have a little clicking sound when you put them on so here's a little trick I've learned screw the capital on without it being near this handle so screw this on without it being near the handle okay see that so it's away from the handle once you get it on turn this and let it click a lot of times people are trying to undo this while it's clicked on here no get it away from there and now you can get your hand in there you can screw it and unscrew it it took me forever I'm not that bright took me forever to learn how to do that but keep this away from this part while you put it on and then swing this and let it click another tip I show you in a video that we cut these little safety tabs off because they're a pain in the butt going back and forth but if you're taking several these bottles like I use a wheel barrel and I put several these bottles in my wheelbarrow with my hose and I go out and treat the neighbor's lawn or whatever I do keep it in the closed position keep it in the closed position while you're transporting it because if you squeeze this see how there's no air coming out if I open it up that so it'll leak out that's one thing I've learned by mistake I've had these bottles tip over on the ground I look over there's blue coming out of it so keep these in the off position while you're transporting them and storming around you squeeze it nothing open it up it's gonna come out lesson learn this is what the super deuce looks like inside the bag there's the super deuce it does have this little ziplock feature on the bag however I've learned over time that once you start to get grit and so forth inside the Ziploc it doesn't work that well so I just take a piece of little duct tape here and I roll my bag over and I seal it down so I just seal it down with some it's black duct tape duct tape whatever so as an example if I wanted to use a regular pump tank a tank sprayer it's really hard to calculate how much how much chemical you're putting out on your lawn because you really don't know it's just hard to do this is easy once you learn your yard this is what I've learned I know for a fact that eight bottles is what I need when I go out trait so I just mix up don't forget four bottles equals a gallon so if I need eight bottles that's two gallons of liquid so I need to end up with at least two gallons of here to fill these eight bottles that's it I'm done I can put whatever I want chemical wise into it I know that's going out with my lawn so anyways guys hopefully that clears up the spray bottles and should make it pretty easy for you to calculate again just write it down write down your formula it takes me X amount of spray bottles to do my lawn walking at a marginal pace so I'm not running around the yard like crazy take your time and spray it again the more water it's better take your time and go slow I hopefully that's it guys don't forget click that subscribe

[Music]", "3A8hl4Pz2Pc": "hi my name is Nick husband aka from coffee detectives calm and today we're going to address a ticklish question which is how much coffee how many how much coffee grounds should you add twist certain amount of water when you're making coffee in a drip Brewer I'm going to address this because in the question and answer area on the site that is by far the most frequently asked question and when we get into this you'll see why there is it's the coffee maker manufacturers do not make it easy for you to figure that out so here we have a black & decker a mid-range drip coffee maker there's a water reservoir in the back there's a filter basket in the top a carafe deflector a coffee and the heating plate at the bottom to keep it warm so you buy this and I'm not beating up on Black & Decker all the other manufacturers will do the same thing to you so I gave my I take out the little how-to guide and I looked through a figure I want to figure out how much water should I put in here and Hammer how much coffee grinds should I put in here to make a nice cup of coffee well when you read through what it actually says is it says fill up on the back here up to the number of cups you want and there's a little things about four six eight ten twelve same as our same as on the carafe here but when it comes to coffee grinds it says add coffee grinds to taste in other words no use at all so they give you this little scoop here which is a little coffee scoop but again there's nothing on here that tells you what it is or what the capacity is now in fact fortunately I know that that is a standard sized coffee scoop and contains two level teaspoons to them tablespoons of coffee grinds when you fill it to the top level so at least I know that bit now we'll come back to here the for the six the eight to ten how many cups of coffee well is confusing because if I take my kitchen measuring jug I fill it up to two cups and I pour it in there it actually comes up to about 3 and 3/4 cups so these don't correspond to what you might think of as being an actual cup the next question is and let's assume now that somewhere you found maybe on the coffee detective side or from a neighbor or whatever you find out that actually what you should do is have one coffee scoop per cup of coffee so on the face of it looking at this if you're going to make age you'd put 8 of these in but of course you wouldn't because these markings don't actually correspond to what a cup is certainly in the kitchen and what kind of cup do you want do you want a little cup of coffee do you want like a regular mug of coffee or do you want cereal sized mug of coffee because depending on what kind you know what the amount of coffee you're going to make is going to depend on how much water you put in here and how many coffee grinds you add well that's the very greedy that's not enough and I think a lot of us when we get up in the morning like a cup of coffee now the rule of one level coffee scoop of grinds per cup is based on the premise that a cup contains six fluid ounces but it doesn't that's the one that contains six fluid ounces that's about eight fluid ounces and that's a little over ten fluid ounces so things can get complicated because if you just try and follow the manual which is no real help or follow some abstract instruction you can end up with a brewery the cider brewer that's either too weak or too strong so I'll tell you what I do eight fluid ounces not six so instead of doing a level scoop do a heap scoop it gives you just that X bit extra that takes you out from the six to the eighth so if I go make if I gonna drink my coffee in this and I think to myself okay I'm gonna have you know I want to have four cups of coffee over the next two hours which is probably excessive but possible then I want four times eight ounces of water and I want four heaped scoops what I'm suggesting is that you ignore these markings altogether and you can't go by these markings either unless you go on the side here I mean in fact if you're using this that is in fact one cup here is eight fluid ounces so that's actually a pretty good match if that's the case what I'm going to do to fill the water I'm not going to use the carafe and try and use those measuring bars I can either fill this up with water four times and pour it in or I'm going to fill this up to the two cups level and put it in twice so I know that I got enough water for four cups eight fluid ounces each so let's say I'm going to have four cups I put in four times eight fluid ounces into the reservoir then I get my ground coffee we've got what do we got here community coffee ground dark roast very nice coffee and I'm going to use those big scoops so here we are I've got my filter paper in place which I'm going to put in there you're your brewer may have a permanent gold-tone filter and that's fine too and so I just happily put in one two three and in fact doing I doing a heap scoop is much easier I'm quite generous with it because I quite like a dark brew so there we go I put four or four heat coffee scoops in the filter four times that in the water and now I'm ready to go you", "-fwK7Sy8me8": "gavin newsom San Francisco is a mess Phil everywhere piles of human waste throughout the city gavin newsom for governor are you [ __ ] me [Music] hey folks man you see it here with another video hopefully and bring some insight onto the wide world of the shooting sports this time we're testing shotgun holes once again remington a boom sts here we go these are the ones that are really popular with loaders hand loaders trapping skeet shooters and the elk and this time we've got just your regular Wally wheel box 12-gauge two and three quarter one in eight shot one in eighth ounce eight shot these are the world class number one performance as touted by let me pin themselves so last time we test it out good old double a's this time we're gonna try the Remington's interestingly enough this is the ones we were doing last time and you see how the hulls are just smooth on the ones that purportedly are able to be crimped and used a lot very interesting very telling very nice first shot you saw them stick around we're gonna load some up we're gonna shoot as many as we can or until ten until I get tired of it because we got other things to do here you know birth seasons open stick around again we're gonna load - count them - repeatedly until they fail we just get tired of loading our powder of choice this time around as always is our universal clays of which we're dropping 24 grains and we're only doing one ounce of shop we're putting about 40 pounds of wad pressure that's about standard about 35 40 pounds a lot of pressure on these guys first crimp very very nice tight beautiful it's a little bit less than 1/8 so that's why you're seeing that little deep crimp on that one we'll shoot these until like we said one of them gives up the ghost I don't think these will because they have a really good reputation number two number two load number two crimp looks good on this one we got a little bit looks like powder burn but oh well otherwise we're loading good old by the way we're using shed ight primers these are the European primers so they're a little bit big and I use these because Federals accept them and a lot of like the Pheo cheese and the Chennai it's the hulls all those European holes they calm Eurotrash I don't know why they load up fine they like these and they load fine I use a Winchester's and everything else with them never had any issues third shot that look good chasing these holes that's not fun I'll tell you that shot number four still looking good this one this case for some reason has a really distinctive powder burn it burnt built up but the other one looks brand-spanking-new yo yeah fifth reloading primers you able to push him in but takes quite a bit of force remember these are the European primers which are a little bit bigger than the American primers shot number six [Music] shop number seven oh very interesting that this powder burn is getting progressively darker and darker hmm is that indicative of most shells or maybe 50% of the shells I don't know I don't think so though all right so after number seven is the one with all the powder burns let's see how that primer yeah pop it's tight but you can still push it in a little bit yeah same thing with this one [Music] this is number eight our crimps are holding up very nicely I got to say even more nicer more nicer even nicer than the AA's and the universals because back then at this time we had one of each of those that had failed already while crimp kind of got all mashed these are holding up very very nice look at that number nine people number nine number ten and the crimp is still going strong very nice see that very good yeah besides a little bit of swirling that's because we're not doing one and a half ounce shot 11 and the crimps are still holding on very nice well shot number 11 and I'm starting to see just a little bit of fatiguing on the mouth right here just I mean barely showing signs of fatigue and what I mean by that is you see how it kind of its kind of getting kind of wobbly all right we're gonna do one more shot with New England we're gonna call it a day this is number 12 guys primer pockets they're still tight they are still tight very impressive people you can push them in a little bit but I mean you got you got to use a lot of force and I got a lot of my fingers are fat so [Music] well number this is a shot number 12 and if they're holding up very very well there's a lot shot we're gonna do with these this is 12 reloads or hand loads 12 I'm sure the AA's could have done we did 11 with the AA's but after 12 I think you get the point these are high quality we had a Miss feed look at that interesting I don't know what that was all about now the first time we had a Miss feed in this testing well that's it folks number 12 went down the pipe we had a little bit of a miss feed which is very odd I could have been the way I was holding it I don't know after 12 we're starting to get some raggedy looking lips over here see that right there just a little bit but hey after 12 firings a little bit dirty powder burns on the folds areas where it gets the most pressure but besides that Remington STS loads sure very nice I say these are up there with the double A's winchester double A's Remington STS is excellent reload to value component all right very good very very good you're not hesitate to buy these and load them up heck you could probably reload these guys up more but we did 12 loads with these 12 loads unbelievable the very good stuff we're gonna continue our testing you guys have any questions comments concerns send him on down next time you", "-w4mJ4UTkN0": "day seven multiplying and dividing fractions or to start by multiplying fractions and mixed numbers when you're working with mixed numbers you can turn those mixed numbers into improper fractions so that way you can multiply the two fractions when you do so if you can cross simplify I would do that first so that way you do not have to worry about simplifying after you multiply when you multiply fractions you multiply the numbers straight across shootin numerators times your numerators or denominators times denominators and keep it in standard or sorry in simplest form so if we look at some angles that are not done for us for 11 we are multiplying and writing each product in lowest terms so with a we have 2/3 times 5/6 I'm gonna see if I can cross simplify first I see that both of my fractions are not mixed numbers so see if I can month or sari across simplify I can the 2 and the 6 share a common factor of 2 so I'm going to divide both of those by 2 so the 2 would become a 1 and the 6 would become a 3 the 3 and 5 do not share a common factor other than one so I'm just going to multiply straight across here so 1 times 5 is 5 and 3 times 3 is 9 so 5 over 9 is our simplified fraction there for example B we have seven ninths times 3/10 so I'm going to see if I can cross simplify I see that both of these fractions are not mixed numbers so again I'm just going to cross number 5 if I can the 7 and 10 do not share a common factor other than 1 so I moved to the 9 and the 3 they share a common factor of 3 so I'm going to divide both of these by 3 the 3 would become a 1 then 9 becomes a 3 so I now have 7 times 1 which is 7 and 3 times 10 which is 30 so you'll see here that if I cross multiple or sorry cross simplified before I multiply I don't have to simplify when I'm finished as long as I am cross I'm flying as much as I can for C we have 5 eighths times 415 I do not have any McNutt mix numbers so I'm gonna cross simplify if I can the 5 and the 15 share a common factor of 5 so I divide both of them by 5 and the 5 becomes a 1 the 15 becomes 3 eight and four share common factor of 4 8 divided by 4 is 2 and 4 divided by 4 is 1 so I now have 1/2 times 1/3 so I multiply straight across 1 times 1 is 1 2 times 3 is 6 so 1/6 for D we have 3/4 times 7 twelfths again no mixed numbers so I'm going to cross simplify if I can 3 and 12 are both divisible by 3 so the 3 becomes a 1 the 12 becomes 4 4 & 7 are not divisible by anything other than 1 so we can't simplify those so I now have 1/4 times 7/4 so 1 times 7 is 7 and 4 times 4 is 16 so that leaves us with 7 over 16 for our answer for 12 we have a fraction times a whole number remember we take these whole numbers put them over 1 they are the same exact thing so for a we have 2/3 times 16 which is the same thing as 2/3 times 16 over 1 so I multiply the 2 and the 16 and I multiply the 3 and the 1 because I can't simplify anything here so 2 times 16 is 32 and 3 times 1 is 3 from here the only thing we have to do is simplify this fraction and turn it into a mixed number so 3 goes into 32 10 times with 2 left over so we it's 10 and 2/3 for B we have 30 times 11 over 12 so the 30 is 30 over 1 the 30 in the 12 were both divisible by 6 to the 12 becomes a 2 and the 30 becomes 5 so we're doing 5 times 11 which is 55 over 1 times 2 which is 2 2 goes into 55 so many times so 2 goes into 5 twice with 1 left over 2 goes into 15 7 times with one left over so that's 27 and 1/2 first see we have 156 times 3/4 the 156 is going to be put over 1 the 4 goes into 150 six 39 times so we're doing 39 times 3 which is 117 for D we have five six times 2222 so we put that over 1 the 6 goes into 222 37 times so the 6 becomes a 1 the 222 becomes 37 so we're just doing 37 times 5 which gives us 185 for 13 we are going to be multiplying these fractions by mixed numbers so for a I have 2/3 times 5 and 3/4 13 a I have 2/3 times 5 and 3/4 all right so I'm gonna turn this 5 and 3/4 into an improper fraction so I'm gonna keep the 2/3 times 5 times 4 is 20 plus 3 is 23 keep it over the 4 from here I can cross simplify the 2 and the 4 the 2 becomes a 1 the 4 becomes a 2 so I'm doing 1 times 23 which is 23 over 3 times 2 which is 6 6 goes into 23 3 times with 18 so 23 minus 18 gives us 5 let's just left over we keep that over the 6 so it's 3 & 5 6 413 B we have 5 eighths times 7 and three-fifths if 8 times 7 and three-fifths okay so we're gonna turn the seven and three-fifths into an improper fraction 7 times 5 is 35 plus 3 is 38 keep it over the 5 and then keep the 5 over 8 to cross simplify here those 5s both become ones the 8 and the 38 are both divisible by 2 so the 8 can become a for the 38 will become a 16 the one left over 8 9 so sorry this is 19 not 16 all right so from here the one times 19 gives us 19 and the 4 times 1 is 4 so then we simplify these and we are left with 4 and 3/4 4:13 see we're given 2 and 2/3 times 3/8 so 2 and 2/3 times 3/8 all right so the 2 and 2/3 has to become an improper fraction 2 times 3 is 6 plus 2 is 8 keep it over 3 I don't multiply that by 3/8 you'll realize here the eights both become ones so do the threes so just 1 times 1 over 1 times 1 which is 1 for 13 D they give us 2 and 2/7 times 4 and 4 tenths two and 2/7 times 4 and 4 tenths right yes nine tenths 9 tenths ok so we're gonna turn both of these into improper fractions for 2 and 2/7 2 times 7 is 14 plus 2 is 16 keep it over seven for the 4 and nine-tenths 4 times 10 is 40 plus 9 is 49 over 10 the 7 and the 49 can cross simplify it the 7 is gonna become a 1 the 49 becomes 7/16 and 10 can also cross simplify dividing both of those by 2 so 16 will become 8 and 10 becomes 5 so we have 8 times 7 over 1 times 5 the 8 times 7 is 56 the 1 times 5 is 5 5 goes into 56 11 times with 55 so we're gonna have one left over so it's going to be 11 in 1/5 4:14 it tells to complete complete right less than greater than or equal to so a says the product of a whole number greater than one and a proper fraction is always what the whole number so the product of a whole number let's say three and a proper fraction so let's say one half is always what the whole number so if we multiply these that's three and one half or sorry 3 over 2 so 3 halves and that's one in 1/2 so that's less than a whole number for B it's as the product of a whole number greater than one so let's use 3 and a mixed number so let's use one in one half is always what the whole number so this would be 3 over 1 times 1 times 2 is 2 plus 1 is 3 over 2 so this is 9 over 2 which is 4 and 1/2 so this is always going to be greater than for C we have the product of two improper fractions is always what one so to improper fractions let's say 3 over 2 & 5 over 3 so this is going to turn into ones this 5 over 2 so that is 2 and 1/2 so that's always greater than 1 for 15 in tasks us to find each answer do all work in parenthesis first so think order of operations with here so parentheses exponents multiplication then division then adding and subtracting so parentheses first for a we have 2 times 3/8 times 2 ninths so I'm gonna put this down here 15 a 2 times 3/8 times 2 ninths okay so 2 times 3/8 is 2 over 1 the 2 is going to become a 1 the 8 becomes a 4 so it's just 3/4 oops times 2 ninths so the 3 becomes a 1 then 9 becomes a 3 the 4 becomes a 2 the 2 becomes a 1 so 2 times or sorry 1 times 1 is 1 2 times 3 is 6 so that's 1 6 4 15 B we have 8 times 1 and 1/4 minus 3 so 8 times 1 and 1/4 that 8 can become 8 over 1 the 1 and 1/4 is 5 over 4 the 8 and the 4 become 2 and 1 so 2 times 5 is 10 keep it over 1 is just 10 minus 3 is gonna give us 7 4:15 see we have 4/5 times 12 and 1/2 times 6 and 1/4 times 2/5 ok so for this one the 4/5 can stay 4/5 the 12 and 1/2 is going to become 25 over to the 60 the 6 and 1/4 is going to be 25 over 4 and the 2/5 can stay so the 4 is gonna become a to making the 201 5 becomes a one making the 25 or 5 so that's just 2 times 5 which is 10 further 25 over 4 times 2 over 5 the 2 becomes a 1 the 4 becomes a 2 the 5 becomes a 1 the 25 becomes 5 so that's 5 over 2 this 10 is the same thing as 10 over 1 so the 10 becomes a 5 the 2 becomes a 1 5 times 5 is 25 I'm going to actually do 15 D loops up here so we have 3/4 times 2 and 2/5 minus 5/6 times 1 and 11 over 25 all right so the 3/4 times 2 fits the 3/4 can stay 3/4 the 2 and 2/5 however is going to become 2 times 5 which is 10 plus 2 is 12 over 5 for the 5/6 minus 1 and 11 25th the 5/6 will stay the 1 times 25 is 25 plus 11 is 36 over 25 so we're going to simplify first before we multiply with the 3/4 and the 12 v the 12 fits the 4 becomes a 1 the 12 becomes a 3 so that's 9 over 5 with the 5 6 times 36 over 25 the 6 becomes a 1 the 36 becomes 6 the 5 becomes a 1 the 25 becomes 5 so that's 6 over 5 so we now have 9 minus 6 all over 5 so that's 3 over 5 for dividing fractions and mixed numbers remember your fractions have to be improper fractions you cannot have mixed numbers when you're dividing fractions either so turn any mixed number into an improper fraction then keep change flip which means keep the first fraction change the operation to multiplication flip the second fraction or take the reciprocal of the second fraction so if we work on some examples for 11 we are to divide and write each answer in lowest terms so for a we have two ninths divided by one-third so we're going to keep change flip since both of these are improper fractions or since we do not have mixed numbers so the two ninths is going to stay we're going to change the multiplication we're going to flip the second fraction that's going to be three over one we can simplify the 9 and the 3 the 3 the 9 becomes 3 3 becomes 1 so 2 times 1 is 2 and 3 times 1 is 3 so that's 2/3 for B we have 2/5 divided by 1/6 so keep change flip since there's no mixed numbers so 2/5 times 6 over 1 with this we cannot cross simplify there's no factors between 2 and 1 other than 1 that they share there's no factors between 5 and 6 that they share other than 1 so 2 times 6 is 12 5 times 1 is 5 simplify this turn it into a mixed number 5 goes into 12 twice with 2 left over so that's 2 and 2/5 4:11 see we are given 5/8 / 5 7 s so 5/8 / 5/7 okay so we're gonna keep change flip since there's no mixed numbers so we're gonna have 5/8 times 7 over 5 those fives are going to simplify to become ones so we just have 1 times 7 which is 7 and 8 times 1 which is 8 so that's 7/8 and 4 11 D we have 2 / 7 / 5 / 9 so there's no mixed numbers here we're gonna keep change flip so it's 2 over 7 times 9 over 5 you cannot simplify so we are gonna multiply straight across 2 times 9 is 18 the 7 times 5 is 35 we cannot simplify that any further so it's just 18 over 35 for 12 we have for a 10 divided by 5/8 and divided by 5/8 so when I turn this 10 into 10 over 1 I'm also gonna keep change flip so I'm just going to rewrite this as 10 over 1 times 8 over 5 we can simplify the 10 and the 5 the time becomes a 2 5 becomes a 1 so it's just 2 times 8 which is 16 for 12b we have six divided by five six so that's six divided by five six so we're going to keep change flip and turn that 6 into 6 over 1 times 6 over 5 it cannot simplify this is gonna be 35 over 5 I'm sorry 36 over 5 the 5 goes into 30 six seven times with one left over so that's seven in one fifth for 12 see we are given 4 and 4/5 divided by 9 4 and 4/5 divided by 9 ok so we're gonna keep change flip but we're also gonna turn the four fits into an improper fraction remember that 9 is 9 over 1 so 4 times 5 is 20 plus 4 is 20 4 over 5 times take the reciprocal of the 9 over 1 that's 1 over 9 from here we cannot cross simplify so it'll multiply straight across the 24 times 1 is 24 and the 5 times 9 is 45 so 24 over 45 for 12 D we have 1 and 7/8 divided by 4 so again we're gonna turn the 1 and 7/8 into an improper fraction so 1 times 8 is 8 8 plus 7 gives us 15 over 8 we're going to change the multiplication and we take the reciprocal of the 4 over 1 which is 1/4 we cannot simplify so we to multiply straight across 15 times 1 is 15 8 times 4 is 32 so 15 over 32 4:13 for a we have six and seven-eighths divided by two and three fourths so six and seven-eighths divided by two and three fourths so I'm going to start this one by turning these into improper fractions so this is going to be six times eight which is 48 48 plus 7 gives us 55 over eight and then the 2 and three-fourths 2 times 4 is 8 plus 3 is 11 over 4 we're going to keep change flip this is going to be 55 over 8 times 4 over 11 the 55 and the 11 will become 5 and 1 the 8 and the 4 become 2 and 1 so this is just 5 over 2 which is 2 and 1/2 for B we are given 5 and 3/4 divided by 5/8 so turning these into improper fractions the 5 and 3/4 5 times 4 is 20 plus 3 is 23 over 4 the 5 over 8 we don't have to change so we're just going to take the reciprocal of that and multiply these two so we can simplify the 4 becomes a 1 the 8 becomes a 2 so that's 23 times 2 which is 46 over 1 times 5 which is 5 46 or sorry 5 goes into 40 6 9 times with one left over so that's nine one-fifth for C we have three and 1/2 divided by four and one-fifth right d down as well just so that way I don't have to rewrite it 10 divided by 4 and 4/5 okay so with 13 see the 3 and 1/2 is going to turn into 3 times 2 which is 6 plus 1 7 over to the four and 1/5 4 times 5 is 20 plus 1 is 21 over 5 keep change flip so 7 over 2 times 5 over 21 this 7 becomes a 1 the 21 becomes a 3 so 1 times 5 is 5 2 times 3 is 6 it's just 5 6 4 D they give us 7 and there's like 2 and 7 tenths divided by 4 and 4/5 so 2 times 10 is 20 plus 7 is 27 over 10 divided by 4 times 5 is 20 plus 4 is 24 over 5 so keep change flip its 27 over 10 times 5 over 24 we can simplify with the 10 and the 5 the 5 becomes a 1 the time becomes 2 so then we have 27 times 1 which is 27 over 2 times 24 which is 48 you cannot simplify these yes you can the 27 and the 24 can actually turn into 9 and 8 so this would be instead of the 27 over 48 we would have 9 over 16 so again if you can simplify fully before you multiply you wouldn't have to simplify at the end all right so for a review for number one here we have the prime factorization of 135 is well 135 five goes into it evenly five goes into 13 2 times the 30 left over so that's 27 the 27 is 3 and 9 the 9 is 3 and 3 so this would be 3 cubed times 5 4 2 it says which number is not divisible by 6 so for F we have 558 if we divide that by 6 we get 93 for G that's 772 if we divide that by 6 we get 128 point 6 repeating so G is not divisible by 2 for 3 were asked to find the greatest common factor of 50 to 91 and for 143 so factors of these the 52 is 1 in 52 2 and 26 3 does not go into evenly 4 goes into it 13 times five no six no 7 no 8 no 9 no 10 no 11 no 12 no 13 4 times so we're done with that one for the 91 we have 1 in 91 2 does not go into it evenly 3 goes into it with sorry 3 does not go into it evenly 4 does not go into it evenly 5 won't 7 does 13 times and those would be your only factors for 143 we have 1 and 143 the 143 is not divisible by 3 which means it's not divisible by 2 not to physically 3 so it's not divisible by 6 it doesn't end in a 5 or a 0 so 5 is not it's not divisible by 5 it does not 7 doesn't go into it evenly let's try 13 yes 11 times so our greatest common factor here is 13 for f\u00f8rde asks what is the least common multiple of 4 12 and 20 well 4 is 2 times 2 12 is 2 times 6 which is 2 times 3 20 is 2 times 2 that's the 4 time five so one two three we can have the two so these can cross out we have another set of two's so that's another two and then we have a three and a five so this is going to be 4 times 3 which is 12 times 5 which is 64 5 it asks which set of numbers is in order from least to greatest so we can actually take these fractions and turn them into decimals if you want it to if we did that the 5 and 1/3 is 0.55 point three repeating so it's point 3 3 3 3 3 3 forever then we have five and five twelfths so if we did that it would be 4 it would be 5 point 4 1 6 repeating all right so the order these from least to greatest the least of these is the point three repeating so that's 5 and 1/3 then we would have the point 3 5 7 and then the 5 twelfths and the point 5 so C would be our answer for that one 4 6 it asks which number is not equivalent to the others so we have 6 and 16 over 6 which if we simplify that turn into a decimal that's 2 point 6 repeating the rest of them are 2.6 repeating except g47 is which sum is the greatest so for a we have 5 and 2/3 plus 3 and 1/2 plus two and 3/8 we could do this to where we estimate these if we did we might be able to get our answer so this one would be somewhere around 12 this would be a 3 this would be a 9 so that's about 12 the 4 and 8 Elevens would become five the four and five eighths would become five and the four and will become five so that's 15 so I think si would be our answer there and then for D we would have 6 + 6 which is 12 so yes see we can do this by estimating and C would be our answer for 8 it asks when won and forfeits is added to a number the sum is 5 and 3/10 find the number so we're just subtracting these two so we have 5 & 3 tenths minus 1 and 4/5 so in order to subtract these we have to have like denominators so this is going to become 5 & 3 tenths minus 1 & 8 tenths you cannot take 8 from 3 so we're going to change this again to become 4 and 13 over 10 minus 1 & 8 tenths so 13 minus 8 gives us 5 over 10 which is going to be 1/2 and then the 4 minus 1 is 3 so it's 3 and 1/2 so J is your answer for that one mine says a hiking trail is 3 and 3/4 miles long a me hike 2/3 of the way then stopped to rest how much further must she walked to complete the trail so we have to be very careful with this one it tells us that she walked two thirds of the way not 2/3 of a mile two-thirds of a way so we have to take the three and three fourths and actually multiply it by the two thirds to start so we're doing 3 and 3/4 times 2/3 once we do that then we can take that number and subtract it from the three and three fourths so we are going to turn the 3 and 3/4 into an improper fraction 3 times 4 is 12 plus 3 is 15 over 4 times 2 over 3 so the 2 becomes a 1 the 4 becomes a 2 the 15 becomes 5 3 becomes 1 so that's 5 over 2 we are then going to take that and subtract it from 3 and 3/4 of a mile so 3 and 3/4 is the same thing as an improper fraction of 3 times 4 is 12 plus 3 is 15 over 4 minus 5 over 2 you can't do this because your denominators have to be the same so it's going to be 15 over 4 minus 10 over 4 so that's 5 over 4 or 1 and 1/4 so a 4/10 is as a bottle of perfume containing 10 and 1/2 ounces is used to fill 3/4 out sample bottles how many sample bottles can be filled so we are dividing these two so we're going to do 10 and 1/2 divided by 3/4 so we're gonna do 10 and 1/2 which is going to be 21 over 2 times 4 over 3 the 4 becomes 1/2 B or sorry the 4 becomes 2 2 becomes 1 3 becomes 1 27 times 7 or sorry 21 becomes 7 so 7 times 12 oh my gosh 7 times 2 is 14 so it's H for 11 it asks us to find the answer in sub list form so we have to multiply first with these so we are going to simplify the 2 to become a 1 the 4 becomes a 2 so it's going to be 3 and 3/5 which is the same thing as 18 over 5 divided by 3 over 10 we're going to keep change flip so this is going to be 18 over 5 times 10 over 3 the 3 becomes 1 18 becomes 6 5 becomes 1 10 becomes 2 so it's 6 times 2 which is 12 4:12 it says what number multiplied by 1/4 is equal to 3/4 write the answer in simplest form so what number multiplied by 1 and 1/4 so something times 1 and 1/4 is equal to 3 and 1/4 so if we were to divide these two numbers then we could find the answer so we're going to do 3 and 1/4 divided by 1 and 1/4 so turn these into improper fractions and keep change flip so 3 and 1/4 is 13 over 4 divided by 1 and 1/4 is 5 over 4 keep change flip so 13 over 4 times 4 over 5 the force would simplify to become ones and it's just going to be 13 over 5 which is 1 and 3 or sorry 2 and 3/5 2 and 3/5 4:13 we are finding 1/3 divided by 1/3 divided by 1/3 divided by 1/3 divided by 1/3 so I'm going to do this first so 1/3 divided by 1/3 is 1/3 times 3 over 1 so that's 1 divided by 1/3 so I'm going to do this next so 1 times 3 over 1 which is 3 it's going to be 3 or 3 over 1 we then have the divided by 1/3 and the divided by 1/3 left so now I'm going to do this part so keep change flip that's going to be 3 over 1 times 3 over 1 which is 9 then divide that by 1/3 so that's going to be 9 over 1 or 9 times 3 which is 27 for your practice one asks which section or which situation is shown in the figure we're not going to do any of these but you do have 1 2 3 so that's three out of how many that are shaded 9 so that's 1/3 of the total amount which is 9 out of 12 so 1/3 of 3/4 is what we're looking at here again I'm not going to test you on this so you don't need to worry about that question specifically for 2 we're multiplying 5 6 times 3 tenths if I was gonna become a 1/10 becomes a 2 6 becomes a 2 3 becomes a 1 so it's 1 over 4 3 says to find the missing number so with these they would both become ones and the 7 would have to have another 7 in order to become a 1 so that missing number is 7 for 14 or sorry for 4 or multiplying 3 over 8 times 14 that 14 is over 1 the 8 becomes 4 14 becomes 7 so that's 3 times 7 which is 21 over 4 times 1 which is 4 4 goes into 21 5 times with one left over so it's 5 and 1/4 4 5 we have 2/3 times 15 times 1/5 we're doing what's in parentheses first so we can put the 15 over 1 the 3 would become a 1 the 15 becomes a 5 so just 2 times 5 which is 10 times 1/5 or 10 divided by 5 is 2 4 6 it asks which is not equivalent to 3/4 times 1/8 the 3/4 times 1/8 is the same thing as 3 times 2 which is 6 so we would also have the 3 over 2 times 4 to 4 yes this works this works the 16 over 4 though now 3 over 2 times 4 over 1 it would be 12 or 2 not 16 over so H is not equivalent the 3/4 times 8 is the same thing as 3/4 times itself 8 or is plus itself 8 times so J is obviously equivalent first 7 is as only Alisha bought 1 and 3/4 pound of chicken salad at 6 dollars and 80 cents per pound how much did she spend so we're multiplying these two the 6 and 8 over 10 is what you're working with for that so this is the same thing as 6 and 8 tenths which is 6 and 4/5 so we're multiplying 1 and 3/4 times 6 and 4 tenths so turn them into improper fractions 1 times 4 plus 3 is 7 over 4 6 times 4 oh sorry 6 times 10 plus 4 is 64 over 10 so we are going to simplify this the 4 and the 64 become 1 and 16 so it's going to be 7 times 16 over 10 the 7 times 16 gives us 112 over 10 10 goes into 112 11 times with 110 so that's 2 with time left over so that's 11.20 so $11.20 for 8 it's as a bag of peanuts weighs 1 and 7/8 pounds how much do one and third bags of peanuts away so we're multiplying these so 1 and 7/8 times 1 and 1/3 so we're gonna turn them into improper fractions 1 times 8 plus 7 gives us 15 over 8 and 1 times 3 plus 1 is 4 over 3 the 4 becomes 1 8 becomes 2 3 becomes 1 15 becomes 5 so that's 5 over 2 which is 2 and 1/2 4 9 it says which expression can be used to find 2 and 5/6 of 30 of means multiplication so we have 2 times 30 and 5 6 times 30 yes but we'd have to add them so 2 times 35 6-30 d would be our answer just distributing here for 10 is as a taylor used 3 and 7/8 yards of wool that costs 12 dollars a yard the best estimate for the total cost of the wool is the tailors used 3 and 7 a so that's 4 of the world across 12 so that's 4 times 12 which is 48 this is most likely going to be less than 48 because the 3 and 7/8 is less than 4 so each is our answer for our next section of practice for number one it says which expression is equivalent to three twelfths divided by 2/5 remember keep change flip the be 312 times two over five is equivalent for chooses which expression is equivalent to five six times one-half keep change flip so five six times I'm sorry five six divided by two keep change flip yes five six divided by two for 13 we have five over twelve divided by five over six so that's five over twelve times 6 over 5 the 12 becomes two six becomes one the fives both become one so that's just 1/2 for 4 it says Alana has 12 yards of fabric four pillows each pillow takes two thirds of a yard how many pillows can she make so we're just doing 12 divided by 2/3 so that's 12 over 1 times 3 over 2 the 2 becomes 1 12 become 6 6 times 3 is 18 5 says mr. lone Nolan is making 6 sandwiches from 3/4 pounds of Turkey how much or how much turkey is on each sandwich so 6 and 3/4 so 6 sandwiches from 3/4 so we do 3/4 divided by 6 so 6 is 6 over 1 we keep change flip that's 3 over 4 times 1 over 6 we're going to simplify the 3 become 1 6 becomes 2 that's 1 over 8 pounds six says divide eight and two fifths divided by 1 and 1/2 I'm going to turn these into improper fractions first so we're going to have 8 times 5 is 40 plus 2 is 42 or 5 divided by 1 times 2 is 2 plus 1 is 3 over 2 so keep change flip that's 42 over 5 times 2 over 3 3 becomes 1 42 becomes 14 so 14 times 2 is 28 over 5 times 1 which is 5 5 goes into 28 5 times with 3 left over so that's 5 and three-fifths first 7 this is the best estimate of 31 and 3/4 divided by 4 and 1/7 is the 331 and 3/4 is saying like 32 divided by 4 that's about 4 so that's going to be 8 so see 8's switch which quotient is about 7 so for F we would have 24 divided by 4 which is 6 that's not 7/4 H we would have 36 divided by 4 which is about 9 that's not 7 G we have 48 and 7/8 says about 49 divided by 7 which is 7 so G would be your answer for 9 we're dividing 5 over 12 and five ninths so there's going to be 5 over 12 times 9 over 5 the 5s become once 2 12 becomes 4 9 becomes 3 so that's just 3/4 and for 10 we have zero divided by one in seven eighths zero divided by anything is zero you cannot divide something by 0 so 0 divided by anything is zero if you had something divided by 0 it would be undefined", "xM0lABTBD-U": "all right so here we are looking at 7.2 we're gonna start out with a number 39 so you're just want to simplify the expression so when I'm looking this expression here I have another guest joining us for class welcome Maddie now did you have any questions for the 7.2 homework all right we're gonna assume not but if you do let me know so here we got 7.2 number 39 and we're looking at just trying to simplify this expression so I have a root 3 on top and I have a root 3 on bottom so if I wanted to rewrite this thing I could write it in exponential form more often than not I will rewrite it in exponential form just because I think people have a little bit easier time seeing this thing but really it's the same either way so I'm gonna just represent it as 4 to the 1/3 oops over here I have 32 to the one-third so if I have something looks like a to the X divided by B to the X this can be simplified to just being a over B raised to the X so here again our power our property of exponents coming into play here so I'm gonna rewrite this thing as 4 over 32 all raised to the 1/3 and again if you want to have a cube root instead you want to have it represented like this it means the exact same thing doesn't matter either way so what am I going to do next I have 4 over 32 so I want to simplify this thing I'm gonna say okay 32 divided by 2 is 16 divided by 2 is 4 cool so this thing is going to turn into 1/8 raised to the one-third and this one down here will do consistent notation here cube root of 1/8 so now I want to either do one of two things one I want to maybe change the way this 8 looks or I just want to split this thing up and look at each individual cube root so I'm gonna split this up back into each individual cube root so as I do this I'm gonna split this out let's get hold in here and so I'm gonna say okay well this thing is going to equal 1 to the 1/3 which is pretty straightforward and this could be your final answer as well but here we're gonna continue simplifying so it depends on what this bottom term is so like say for example this was on 7 right if it was 1/7 raised to the 1/3 this could be your final answer but here we can simplify a little bit further so let's split this into 8 to the 1/3 on the bottom lips and we have 1 to the 1/3 on top 1 to the 1/3 which is the cube root of 1 which is just 1 here I have 8 to the 1/3 so the cube root of 8 is just 2 so my final answer here would be 1/2 and you can do that from here as well one thing we could do is we could rewrite this as 8 to the negative 1 and here this is a cube root I can move this negative 1 on to the outside so if I wanted to rewrite this as cube root of 8 and then this whole thing raised to the negative 1 we can rewrite it like that the cube root of 8 is 2 2 to the negative 1 is 1/2 so it doesn't matter which way you pursue at which notation you use we're still going to get to the same conclusion any questions on 39 perfect looking in 47 here we'd sure write the expression in simplest form so basically I see this thing and I have a six root on the bottom with 81 I want to find a way of simplifying this I do not want a radical in my denominator so I'm gonna have to maybe come up with a clever way of getting this thing to go away so when I look at this I see 81 and may not be immediately apparent to you like what 81 is or like what its significance is but basically if I have 3 raised to the 4th it's gonna give me 81 so again I don't really expect you guys to know like what these things are off the top of your head but one thing we could do is I could say okay well what does 81 break down into breaks into 3 which is the hardest number to draw on the stylus thing and then what does 27 break out into and then continue breaking this down till we get to our prime factorization trick and we can always do this so again don't stress needing to memorize 81 you will see 81 pop up a lot 21 pops up showing me 27 pops up a lot like will see these cubes again if you want to identify like one or two you know numbers raised to the fourth that'd be helpful but again don't feel like you need to do it so I'm just gonna rewrite this thing using 3 to the fourth so now I'm gonna just rewrite this as 2 over the sixth root of 3 to the fourth okay this thing has a fourth degree this thing has a index of 6 so this radical here has a force field strength of 6 to break out this thing needs a force field strength of 6 as well so how am I going to make this a 6 I'm going to need to multiply by the 6 root of 3 squared so if I do that on the bottom I need to also do that on the top so here I'm going to multiply by the 6 root of 3 squared the goal here again is to get this degree to match this index this is what's gonna get me there so again if I want to get to six I do three or maybe four plus two right three to the fourth times 3 to the second equals 3 to the oh my goodness this is whatever you can see it fine so this is going to give me 3 to the 6 so when I'm doing this it's gonna simplify to look like the 6 root of 3 to the 6 and now on top here I just have 2 on the outside and then here I have the 6 root of 9 so nothing really I can do with this 3 squared it's not strong enough to break out on the bottom I'm going to simplify that just call this thing 3 because again I have 3 to the 6 6 root of 3 to 6 is just 3 so on top here then I get to root 6 of 9 and I am done please do not cancel this 3 here with this 9 here right this is a root 6 of 9 this is just a 3 ounce okay off any questions on 27 or 47 scuse me perfect look at 71 here so here we just want to write this thing in simplest form assume all the variables are positive so I basically just don't worry about the variables giving you any trouble so as I look at this thing I have a square root times the square root I have a square root times the square root I'm going to multiply the things underneath so I'm gonna do that as my first step so I'm gonna call this thing too because I have a constant right here and I'll actually do each of these the zone color so I don't have any constant that I see here so it's assumed to be 1 1 times 2 is 2 for my X I have an X here and then I have no X's over here so I just have X to the first for my Y's I have a Y here I have y to the third here so I have Y to the fourth and then for my Z's I have a Z over here in a Z right here so I'm gonna get Z or some u Z to the fourth here so I'm gonna get Z to the fifth okay as I look at this thing I don't see a number for my index so that means this thing right here is two right this is just a normal square root so if I could have the square root of all this stuff that means I'm gonna split these things into nice squares if I can write because that's going to be what comes out of this thing the two is gonna remain a two there's no square there nothing I can do actually gonna remain an X nothing I can do there the Y to the fourth I'm gonna split into y squared + y squared the reason I'm doing this is getting I can take this Y squared out so it's going to come out as just a Y the Z I'm going to split into Z squared Z scopes I'm using the wrong we're using purple instead of indigo here get with it Z squared Z squared + Z so when I look at this thing I want to say okay well what is coming on the outside I've got a Y squared a Y squared Z squared and a Z squared so on the outside this is going to become Y Y Z Z and all these things are being multiplied so just keep that in mind 31:55 yeah we'll get to those to get my square root here so now I'm looking at what's left underneath I have my two I have my X and I've got one of my Z's left over so now in terms of my final answer what's my final answer gonna be Y times y gives me Y squared Z times Z gives me Z squared square root X is e and I am good to go any questions here wait what about the Z squared and the y squared that are left like in the problem the final answer here I mean no like if you take out only one of the square things when they're still be like a Y to the second power and a Z to the second power in the problem I have my Y to the second power and see the second power right here yeah but there's another one originally in the problem so wouldn't that still be in the like the square root thing nope so this Y squared on the inside turns into a Y on the outside I take the square root of a square I just get that thing itself oh I get it okay good question I'll see ya yeah miss you yeah I was just wondering cuz I'm the classroom so seven point one homework was due on Friday and then seven point two is due today and then it says seven point three two on Wednesday so I'm just wondering if there's any homework due tomorrow there is not okay so we just have a break yeah I mean basically it's a catch-up day okay does that make sense yes cool thank you any other questions on 71 here perfect all right scoot down a bit here check out 91 so again I wouldn't worry about this one too too much but we all talked about it so here's like more just pulling in our geometry knowledge so we have the area two circles are 15 square centimeters and 20 square centimeters so I'm gonna say circle one I guess I'll say the area of circle one equals 15 and I will say the area of circle two equals 20 find exact ratio of the radius of the smaller circle to the radius of larger circle well in order to do this I need to know that the area of a circle equals PI R squared so once I know that I'm able to solve for my radius so I look at the first one I'm say okay well this is gonna be 15 equals PI R squared so when I'm solving for this I'm going to divide by PI first so I get 15 whoops over PI equals my R squared value and I'm going to take the square root I'm going to take the square root keep in mind that when I'm taking the square root here it's plus or minus but since I have a circle I have the limitation that I can only have a positive length for my radius so my radius here is just going to be the positive one so it's going to be the square root of 15 over pi so that's the radius for the first one for the next one here I'm gonna do the same steps all the way through the only thing different is now I'm doing 20 so my radius for this one is going to be the square root of 20 over pi and now it wants us so the actual like goal this problem is to find the exact ratio the radius of the smaller circle to the radius of the larger circle so I'm basically gonna do the red one over the orange one so I'm going to just be doing R divided by r here so when I'm looking at this problem write these things in square root actually I'll do in the same color still just to stay consistent with it so here I got route 15 oops over PI separate our colors here to do cool so the first thing I would say I would look at this and do is I see this is a square root and so I'm gonna split my root into my numerator denominator and I'm gonna see that I get my root PI's to cancel off so here we got root 15 over square root pi divided by so I use this double sign here root 20 over root pi again so if you want to just cancel off this root pi as you can if you want to do the whole flip multiplication thing you can so if you want to think about this as being root 15 over root pi times and then flip this root PI over root 20 you can so this becomes root 15 over root 20 again I have a root here so if I got a root on top root on bottom I have the same degree we can now combine these things under one root which is 15 over 20 or jute 15 over 20 so now from here I'm going to simplify so I can divide this entire thing by my 5s so I get root 3 over 4 as I look at this thing I'm going to split this out again so I get root 3 over root 4 and then root 4 simplifies to just be 2 so my final answer here would be root 3 over 2 any questions on 91 sorry the work kind of like took a swing around this way rather than just continuing down perfect there were two other questions asked that's thirty one and fifty five so let's get those ones all right 31:55 so let's start with 31 here so we're looking at 31 here it's simplify the expression the biggest thing I would try and advise you guys to get in the habit of doing is starting to break down these numbers when you see a 125 I don't want to personally think of it as a 125 I want to think about it as 5 to the 3rd but before we get into doing that let's just do the multiplication part on top so here I have 125 raised to a power times 1/4 125 raised to a power if I have 125 and 125 being multiplied I'm just gonna add their exponents so this is going to be 125 here I'm get to 9th plus 1/9 which is 3/9 3/9 is 1/3 so there's my first move there and now I want to look at this thing and say okay well what is 125 raised to the 1/3 the cube root of 125 is 5 here I get 5 to the 1/4 on the bottom still these fours are coming out less than ideal so now if I have 5 to the 1st right this is to the first even though I don't see it divided by 5 to the 1/4 I'm doing division my division property of exponent says I'm going to take and subtract my exponents so now my final answer here would be 5 to the 3/4 any questions on 31 perfect looking at 85 here next just want to perform the indicated operations so here we're just adding these things up right now as I look at this just at like a first first glance I literally can't do this right I have 176 and I have 11 so if I wanted to add these two things together they need to have the same root radical sign and the thing inside of it so here it's got route forward route for which I like but then it's got 176 and 11 nah I'm pretty stuck there so I look at this I say okay well maybe there actually is a way that I can add these together maybe this one can be simplified because I look at the route 11 there's nothing that breaks down further from here so 11 is just 11 times 1 it's a prime there's nothing I can do to simplify that there's no way this is changing at all this 176 though looks like to me it breaks down if you're not sure what to do I would say always just look at it and say like Oh 176 is even and you can go that route or you can say oh I kind of want it to be 11 so maybe I'll try dividing by 11 again multiple approaches just really trying to break down this 176 to a prime factorization tree I'm gonna go the route of just saying okay I see it's an even number so I'm gonna divide it by 2 so 176 divided by 2 gives me 88 and then my see my 88 and that can be 2 and 44 looks like it can be 2 and 22 and this looks like an be 2 and 11 and now I see I have my prime factorization here so I'm just gonna rewrite this one as 2 on the outside fourth root of 2 and I'm going to write this to the fourth the reason I'm writing it to the fourth is I want 4 things right 1 2 3 4 I've got 4 of them so I'm gonna rewrite this as 2 to the fourth times 11 now again what can happen if I have a fourth degree thing inside of a fourth root I can bring it on the outside so this 2 is going to come on the outside now so I'm going to have two from before time now I've got this too right here and then I've still got my 4th root of 11 so now I look at this I say oh I can actually add these things together so this is just gonna give me 4 4 through 11 and would say plus my 5 4 through 11 again this matches this so I'm saying 5 apples pushing me four apples plus five apples cool ends up giving me 9 apples it just happens that my apples here our fourth root of 11 s not quite as tasty as a Mac any questions on this one perfect any other 7.2 questions where I close out this homework session just in terms of the recording alrighty we're good to go", "5M4fYboYgys": "what's up what's going on how are you today you are going to answer a question and questions about how many ants and a quart okay - on third question I should provide the answer oh there is it answer one quart is equal to 32 arms okay but we're going to yeah we will not we are not answer these and done now we're not doing only therefore we're going to make a question-and-answer session for the city well um for example I want to contract your cork into well how much is to pour in and I'll be done to that question first you need to write this number to take and multiply it with one chord because to multiple one chord to pour one for okay then equal sign okay and then it equals to walk because we have to in lecto must have two interaction and it will must like it with this okay so this is how it become okay so to multiply one chord is equal to 2 chord equal sign to multiply 32 is equal to 64 well that's answer of the question if you have any query question or something that your Johnston contributing directly a pet in question in the coming boss only YouTube in this video we take and then if you find this video is really helpful view then I will suggest you to help your friend you help us by subscribe this channel and don't forget to share it to your friends ok so I think that's all thank you for watching and see you later", "XOqWSMtZFRA": "hey what's going on guys well I want to make quick video kind of a heads up to save a couple bucks if you're one of those people who like to pick up ammo from Walmart I was recently at Walmart and I was getting some household items and I tend to gravitate towards the outdoor section I like looking at the sports stuff and like looking at you know the fishing gear and of course they have new knives in the case and an ammo of course I always like to check the ammo prices check to see the new guns and stuff like that and I have to notice something so I want to make this video talking about it now I was a little low on shotgun ammo just some target rounds and I'm used to buying these big bulk packs these are 100 round packs all right this one happens to be Winchester so basically we have a hundred rounds here 12-gauge two and three quarter inch shells number eight shot okay one 1/8 ounce um and I'm used to buying these around 21 to 23 dollars this depends when you go really but I didn't notice they had a whole end cap for this these are federal boxes it's the same ammunition okay federal and Winchester is both made in America marked on the box okay so it's american-made same specifications for looking for just some target loads these are 25 round boxes and these boxes end up being let's see there's my receipts these were four dollars and ninety four cents each and the bulk pack was 2174 so I realized that that was cheaper cheaper to buy it in the individual 25 round boxes as opposed to the big bulk pack so let's see real quick here 494 one ninety four times four of them which gives you a hundred rounds is nineteen dollars and seventy six cents as compared to twenty ones let's say 2174 only one 24 minus nineteen seventy-six equals a dollar ninety eight savings so I thought that's pretty cool so yeah if you're going to bulk pack it's a little cheaper almost $2 cheaper to just get four twenty five round boxes of the federal and you know since he's our target loads and most people are using these as target loads it should make a difference either way so just a quick heads-up people think like two bucks us I'm worth watching this video I think it is two dollars may not seem like a lot of money but if you do a lot of different things in your life to save money it all adds up you know what I mean we're in a new year here part of you know one of the things I want to focus on in 2016 is just saving money conservative money spending a little bit more wisely I think we're all guilty of you know wasting money in certain aspects of our life whereas we try to save and others kind of balance itself out a little bit so yeah if you want those people out there looking for discounts looking for a good deal this is a good deal okay so next time you might not want to consider getting the bulk pack you might actually be cheaper getting a couple to smaller ones so there you go quick heads up save you a couple bucks that's all thanks for watching guys hope you have an awesome day and I'll see you soon take care"}
