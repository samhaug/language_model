organizers having just come off of a big global meeting I really appreciate all that work all the work that goes into this and truly its blood sweat and tears but this is a successful meeting and I did hear Dominic say that you did no advertising so that's a testament to how rapidly this area is growing okay I have no commercial relationships to disclose and I just want to start out by defining ketogenic diet therapy because I helped many of that work in this light to take the word diet out of there and talk more about the therapy because it it really is a therapy that encompasses several components so on the diet end this is highly simplified but fat is the main source of calories and a lot of people take days weeks and months to digest this mentally and to wrap their heads around it so we talked about it up front and get them used to this concept protein is provided to meet needs I'll come back to that a little bit later and carbohydrate is minimized and this is individualized to specific goals and again I'll come back to this the therapy part is that there is a huge emotional adaption and having been nutritionists for many many years I came upon this diet sort of by default and having worked with all of the therapies in hospital setting renal diets diabetic diets cystic fibrosis diets etc there is none that came close to the powerful results that I saw with us and I decided after my first child that this was it for me that I was going to only do this for the rest of my career hydration needs to be part of the therapy I'm gonna come back to that micronutrient supplementation is critical and fasting is something I talk to every single person that I work with but I have to define that because fasting simply means without food so what do we mean for some it might be just going without food for 12 hours which is supposed to be what we're you know all supposed to do we don't eat during the night and 10 or 12 hours is not hard to do some people need longer fasting I fast myself every Monday starting Sunday after dinner so I'll go either 24 or 36 hours so I invite my patients to join me in solidarity and that seems to be very helpful and sometimes we go longer but this is very individualized depending on what goal the therapy has for them and then laboratory studies we do quite a bit in children that have epilepsy which is the first application that I used this therapy for for about 10 years and we did quite a bit of blood work however I know that this is not possible everywhere and I believe that these are the minimum laboratory studies that should be done on anyone for a couple reasons one for safety but also to prevent people from coming off the diet early if something does look abnormal oftentimes there's abnormalities before starting someone on the therapy and they can improve on the diet so I use it you know for safety but also to help keep people on the therapy to prove that they're doing fine so since we're talking so much about science I had to throw this slide in this is how I approach people this is a end of one trial and that simply means that the single patient is the entire trial so again it's a very individualized therapy and I'm gonna give you a two examples from the low end of the spectrum in terms of control to a very controlled therapy so this is pretty typical of a lot of people that I work with that come to me with migraine headache and apparently it's 15% of females that have this disorder about 10% in males and I run into this frequently just in my personal circle of friends and family but this particular woman 32 year old female with migraine headaches for about eight years she was trialed on topiramate which is actually an anti-seizure medication and it made her very dopey so she stopped taking it she was hospitalized twice for dehydration due to nauseant not in vomit from a migraine and if any of you have ever had a migraine it's very debilitating and you just want to die it's just you just feel you know horrible giy she had constipation and endocrine she was moderately obese diet-wise skips breakfast eats convenience foods for lunch but she has a dinner with a family that is usually home-cooked foods so I'm just showing you some of the pertinent details from her her history and her intake and not everything social wise she's a full time graduate student to school age kids her husband is very supportive and she had mentioned to me several times that her life is very very stressful and she's also sedentary so um I asked her to keep a food diary which I knew was gonna be difficult because she hardly had time to go to the bathroom so she said what about if I just send you pictures of what I'm eating and I said that's perfectly fine so you know I asked her for honesty just be honest with me I'm I'm your therapist I'm not here to judge you I'm here to help you so she sent me this is one day of her diet now these are not all of the foods that she ate but these are the ones that I picked out is being problematic and she started her morning with a latte and she thought she was eating a very healthy yogurt for lunch and she'd have a snack in the afternoon of some type of bar and then she always carried a beverage along with her to sip on during the day and then this nice big muffin from Costco and this is just part of her day but right here well over 200 grams of carbohydrate right so this brings me to something that I discuss with everybody at some point in time who eats like this whether they want to try ketogenic or not but are seeking my advice and that's this thing called sugar addiction and it's very real and we all have it even I am sugar addicted even though I don't eat sugar it would be very easy for me to go back to it and I even I am tempted even though I'm in ketosis and my appetite is you know very normalized we all have this and this has been proven in mice and I and I regret not throwing my slide in here citing the study actually was rats but rats were fed or offered a choice between cocaine and sugar and which do they pick they pick sugar so it is you know physiological addiction and once we talk about that and recognize it you know we can embrace this a little bit easier rather than just thinking you know I can eat whatever I want and I like being I like being able to not restrict myself but we put in terms of an addiction and then we start to stay back sit back and say oh my gosh I can't help myself we see people totally getting off of sugar once they go into ketosis and it's not a problem for them anymore this is this is something pretty magical about being in ketosis it just they just have such satiation from all the fat that they're getting but they're not tempted as much some are but we have people that so-called cheat I call that an experiment what did you learn from it when you went and had something that's not cheating and it's an experiment but anyways coming back to this woman with migraine her goal was to eliminate migraines and she used the word desperate I am desperate I is just a mess and I can't imagine living like this so our first plan was not even to talk about ketogenic diet I said let's just clean up your diet and and she was perplexed by that what do you mean clean up my diet I think I eat pretty healthy so I said you know what let's give this like a month and see how you do with cleaning up your diet and I'm going to explain that in a minute and then our plan B will be to go on to a ketogenic diet so she bought into that and this is something that I developed with a Charly foundation is called a Whole Foods diet it's sugar-free and gluten-free and why is it gluten-free well the classic ketogenic diet designed in 1923 is a gluten-free diet people don't refer to it as that but just by nature of the limited carbohydrate we are eliminating greens so it's a gluten-free diet and of course it's sugar-free and we put this together to show people these are the foods on a ketogenic diet it's unlimited in this step you can eat what you want but it teaches you to eat fat so this is just the top half of the for the first page there's four pages of this and we are giving this out at the Charlie Foundation table so you're welcome to to see the rest of it but it starts off with recommending protein and then fat and the carbohydrate is below this and then we go on to explain more in detail a week's worth of our menus and alternatives to pasta and bread and this type of thing but more most importantly it teaches people they have to eat fat with each meal and why is that important I'm gonna come back to it one thing I did want to talk to her about right away is alternatives to what she was doing to help give her some practical guidance she just had to have her caffeine in the morning which is totally fine and pretty common among all of us very evident by the line every morning every midday and every afternoon outside the bulletproof table and I'm at the table right next to them so I've been actually helping them put cups out because the line is so long that nobody can see me so so here we go so I have a coherence my pointer so what can we do instead of a lot of table if you've had their coffee you know it's they're putting butter into to some people like cream in coffee you get a little bit more fat and calories with the butter and it's very low carb what about that yogurt that healthy apparently healthy yogurt that's loaded with sugar there are high fat Greek yogurts and you can put just a little bit of berries in there just a little handful of berries very satisfying why is there so much sugar in this sports bar okay we have recipes for seed crackers chia seeds flax seeds etc and companies are coming out with these products so that they're more convenient this in on the right is kombucha which I'm gonna come back to a little bit later but a very healthy low-carb although some of them have fruit juices add to them but you want to look for the lower carb one I've gotten people off of their laxatives with this I've gotten people off of drinking diet soda all day which I'm gonna come back to later and then what about that muffin again there are products you've had some of them here coming out in the market in the past few years that are great alternatives or people can make these at home there's great recipe book lists and book cookbooks available these days so what about non-food carbohydrates these can be a significant source of carbs for some people I know of people who drink sports beverages like it was water right two or three times two or three bottles of this Gatorade high carb drink and they do make low carb ones that that are fine but watch out for the carb in sports drinks what about medications we have to really watch for this in children because most children's medications are either syrups elixirs or chewable tablets that are sweetened to help get them down these can be significant what happens if you go into the hospital what do they hook up right away an IV with dextrose that's sugar so they can give you an IV without sugar you have to ask for it 20 percent dextrose means there's 20 grams of carbohydrate in a leader so the first thing that I did when I went in to visit a patient in the hospital who had come in urgently for something non non epilepsy related is walk over to the IV bag and make sure there was no dextrous in the IV because that often got overlooked even in the hospital what about sweeteners well sweeteners are 100 percent carbohydrate it doesn't matter how natural they are honey and agave nectar and coconut syrup their carbohydrate questionable sweeteners there's a study just from a few years ago that looked at the microbe quality of the gut after giving mice artificial sweeteners and it not only altered the microbiota but they found that it affected glucose tolerance so that's done in mice there are studies coming out soon in adults showing what happens with artificial sweeteners and also what happens on ketogenic therapy I can't wait for that one to come out but the other point is that when you're in ketosis it alters your taste buds and it magnifies the acute knee of acuity of sweetness so I can eat something and say oh my gosh that's so sweet and my husband can eat the same thing and say this is really bland okay we don't need the sweetening in foods once we're in ketosis okay coming back to this woman with migraines after nine months she was migraine free she was spilling trace in small ketones in her urine our goal was not to go into heat ptosis but what was happening is that she was burning her own body fat and that was contributing to ketones she lost 15 pounds that wasn't what we focused on but it inherently happened and when we talk about calorie restriction people think about how do I have to count my calories and no we don't count but when you are when you eat a whole foods diet you automatically are calorie restricting it just happens because you don't overeat especially when you're incorporating fat so this is wonderful that I don't have to explain you're on a calorie restricted diet you just don't know what you can eat as much of these lower carb vegetables as you want stay within the fat limits that I've advised but pretty much they can fill up and they feel very satisfied and they don't overeat so it's a caloric restriction by design not by intent she also reported that she wasn't as hungry as before she was going three or four hours and skipping snacks right so this is a culture here where we graze all day long we have food available everywhere we turn and she was passing up the treats and there alone was some caloric restriction over what she had previously been doing her cholesterol and LDL went up and if any of you listen to David diamond you know that this is not something to be concerned about it went up because she was losing weight and she was breaking down fat so it was mobilizing the cholesterol in her body it eventually came down about nine months out we saw it normalize she got off of her commercial laxatives which is something I spent lots of time talking to people about and telling them I'm gonna ask you about your bowel habits you're just gonna have to get used to it but it's very important to know that you are having a bowel movement if not every day then every other day okay so the plan was let's just continue this Whole Foods diet making sure she's getting about three tablespoons of fat with each meal which I figured it was about 50% of her calories and this is at 50% is barely ketosis but again she has some more fat to lose and we aren't focusing on weight loss that wasn't one of her goals but we we know that that's just a benefit of of her eating this way case history number two is somebody with epilepsy this is a 13 year old girl with intractable epilepsy that means seizures that are resistant to standard therapy she was trialed on seven different anti epileptic drugs and currently was on CBD oil which is cannabidiol oil from hemp and she the the drugs not only didn't help her seizures she was suffering some from adverse side effects of the drugs with the oil she was not suffering any side effects and she had months of pretty good seizure control but then started to fall apart the family had been trying a modified Adkins diet on their own there's a lot of information on the internet so they were doing this on their own but I had them check her glucose and report it to me in the morning and I was a little suspicious that it was it's normal but at the high end of normal especially for a young person and her ketones were trace so they you know they've made great attempts to follow what they thought was a ketogenic diet but just needed some help structuring that a little bit more if she was at her ideal body weight she was also doing gluten-free and the eldest of two children active when she's not having seizures and she verbalized that she would do anything to control her seizures she just knew that her life was a mess and so for this family I gave them again at Charlie Foundation publication to show them the different ketogenic therapies that are in the literature and so the therapy the four different therapies that have been published pretty extensively are at the top and this is the classic ketogenic diet and the MCT oil dye both designed in the 1920s I also have this out at the table if anybody wants a copy low glycemic index treatment this is a hybrid ketogenic diet and then modified Atkins another hybrid diet so the first three rows you see they're all yeses is that medically supervised is that high in fat is it low in carbohydrate this is what they have in common and then we start to see the logistics differ quite a bit as we go down what is the ratio of fat to carbohydrate protein in the classic ketogenic diet week we can actually modulate it because it's so structured we can modulate it to any ratio the MCT oil diet is about a 1 to 1 and the low glycemic index is also about a 1 to 1 and modified Atkins is a little higher about a 2 to 1 how much carbohydrate would be allowed on a thousand calories excuse me it's pushing too hard here on a thousand calories you can see the 4 to 1 is the most strict in carb 3 to 116 2 to 130 and 40 to 60 on a 1 to 1 the MCT oil diet between 40 and 50 local ice emic between 40 and 60 and these dependant no matter how many calories this is the carbohydrate restriction and then modified Atkins the stipulation is we you start off with about 10 grams for adolescents or 15 grams for adults for about a month and then you liberalize it to about 20 grams and then again this is very individualized these are just like starting places for all of these there are peas how our foods measured and these two structured diets are either weighed or measured and in household measuring cups tablespoons teaspoons low glycemic measured or estimated and modified is just estimated our meal plans use yes and for modified Kent Atkins it's optional where's the diet started these are tend to be started in the hospital although as a private practice nutritionist I work with people at home I just start them out much more gradually than we would in a hospital where we would start quickly and we would wrap rapidly initiate them to get them home before the kid starts getting picky but I've done this safely and at long distances people on the other side of the world very gradually over weeks and even months and it's quite safe and these two are meant to be done at home our calories controlled yes on these first three no unmodified Atkins our vitamin and mineral supplements use yes across the board our fluids restricted no across-the-board this is a myth from long ago that you restrict fluids and it related to the degree of ketosis in the urine and now we have a much more sophisticated methods of checking for ketones that besides urine and so urine if you don't drink very much your ketones getting very strong because your urine is concentrated we want people to drink on these therapies because the ketosis has a very strong diuretic effect that means you lose fluid very easily and so you need to replace that by drinking is our pre diet laboratory evaluations that required yes across-the-board and can there be side effects yes across-the-board so there's actually a lot more similarities in all these therapies and there are differences it's just the logistics of teaching and managing and again as I said before we may start somebody off very liberal and move them over to more structured diets and we tend to start children off on a very structured diet and then liberalize them to get them off or to maintain them and then we can move around between diets so common element of care is taking this MCT oil diet and using that MCT oil in these other three therapies so experienced ketogenic nutritionists don't focus in on one specific diet other than to get it started and then work with the individual for tolerance and how they emotionally are adapting and then adjust it over time so there's lots of flexibility and then people with feeding tubes we tend to use a very structured diet and that's one of my specialties I work with individuals that aren't able to eat orally and have feeding tubes so we can blend up whole foods just like anybody would be eating and put them down a feeding tube and there's there's commercial products available too so there's lots of options so going back to the second case history her goal was to eliminate seizures and we wanted to start with a structured ketogenic diet so she she wasn't very active at the time although she got more active so we usually start off with a base like goal calories for sedentary and then add ketogenic snacks to make up for the activity for the calories for an inactivity and they can double the snack or leave the snack out on a day that they're not active 164 grams of fat 62 grams of protein this is about a gram per kilogram and I can show you fancy predictive equations for calculating protein this is something that nutritionists love to get into and talk about and argue about but it's I can simplify that by saying we want to meet their protein needs we can go as low as about point six grams per kilogram and I've gone up as high as two grams per kilo so it's very individual and the more active somebody it is the more calories they're gonna take in and they're more room for them to eat more protein but one of them the mistakes I see commonly with people trying to do this on their own is that they're taking in too much protein because they have this idea that protein does not affect their glucose level so I'll come back to that in a moment to will excuse me she is 20 grams of carbohydrate per day which is what they were trying to do on their own and then I had her monitor not only her glucose level but her blood level of ketones and Patricia is gonna go into more about monitoring so I'm not gonna belabor that point the hydration is really important it's actually the first thing I teach somebody when we're talking about a ketogenic therapy that they have to be vigil about drinking every day and once they get into that routine it's second nature but why why dehydration causes your heart to pump faster right water carries red blood cells with oxygen to cells if you feel like you're getting sleepy sitting here for a couple hours drink and you'll brighten up a little bit right and then water removes toxins from waste and from the from waste products from the blood and sufficient hydration can prevent constipation and kidney stones and the incidence of kidney stones actually on the ketogenic diet is no higher than it is for somebody just on a regular diet but because it's been reported and we know that it can occur if you're not drinking enough and I've only seen it in people that are taking drugs that also cause kidney stones and there's a couple of anti epileptic drugs that can cause kidney stones so sometimes they are passing a kidney stone because I told them to start drinking once we get into the diet and those kidney stones have been sitting there for a while now we're moving them out so we pay attention to people that are complaining about pain during urination and get them checked out right away especially if they were on the medications that can cause kidney stones so you've seen the slide several times from other speakers I just want to remind you that you can get ketones through fasting this is actually how the diet was invented many years ago and fat cells break down into fatty acids and convert to ketones in the liver and those enter into the bloodstream so again we can check the ketones in the blood we can check them crudely in the urine and now we can also check them by exhaled breath so the ketogenic diet mimics fasting fat is the main source of calories and I'm going to talk a little bit more about different types of fat but the classic diet was actually based on mostly dairy fat butter and heavy cream heavy whipping cream now we've kind of modernized it by introducing monounsaturated fats and and saturated fats like coconut oil and MCT oil carbohydrate is limited and if I could feed everybody that I work with I would feed them vegetables for their source of carbs now not everybody is that pure istic about it but they realize soon they get more volume if they eat the lowest carbohydrate vegetables so I also try to introduce them to rhubarb which is a vegetable but we think of it as a fruit and how satisfying that can be and you can usually get this year-round in freezers in the grocery store so this is this has opened up lots of recipes for people that I work with with either making it into smoothies or cooking it down and adding it to they're on their low-carb crackers as like a jelly and then berries because berries are the highest phytonutrient and highest fiber fruit and they are fairly low in carbohydrate compared to other fruit and then protein we try to encourage whole food sources although things like bacon and sausage can work into the diet just as well so I want to step back again and talk a little bit about how those macronutrients affect glucose levels and I'm using a red line here to represent simple sugars so when you eat that hard candy on the table back there what happens is your glucose spikes up right if we had hard candy on our table at the banth meeting and I contacted the banquet manager and I said please go around and remove those from the table because they just put them out there they don't ask you right and so we don't think about this this is just part of our culture but this is what happens your glucose Rises quickly and then it falls within about an hour and then we have complex carbohydrates so fruits and whole grains and it also rises and not as high and comes down and then you consume protein protein actually if you add it to carbohydrate it slows down the curve but then some protein it's converted to glucose right so then it eventually rises and fat which doesn't have a glycemic index at all it doesn't raise your glucose but if you add it to this mix it actually lowers that Fleiss emic index it lowers that effect so what happens with a ketogenic therapy well we eliminate sugar okay and if you experiment with your diet and eat sugar you're going to find that it's going to knock you out of ketosis so you learn quickly that that's not a good experiment to repeat all right carbohydrate we reduce significantly protein for most people as far less than what they had been eating they don't realize that not just the chicken and the fish have protein but vegetables have protein too and it can be significant depending on which you pick and most people are eating more than they really need so we're bringing that down and then fat is the main source of calories so that lowers the glycemic index and this is a glycemic curve in a child I worked with children solely for about 10 years and their glucose levels no matter what ketogenic the ratio we had them on ranged between 55 and 75 and that was one of our ways to know if they were compliant and I didn't matter what time of day you checked it was rocks table with adults I see it's between 10 and 20 points higher and that's just the nature of the beast so macronutrients interplay and one affects the other protein as you know is essential for tissue maintenance and tissue growth particularly in children and sorry here I'm snap happy here carbohydrate feeds the glycolysis pathway but so does proteins some proteins are glycolytic so they'll feed into this glycolytic pathway a lot of people don't realize fat which biochemically is triglycerides is composed of a glycerol molecule plus three fatty acids so when those split apart the glycerol feeds the glycolytic pathway and this is what's supporting glucose in the blood when we're not eating hard okay so one of the mistakes I see people make a lot is if we are getting low glucose below nor all below that low-normal that we see with ketogenic they automatically want to give somebody more carbohydrate and typically it's not that they need more carbohydrates just they need more calories and most of that is going to be from fat so the second child as I mentioned earlier we wanted to provide a structured ketogenic diet and this is a snapshot from a keto diet calculator again funded by the Charlie foundation and she is able to create meals she or her parents and I actually start started them out by designing some meals for her based on the goal of protein fat and carbohydrate and she her goals per meal are at the bottom this is a two to one ratio 600 calories this is one of her three meals she's her meals are eight or her diet is 1800 calories a day so we don't talk in terms of breakfast lunch and supper we just talk about meals because they're all interchangeable and they're able to fluctuate if they want more protein in a meal and less carbohydrate they can do that we just don't want them cheating out in the proton the protein so this is a very structured very organized way for them to get on track with weighing foods and measuring them and most people this H teenagers are capable of doing this for a while and then they get the intuitive sense of the amounts and they can put the scale away okay and that usually takes between one and three months of being on therapy and sometimes they come back to the scale of things go out off the rocker so this is what our our plan was with her and I keep showing you this picture in the background this is one of her favorite meals it's it's I'll show and and that's what you saw in the calculation this is simply fish and this is a avocado mayonnaise with a little bit of lemon juice and Parmesan cheese and you just broil it you put the sauce over the top and broil it and it's truly delicious and it just takes a few minutes and then she's got all this broccoli here to go with it so she was very compliant to this 82% fat diet her seizures didn't until about two weeks and this is quite typical with with epilepsy we don't see changes often times right away in fact we sit just waiting three months to see a change but three months later she's helping to prepare her own meals and seizure control continues to improve she's still having seizures but not nearly as many she's going back to school she's starting to rejoin her activity and this is another typical day I asked her what she what her favorite meals are and she like many teenage girls tends to want vegetarian meals that's a big thing in this age group so they don't really like to eat much meat so here's a hemp hearts porridge with chia seeds and hemp hearts are very high in protein so they work really well with us she's got we've encouraged her doing a tablespoon of MCT oil with each meal to help ketosis and this is a blender meal she likes doing this the night before and freezing it and taking it to school she's got rhubarb a cup is about three grams of carbohydrate so it's quite low there's a lot of fiber in it she has a protein powder a little bit of kale olive oil MCT oil and water and this is one of her favorite suppers meatballs with a little marinara sauce spaghetti squash with lots of butter a little bit of Parmesan cheese she's got a sprout salad here MCT oil plus olive oil and vinegar for a dressing and she snacks on almonds so should we be concerned about the types of fat if our diet is mostly fat and I think yes I took this picture last week at my local health food store and I just thought wow we are so spoiled here we have all of these options all of these fats but actually not one of them in the picture is would be something that would recommend to people so I know I have to provide them with advice and which are the the best and it's easiest to tell them first which ones to avoid so I'm probably gonna get hate mail after this from the food industry but these are the facts there are damaged fats deep fried foods hydrogenated oils and those are the ones that have trans fats heating oils to high temperature even olive oil which is an excellent oil if you heat it high your oxidative it not good so you you don't want to heat oils for sauteing very high processed polyunsaturated fats bottled salad dressings most of them are soybean oil imitation cheeses margarine and mayonnaise from soybean oil thankfully there's a couple brands out that are avocado oil our saturated fats okay yes in 2015 our federal government finally admitted that saturated fats don't cause heart disease and you can feel comfortable eating them whoops seed in fruit MCT oils you're hearing about that a lot and I want to show you in this chart these are the saturated fats the in our food supply most of them and these fruit oils and animal fats are highest in saturated fat the monounsaturated which we know are really good for us are in the middle here and these are also great sources Omega of omega-3 and omega-6 we really don't need to be eating these high polyunsaturated fats on especially on a daily basis but these these two here are really the best because they provide all the fats that we need and we can take them in large amounts people are often very worried about omega-3s and six and too much omega-6 can interfere with that omega-3 metabolism and the high highest concentration of DHA and EPA from Omega 3 are quality marine oil such as cod liver or krill so I have mostly adults that are taking this in a pill form to make sure they get it but we can get it from our food sources as well unique oils with micronutrients extra virgin olive oil as I mentioned not only omega-3 but vitamin E k1 ubiquinol this is like medicine this is so good avocado oil also vitamin eighth I am in riboflavin and lecithin and this is more heat stable than olive oil so if you're going to saute eggs or whatever use use avocado oil instead and then superfoods and I have this one out at the table too but I really like to feed people nutrient-dense carbs I've turned a lot of people onto sprouting these are the sprout category here it's very easy to do at home this is like the kitchen garden that is so easy and healthful to do it's wonderful to teach children to do this vitamins and minerals are essential in the diet and this should be individualized a multivitamin supplement that's carb free there's actually several out but you really you really have to watch and look at ingredients and look for quality products minerals I have most of my patients getting calcium some and vitamin D if they're not in a sunny climate like yours vitamin D and some with magnesium children specifically I also provide phosphorus and then most of my patients also need a little bit of electrolyte support and that can be as easy as salting their foods or Morton light salt which I prefer because not only do you get the sodium but there's a little bit of potassium and you get the chloride too so I have people using like a quarter of a teaspoon or at eighth of a teaspoon a day getting getting into their water or putting it on their food it doesn't really matter how they take it in or if they take it in all at once and then other nutritional support these are very individualized based on what's going on gastrointestinal support chia seeds have fiber flax seeds have fiber avocados have not only fiber but magnesium and I've got a lot of people off of their laxatives by just eating avocado regularly sunflower seeds and egg yolk have lecithin and that's helpful in digesting fats and then I've used pancreatic enzymes and people that were pretty sick that that they just needed a little bit of support in order to process the fat in their diet and and stay on the diet and metabolic and cardiac I've not had a lot of experience with exaggerated ketones but that's I know that's on the horizon as being a helpful adjunct to this therapy and then these other supplements and I'm getting the the hook here to speed up my last slide so I do want to emphasize that electrolyte replacement is necessary specifically for exercise during the heat fasting or six days and this is my little recipe I basically took Pedialyte and mimicked it by using salt and water and so you can contact me if you need that recipe otherwise if hopefully you took a snapshot of it but that's also published in our materials at the Charlie foundation be good to your gut because this impacts so much of our immune system and our overall health our liver converts that to ketones so for we're pounding our liver with toxic food and medications it really struggles to help us overcome whatever whatever condition we are trying to recover from the saboteurs are processed foods acid blockers statins and antibiotics and these would have been mentioned a couple times in the past few days and probiotics this is really hot stuff in nutrition you can eat your probiotics you can take a supplement I recommend both but getting a variety and I mentioned kombucha before and I think this is a fantastic probiotic it also has the benefit of having butyric acid which feeds your colon and in super healthy you have to watch out for the carb content so making it at home again this is an easy thing to make at home if you have a little bit of time that your first batch is always the most time and intense but that after that you realize it's quite simple and then food safety a lot of people ask me about endocrine disruptors and carcinogens there's a wonderful website that will educate you about safe foods and and non seeds and so on just in summary I want to acknowledge the Charlie foundation for supporting me and helping to promote their mission which is education and advocacy and Jim who happens to be a Hollywood movie writer and producer wrote this film called first do no harm which is the Hippocratic oath that doctors take and he has brought the ketogenic diet out of the closet and probably is responsible for a lot of the generation of new research this is Charlie here who had been on the diet for five years for epilepsy seizure free he's now 23 he's certified teacher and works with young children is doing fabulously and then finally people were asking about where do you go to get help from a nutritionist the Charlie foundation has vetted about 12 health professionals and some of them are here with me at the table and you can stop by and chat with them afterwards during the dinner in the lunch break I should say and we hope to expand on this thank you very much [Applause]", "pU6gH5-mMD8": "[Music] Thank You Angela and thank you to the organizers having just come off of a big global meeting I really appreciate all that work all the work that goes into this and truly its blood sweat and tears but this is a successful meeting and I did hear Dominic say that you did no advertising so that's a testament to how rapidly this area is growing okay I have no commercial relationships to disclose and I just want to start out by defining ketogenic diet therapy because I helped many of us at work in this light to take the word diet out of there and talk more about the therapy because it it really is a therapy that encompasses several components so on the diet end this is highly simplified but fat is the main source of calories and a lot of people take days weeks and months to digest this mentally and to wrap their heads around it so we talked about it up front and get them used to this concept protein is provided to meet needs I'll come back to that a little bit later and carbohydrate is minimized and this is individualized to specific goals and again I'll come back to this the therapy part is that there is a huge emotional adaption and having been nutritionists for many many years I came upon this diet sort of by default and having worked with all of the therapies in hospital setting renal diets diabetic diets Cystic Fibrosis diets etc there is none that came close to the powerful results that I saw with us and I decided after my first child that this was it for me that I was going to only do this for the rest of my career hydration needs to be part of the therapy I'm gonna come back to that micronutrient supplementation is critical and fasting is something I talk to every single person that I work with but I have to define that because fasting simply means without food so what do we mean for some it might be just going without food for 12 hours which is supposed to be what we're you know all supposed to do we don't eat during the night and 10 or 12 hours is not hard to do some people need longer fasting I fast myself every Monday starting Sunday after dinner so I'll go either 24 or 36 hours so I invite my patients to join me in solidarity and that seems to be very helpful and sometimes we go longer but this is very individualized depending on what goal the therapy has for them and then laboratory studies we do quite a bit in children that have epilepsy which is the first application that I used this therapy for for about 10 years and we did quite a bit of blood work however I know that this is not possible everywhere and I believe that these are the minimum laboratory studies that should be done on anyone for a couple reasons one for safety but also to prevent people from coming off the diet early if something does look abnormal oftentimes there's abnormalities before starting someone on the therapy and they can improve on the diet so I use it you know for safety but also to help keep people on the therapy to prove that they're doing fine so since we're talking so much about science I had to throw this slide in this is how I approach people this is a end of one trial and that simply means that the single patient is the entire trial so again it's a very individualized therapy and I'm gonna give you a two examples from the low end of the spectrum in terms of control to a very controlled therapy so this is pretty typical of a lot of people that I work with that come to me with migraine headache and apparently it's 15% of females that have this disorder about 10% in males and I run into this frequently just in my personal circle of friends and family but this particular woman 32 year old female with migraine headaches for about eight years she was trialed on topiramate which is actually an anti-seizure medication and it made her very dopey so she stopped taking it she was hospitalized twice for dehydration due to nauseant not in vomit from a migraine and if any of you have ever had a migraine it's very debilitating and you just want to die it's just you just feel you know horrible giy she had constipation and endocrine she was moderately obese diet-wise skips breakfast eats convenience foods for lunch but she has a dinner with a family that is usually home-cooked foods so I'm just showing you some of the pertinent details from her her history and her intake and not everything social wise she's a full time graduate student to school age kids her husband is very supportive and she had mentioned to me several times that her life is very very stressful and she's also sedentary so um I asked her to keep a food diary which I knew was gonna be difficult because she hardly had time to go to the bathroom so she said what about if I just send you pictures of what I'm eating and I said that's perfectly fine so you know I asked her for honesty just be honest with me I'm I'm your therapist I'm not here to judge you I'm here to help you so she sent me this is one day of her diet now these are not all of the foods that she ate but these are the ones that I picked out is being problematic and she started her morning with a latte and she thought she was eating a very healthy yogurt for lunch and she'd have a snack in the afternoon of some type of bar and then she always carried a beverage along with her to sip on during the day and then this nice big muffin from Costco and this is just part of her day but right here well over 200 grams of carbohydrate right so this brings me to something that I discuss with everybody at some point in time who eats like this whether they want to try ketogenic or not but are seeking my advice and that's this thing called sugar addiction and it's very real and we all have it even I am sugar addicted even though I don't eat sugar it would be very easy for me to go back to it and I even I am tempted even though I'm in ketosis and my appetite is you know very normalized we all have this and this has been proven in mice and I and I regret not throwing my slide in here citing the study actually was rats but rats were fed or offered a choice between cocaine and sugar and which do they pick they pick sugar so it is you know physiological addiction and once we talk about that and recognize it you know we can embrace this a little bit easier rather than just thinking you know I can eat whatever I want and I like being I like being able to not restrict myself but we put in terms of an addiction and then we start to stay back sit back and say oh my gosh I can't help myself we see people totally getting off of sugar once they go into ketosis and it's not a problem for them anymore this is this is something pretty magical about being in ketosis it just they just have such satiation from all the fat that they're getting but they're not tempted as much some are but we have people that so-called cheat I call that an experiment what did you learn from it when you went and had something that's not cheating and it's an experiment but anyways coming back to this woman with migraine her goal was to eliminate migraines and she used the word desperate I am desperate I is just a mess and I can't imagine living like this so our first plan was not even to talk about ketogenic diet I said let's just clean up your diet and and she was perplexed by that what do you mean clean up my diet I think I eat pretty healthy so I said you know what let's give this like a month and see how you do with cleaning up your diet and I'm going to explain that in a minute and then our plan B will be to go on to a ketogenic diet so she bought into that and this is something that I developed with a Charly foundation is called a Whole Foods diet it's sugar-free and gluten-free and why is it gluten-free well the classic ketogenic diet designed in 1923 is a gluten-free diet people don't refer to it as that but just by nature of the limited carbohydrate we are eliminating greens so it's a gluten-free diet and of course it's sugar-free and we put this together to show people these are the foods on a ketogenic diet it's unlimited in this step you can eat what you want but it teaches you to eat fat so this is just the top half of the for the first page there's four pages of this and we are giving this out at the Charlie Foundation table so you're welcome to to see the rest of it but it starts off with recommending protein and then fat and the carbohydrate is below this and then we go on to explain more in detail a week's worth of our menus and alternatives to pasta and bread and this type of thing but more most importantly it teaches people they have to eat fat with each meal and why is that important I'm gonna come back to it one thing I did want to talk to her about right away is alternatives to what she was doing to help give her some practical guidance she just had to have her caffeine in the morning which is totally fine and pretty common among all of us very evident by the line every morning every midday and every afternoon outside the bulletproof table and I'm at the table right next to them so I've been actually helping them put cups out because the line is so long that nobody can see me so so here we go so I have a coherence my pointer so what can we do instead of a lot of table if you've had their coffee you know it's they're putting butter into to some people like cream in coffee you get a little bit more fat and calories with the butter and it's very low carb what about that yogurt that healthy apparently healthy yogurt that's loaded with sugar there are high fat Greek yogurts and you can put just a little bit of berries in there just a little handful of berries very satisfying why is there so much sugar in this sports bar okay we have recipes for seed crackers chia seeds flax seeds etc and companies are coming out with these products so that they're more convenient this in on the right is kombucha which I'm gonna come back to a little bit later but a very healthy low-carb although some of them have fruit juices add to them but you want to look for the lower carb one I've gotten people off of their laxatives with this I've gotten people off of drinking diet soda all day which I'm gonna come back to later and then what about that muffin again there are products you've had some of them here coming out in the market in the past few years that are great alternatives or people can make these at home there's great recipe book lists and book cookbooks available these days so what about non-food carbohydrates these can be a significant source of carbs for some people I know of people who drink sports beverages like it was water right two or three times two or three bottles of this Gatorade high carb drink and they do make low carb ones that that are fine but watch out for the carb in sports drinks what about medications we have to really watch for this in children because most children's medications are either syrups elixirs or chewable tablets that are sweetened to help get them down these can be significant what happens if you go into the hospital what do they hook up right away an IV with dextrose that's sugar so they can give you an IV without sugar you have to ask for it 20 percent dextrose means there's 20 grams of carbohydrate in a leader so the first thing that I did when I went in to visit a patient in the hospital who had come in urgently for something non non epilepsy related is walk over to the IV bag and make sure there was no dextrous in the IV because that often got overlooked even in the hospital what about sweeteners well sweeteners are 100 percent carbohydrate it doesn't matter how natural they are honey and agave nectar and coconut syrup their carbohydrate questionable sweeteners there's a study just from a few years ago that looked at the microbe quality of the gut after giving mice artificial sweeteners and it not only altered the microbiota but they found that it affected glucose tolerance so that's done in mice there are studies coming out soon in adults showing what happens with artificial sweeteners and also what happens on ketogenic therapy I can't wait for that one to come out but the other point is that when you're in ketosis it alters your taste buds and it magnifies the acute knee of acuity of sweetness so I can eat something and say oh my gosh that's so sweet and my husband can eat the same thing and say this is really bland okay we don't need the sweetening in foods once we're in ketosis okay coming back to this woman with migraines after nine months she was migraine free she was spilling trace in small ketones in her urine our goal was not to go into heat ptosis but what was happening is that she was burning her own body fat and that was contributing to ketones she lost 15 pounds that wasn't what we focused on but it inherently happened and when we talk about calorie restriction people think about how do I have to count my calories and no we don't count but when you are when you eat a whole foods diet you automatically are calorie restricting it just happens because you don't overeat especially when you're incorporating fat so this is wonderful that I don't have to explain you're on a calorie restricted diet you just don't know what you can eat as much of these lower carb vegetables as you want stay within the fat limits that I've advised but pretty much they can fill up and they feel very satisfied and they don't overeat so it's a caloric restriction by design not by intent she also reported that she wasn't as hungry as before she was going three or four hours and skipping snacks right so this is a culture here where we graze all day long we have food available everywhere we turn and she was passing up the treats and there alone was some caloric restriction over what she had previously been doing her cholesterol and LDL went up and if any of you listen to David diamond you know that this is not something to be concerned about it went up because she was losing weight and she was breaking down fat so it was mobilizing the cholesterol in her body it eventually came down about nine months out we saw it normalize she got off of her commercial laxatives which is something I spent lots of time talking to people about and telling them I'm gonna ask you about your bowel habits you're just gonna have to get used to it but it's very important to know that you are having a bowel movement if not every day then every other day okay so the plan was let's just continue this Whole Foods diet making sure she's getting about three tablespoons of fat with each meal which I figured it was about 50% of her calories and this is at 50% is barely ketosis but again she has some more fat to lose and we aren't focusing on weight loss that wasn't one of her goals but we we know that that's just a benefit of of her eating this way case history number two is somebody with epilepsy this is a 13 year old girl with intractable epilepsy that means seizures that are resistant to standard therapy she was trialed on seven different anti epileptic drugs and currently was on CBD oil which is cannabidiol oil from hemp and she the the drugs not only didn't help her seizures she was suffering some from adverse side effects of the drugs with the oil she was not suffering any side effects and she had months of pretty good seizure control but then started to fall apart the family had been trying a modified Adkins diet on their own there's a lot of information on the internet so they were doing this on their own but I had them check her glucose and report it to me in the morning and I was a little suspicious that it was it's normal but at the high end of normal especially for a young person and her ketones were trace so they you know they've made great attempts to follow what they thought was a ketogenic diet but just needed some help structuring that a little bit more if she was at her ideal body weight she was also doing gluten-free and the eldest of two children active when she's not having seizures and she verbalized that she would do anything to control her seizures she just knew that her life was a mess and so for this family I gave them again at Charlie Foundation publication to show them the different ketogenic therapies that are in the literature and so the therapy the four different therapies that have been published pretty extensively are at the top and this is the classic ketogenic diet and the MCT oil dye both designed in the 1920s I also have this out at the table if anybody wants a copy low glycemic index treatment this is a hybrid ketogenic diet and then modified Atkins another hybrid diet so the first three rows you see they're all yeses is that medically supervised is that high in fat is it low in carbohydrate this is what they have in common and then we start to see the logistics differ quite a bit as we go down what is the ratio of fat to carbohydrate protein in the classic ketogenic diet week we can actually modulate it because it's so structured we can modulate it to any ratio the MCT oil diet is about a 1 to 1 and the low glycemic index is also about a 1 to 1 and modified Atkins is a little higher about a 2 to 1 how much carbohydrate would be allowed on a thousand calories excuse me it's pushing too hard here on a thousand calories you can see the 4 to 1 is the most strict in carb 3 - 116 - to 130 and 40 to 60 on a 1 to 1 the MCT oil diet between 40 and 50 local ice emic between 40 and 60 and these dependent no matter how many calories this is the carbohydrate restriction and then modified Atkins the stipulation is who you start off with about 10 grams for adolescents or 15 grams for adults for about a month and then you liberalize it to about 20 grams and then again this is very individualized these are just like starting places for all of these there are peas how our foods measured and these - structured diets are either weighed or measured and in household measuring cups tablespoons teaspoons low glycemic measured or estimated and modified is just estimated our meal plans use yes and for modified Kent Atkins it's optional where's the diet started these are tend to be started in the hospital although as a private practice nutritionist I work with people at home I just start them out much more gradually than we would in a hospital where we would start quickly and we would wrap rapidly initiate them to get them home before the kid starts getting picky but I've done this safely and at long distances people on the other side of the world very gradually over weeks and even months and it's quite safe and these two are meant to be done at home our calories controlled yes on these first three no unmodified Atkins our vitamin and mineral supplements use yes across the board our fluids restricted no across-the-board this is a myth from long ago that you restrict fluids and it related to the degree of ketosis in the urine and now we have a much more sophisticated methods of checking for ketones that besides urine and so urine if you don't drink very much your ketones getting very strong because your urine is concentrated we want people to drink on these therapies because the ketosis has a very strong diuretic effect that means you lose fluid very easily and so you need to replace that by drinking is our pre diet laboratory evaluations that required yes across-the-board and can there be side effects yes across-the-board so there's actually a lot more similarities in all these therapies and there are differences it's just the logistics of teaching and managing and again as I said before we may start somebody off very liberal and move them over to more structured diets and we tend to start children off on a very structured diet and then liberalize them to get them off or to maintain them and then we can move around between diets so common element of care is taking this MCT oil diet and using that MCT oil in these other three therapies so experienced ketogenic nutritionists don't focus in on one specific diet other than to get it started and then work with the individual for tolerance and how they emotionally are adapting and then adjust it over time so there's lots of flexibility and then people with feeding tubes we tend to use a very structured diet and that's one of my specialties I work with individuals that aren't able to eat orally and have feeding tubes so we can blend up Whole Foods just like anybody would be eating and put them down a feeding tube and there's there's commercial products available too so there's lots of options so going back to the second case history her goal was to eliminate seizures and we wanted to start with a structured ketogenic diet so she she wasn't very active at the time although she got more active so we usually start off with a base like goal calories for sedentary and then add ketogenic snacks to make up for the activity for the calories for an inactivity and they can double the snack or leave the snack out on a day that they're not active 164 grams of fat 62 grams of protein this is about a gram per kilogram and I can show you fancy predictive equations for calculating protein this is something that nutritionists love to get into and talk about and argue about but it's I can simplify that by saying we want to meet their protein needs we can go as low as about point six grams per kilogram and I've gone up as high as two grams per kilo so it's very individual and the more active somebody it is the more calories they're gonna take in and they're more room for them to eat more protein but one of them the mistakes I see commonly with people trying to do this on their own is that they're taking in too much protein because they have this idea that protein does not affect their glucose level so I'll come back to that in a moment to will excuse me she is 20 grams of carbohydrate per day which is what they were trying to do on their own and then I had her monitor not only her glucose level but her blood level of ketones and Patricia is gonna go into more about monitoring so I'm not gonna belabor that point the hydration is really important it's actually the first thing I teach somebody when we're talking about a ketogenic therapy that they have to be vigil about drinking every day and once they get into that routine it's second nature but why why dehydration causes your heart to pump faster right water carries red blood cells with oxygen to cells if you feel like you're getting sleepy sitting here for a couple hours drink and you'll brighten up a little bit right and then water removes toxins from waste and from the from waste products from the blood and sufficient hydration can prevent constipation and kidney stones and the incidence of kidney stones actually on the ketogenic diet is no higher than it is for somebody just on a regular diet but because it's been reported and we know that it can occur if you're not drinking enough and I've only seen it in people that are taking drugs that also cause kidney stones and there's a couple of anti epileptic drugs that can cause kidney stones so sometimes they are passing a kidney stone because I told them to start drinking once we get into the diet and those kidney stones have been sitting there for a while now we're moving them out so we pay attention to people that are complaining about pain during urination and get them checked out right away especially if they were on the medications that can cause kidney stones so you've seen the slide several times from other speakers I just want to remind you that you can get ketones through fasting this is actually how the diet was invented many years ago and fat cells break down into fatty acids and convert to ketones in the liver and those enter into the bloodstream so again we can check the ketones in the blood we can check them crudely in the urine and now we can also check them by exhaled breath so the ketogenic diet mimics fasting fat is the main source of calories and I'm going to talk a little bit more about different types of fat but the classic diet was actually based on mostly dairy fat butter and heavy cream heavy whipping cream now we've kind of modernized it by introducing monounsaturated fats and and saturated fats like coconut oil and MCT oil carbohydrate is limited and if I could feed everybody that I work with I would feed them vegetables for their source of carbs now not everybody is that pure istic about it but they realize soon they get more volume if they eat the lowest carbohydrate vegetables so I also try to introduce them to rhubarb which is a vegetable but we think of it as a fruit and how satisfying that can be and you can usually get this year-round in freezers in the grocery store so this is this has opened up lots of recipes for people that I work with with either making it into smoothies or cooking it down and adding it to they're on their low-carb crackers as like a jelly and then berries because berries are the highest phytonutrient and highest fiber fruit and they are fairly low in carbohydrate compared to other fruit and then protein we try to encourage whole food sources although things like bacon and sausage can work into the diet just as well so I want to step back again and talk a little bit about how those macronutrients affect glucose levels and I'm using a red line here to represent simple sugars so when you eat that hard candy on the table back there what happens is your glucose spikes up right if we had hard candy on our table at the banth meeting and I contacted the banquet manager and I said please go around and remove those from the table because they just put them out there they don't ask you right and so we don't think about this this is just part of our culture but this is what happens your glucose Rises quickly and then it falls within about an hour and then we have complex carbohydrates so fruits and whole grains and it also rises and not as high and comes down and then you consume protein protein actually if you add it to carbohydrate it slows down the curve but then some protein it's converted to glucose right so then it eventually rises and fat which doesn't have a glycemic index at all it doesn't raise your glucose but if you add it to this mix it actually lowers that Fleiss emic index it lowers that effect so what happens with a ketogenic therapy well we eliminate sugar okay and if you experiment with your diet and eat sugar you're going to find that it's going to knock you out of ketosis so you learn quickly that that's not a good experiment to repeat all right carbohydrate we reduce significantly protein for most people as far less than what they had been eating they don't realize that not just the chicken and the fish have protein but vegetables have protein too and it can be significant depending on which you pick and most people are eating more than they really need so we're bringing that down and then fat is the main source of calories so that lowers the glycemic index and this is a glycemic curve in a child I worked with children solely for about 10 years and their glucose levels no matter what ketogenic the ratio we had them on ranged between 55 and 75 and that was one of our ways to know if they were compliant and it didn't matter what time of day you checked it was rocks table with adults I see it's between 10 and 20 points higher and that's just the nature of the beast so macronutrients interplay and one affects the other protein as you know is essential for tissue maintenance and tissue growth particularly in children and sorry here I'm snap happy here carbohydrate feeds the glycolysis pathway but so does proteins some proteins are glycolytic so they'll feed into this glycolytic pathway a lot of people don't realize fat which biochemically is triglycerides is composed of a glycerol molecule plus three fatty acids so when those split apart the glycerol feeds the glycolytic pathway and this is what's supporting glucose in the blood when we're not eating hard okay so one of the mistakes I see people make a lot is if we are getting low glucose below nor all below that low-normal that we see with ketogenic they automatically want to give somebody more carbohydrate and typically it's not that they need more carbohydrates just they need more calories and most of that is going to be from fat so the second child as I mentioned earlier we wanted to provide a structured ketogenic diet and this is a snapshot from a keto diet calculator again funded by the Charlie foundation and she is able to create meals she or her parents and I actually start started them out by designing some meals for her based on the goal of protein fat and carbohydrate and she her goals per meal are at the bottom this is a two to one ratio 600 calories this is one of her three meals she's her meals are eight or her diet is 1800 calories a day so we don't talk in terms of breakfast lunch and supper we just talk about meals because they're all interchangeable and they're able to fluctuate if they want more protein in a meal and less carbohydrate they can do that we just don't want them cheating out in the proton the protein so this is a very structured very organized way for them to get on track with weighing foods and measuring them and most people this H teenagers are capable of doing this for a while and then they get the intuitive sense of the amounts and they can put the scale away okay and that usually takes between one and three months of being on therapy and sometimes they come back to the scale of things go out off the rocker so this is what our our plan was with her and I keep showing you this picture in the background this is one of her favorite meals it's it's I'll show and and that's what you saw in the calculation this is simply fish and this is a avvocato mayonnaise with a little bit of lemon juice and Parmesan cheese and you just broil it you put the sauce over the top and broil it and it's truly delicious and it just takes a few minutes and then she's got all this broccoli here to go with it so she was very compliant to this 82% fat diet her seizures didn't until about two weeks and this is quite typical with with epilepsy we don't see changes often times right away in fact we sit just waiting three months to see a change but three months later she's helping to prepare her own meals and seizure control continues to improve she's still having seizures but not nearly as many she's going back to school she's starting to rejoin her activity and this is another typical day I asked her what she what her favorite meals are and she like many teenage girls tends to want vegetarian meals that's a big thing in this age group so they don't really like to eat much meat so here's a hemp hearts porridge with chia seeds and hemp hearts are very high in protein so they work really well with us she's got we've encouraged her doing a tablespoon of MCT oil with each meal to help ketosis and this is a blender meal she likes doing this the night before and freezing it and taking it to school she's got rhubarb a cup is about three grams of carbohydrate so it's quite low there's a lot of fiber in it she has a protein powder a little bit of kale olive oil MCT oil and water and this is one of her favorite suppers meatballs with a little marinara sauce spaghetti squash with lots of butter a little bit of Parmesan cheese she's got a sprout salad here MCT oil plus olive oil and vinegar for a dressing and she snacks on almonds so should we be concerned about the types of fat if our diet is mostly fat and I think yes I took this picture last week at my local health food store and I just thought wow we are so spoiled here we have all of these options all of these fats but actually not one of them in the picture is would be something that would recommend to people so I know I have to provide them with advice and which are the the best and it's easiest to tell them first which ones to avoid so I'm probably gonna get hate mail after this from the food industry but these are the facts there are damaged fats deep fried foods hydrogenated oils and those are the ones that have trans fats heating oils to high temperature even olive oil which is an excellent oil if you heat it high your oxidative it not good so you you don't want to heat oils for sauteing very high processed polyunsaturated fats bottled salad dressings most of them are soybean oil imitation cheeses margarine and mayonnaise from soybean oil thankfully there's a couple brands out that are avocado oil our saturated fats okay yes in 2015 our federal government finally admitted that saturated fats don't cause heart disease and you can feel comfortable eating them woops seed in fruit MCT oils you're hearing about that a lot and i want to show you in this chart these are the saturated fats the in our food supply most of them and these fruit oils and animal fats are highest in saturated fat the monounsaturated which we know are really good for us are in the middle here and these are also great sources Omega of omega-3 and omega-6 we really don't need to be eating these high polyunsaturated fats on especially on a daily basis but these the these two here are really the best because they provide all the fats that we need and we can take them in large amounts people are often very worried about omega-3s and six and too much omega-6 can interfere with that omega-3 metabolism and the high highest concentration of DHA and EPA from Omega 3 are quality marine oil such as cod liver or krill so I have mostly adults that are taking this in a pill form to make sure they get it but we can get it from our food sources as well unique oils with micronutrients extra virgin olive oil as I mentioned not only omega-3 but vitamin E k1 ubiquinol this is like medicine this is so good for us picado oil also vitamin 8th i am in riboflavin and lecithin and this is more heat stable than olive oil so if you're going to saute eggs or whatever use use avocado oil instead and then superfoods and I have this one out at the table too but I really like to feed people nutrient-dense carbs I've turned a lot of people onto sprouting these are the sprout category here it's very easy to do at home this is like the kitchen garden that is so easy and healthful to do it's wonderful to teach children to do this vitamins and minerals are essential in the diet and this should be individualized a multivitamin supplement that's carb free there's actually several out but you really you really have to watch and look at ingredients and look for quality products minerals I have most of my patients getting calcium some and vitamin D if they're not in a sunny climate like yours vitamin D and some with magnesium children specifically I also provide phosphorus and then most of my patients also need a little bit of electrolyte support and that can be as easy as salting their foods or Morton light salt which I prefer because not only do you get the sodium but there's a little bit of potassium and you get the chloride too so I have people using like a quarter of a teaspoon or at eighth of a teaspoon a day getting getting into their water or putting it on their food it doesn't really matter how they take it in or if they take it in all at once and then other nutritional support these are very individualized based on what's going on gastrointestinal support chia seeds have fiber flax seeds have fiber avocados have not only fiber but magnesium and I've got a lot of people off of their laxatives by just eating avocado regularly sunflower seeds and egg yolk have lecithin and that's helpful in digesting fats and then I've used pancreatic enzymes and people that were pretty sick that that they just needed a little bit of support in order to process the fat in their diet and and stay on the diet and metabolic and cardiac I've not had a lot of experience with exaggerated ketones but that's I know that's on the horizon as being a helpful adjunct to this therapy and then these other supplements and I'm getting the the hook here to speed up my last slide so I do want to emphasize that electrolyte replacement is necessary specifically for exercise during the heat fasting or six days and this is my little recipe I basically took Pedialyte and mimicked it by using salt and water and so you can contact me if you need that recipe otherwise if hopefully you took a snapshot of it but that's also published in our materials at the Charlie foundation be good to your gut because this impacts so much of our immune system and our overall health our liver converts that to ketones so for we're pounding our liver with toxic food and medications it really struggles to help us overcome whatever whatever condition we are trying to recover from the saboteurs are processed foods acid blockers statins and antibiotics and these would have been mentioned a couple times in the past few days and probiotics this is really hot stuff and nutrition you can eat your probiotics you can take a supplement I recommend both but getting a variety and I mentioned kombucha before and I think this is a fantastic probiotic it also has the benefit of having butyric acid which feeds your colon and in super healthy you have to watch out for the carb content so making it at home again this is an easy thing to make at home if you have a little bit of time that your first batch is always the most time and intense but that after that you realize it's quite simple and then food safety a lot of people ask me about endocrine disruptors and carcinogens there's a wonderful website that will educate you about safe foods and and non seeds and so on just in summary I want to acknowledge the Charlie foundation for supporting me and helping to promote their mission which is education and advocacy and Jim who happens to be a Hollywood movie writer and producer wrote this film called first do no harm which is the Hippocratic oath that doctors take and he has brought the ketogenic diet out of the closet and probably is responsible for a lot of the generation of new research this is Charlie here who had been on the diet for five years for epilepsy seizure free he's now 23 he's certified teacher and works with young children is doing fabulously and then finally people were asking about where do you go to get help from a nutritionist the Charlie foundation has vetted about 12 health professionals and some of them are here with me at the table and you can stop by and chat with them afterwards during the dinner in the lunch break I should say and we hope to expand on this thank you very much [Applause]", "Uiin30BkHOU": "pork is cruelty to pigs the price we have to pay for ham sandwiches or is there another way is important pork reared on a diet of artificial hormones of powerful antibiotics and do the nitrites and ham and bacon cause stomach cancer what's really in our core we eat a lot of pork each year about 63,000 tons of it that's over 700 thousand of these piggies but in recent years pork has suffered a bit of a bad reputation mostly due to publicity about conditions in our piggeries I'm gonna find out more about those later but first what's good about pork [Music] just like any other kind of meat pork is an excellent source of high-quality protein it contains a lot of vitamin b1 and useful amounts of selenium along with other beneficial vitamins and minerals in the 1980's America's National Pork Board began marketing pork as a white meat as red meat had been linked to heart disease and cancer for the other way needle but was the advertising actually one big porky pie well iron is what makes red meat red and pork has less than either beef or lamb and about the same as chicken so using this criterion it seems that pork really is white meat fresh pork only has one ingredient but the most popular pork products ham and bacon have a surprising number of added ingredients some hams are only a little over half actual pork meat can be replaced by fillers like soy or potato starch but the second ingredient in most hams and many Bacon's is this water water is added to bacon and ham as a result of the curing process but some evaporates during secondary processing for instance if the bacon is smoked so just how much water are we paying for turns out that manufacturers are under no legal obligation to tell us so we sent an assortment of bacon to the lab the least was in Hutton's at 57% whereas almost 71 percent of the helis bacon was water this may seem surprisingly high but actually a fresh leg of pork is around 76 percent water after water the next most common ingredients in hammond bacon is the preservative it's laden with the stuff but don't be scared it's only salt to demonstrate why this one simple ingredient has been used to preserve meat for hundreds of years with given food scientists oh and young two legs of pork he'll leave one untreated but soak the other and brine for five days - salt cure it so five days are up we're gonna take a salted leg of pork out and you can see it changed a lot of color here and now hang this for two weeks along with the unsalted one and a cool room so our two weeks are we're gonna to leg support here we're gonna salt a bun which is over here that smells okay this guy it's rank it really is rank okay so here's how you view light now this will show up bugs that actually flew arrest you can see this sort of yellowy stuff these are shooter manners they for the risk quite nicely there's other orange stuff you can see from time to time black stuff like over although this is a mess we also sent swabs off to the lab for more scientific analysis the swab from the untreated pork had a whopping four million bacteria on it compared to just 5600 on the salted pork so salt is a fantastic preservative but unfortunately the sodium it contains can cause high blood pressure and heart disease and because of the curing process ham contains around 16 times as much and bacon more than 12 times as much as uncured pork so eat both in moderation to look after your heart we used to sing cows and sheep in the paddocks but where exactly are all the pigs we're eating conventional farms can be indoor outdoor or a mix largely depending on the local environment 59% our indoor it's easier to control temperature sam McIver of New Zealand pork has agreed to show me around a typical farm life for pigs differs from farm to farm and most conventional ones that begins in one of these are farrowing crate the whole design here is about keeping the sound from rolling on the piglets the aim for the pig farmers to grow as many pigs as they possibly can and obviously they don't want pigs dying around 60% of all sales in New Zealand are confined in farrowing crates for up to 5 weeks until their piglets are weaned farrowing crates roughly have the number of piglet deaths during weaning but the mortality rate is still around 12% the SPCA wants them banned saying restricting a pig's movement for long periods can lead to demented behavior New Zealand pork says they're looking to make improvements but there are no plans to raise them out so you're a parent I'm a parent does anything about this operation strike he was perhaps a little bit cruel absolutely not these sounds are very happy they're doing what they naturally are do which as they eat and they lie down and feed their pigs so what does life hold in store for the piglets once they're weaned well as opposed to their mothers which breed until they're about four years old most piglets live for around four months of the slaughter some are raised in eco baths where they're relatively free to roam and some will be finished off in concrete pens like these what do you think of the way things are here for them they're good I mean these these pigs you can see they're very very healthy they grow well and it is about providing a good environment for the animal to grow and to make efficient use of your feed at Citroen cetera the farmer goes out of business then nobody's one out of that situation coming up I'll investigate the most controversial pig farming practice it's against our animal welfare legislation and what to look out for if you want to buy pork made from free roaming pig I found out around 60% of sales in New Zealand are confined in farrowing crates for up to five weeks at a time a practice the SPCA wants banned around 35% of sales will also spend some or all of their four month pregnancy and what's known as a gestation or sows tool this is by far the most controversial aspect of indoor pig farming but when we asked to film sow stalls an action a New Zealand pork representative explained that pig farmers had been burnt by recent publicity and were unlikely to let our cameras in however we did manage to find a disused piggery which reveals the conditions some pigs are raised in on intensive pig farms it's almost upsetting being in here there would be more than 200 pigs and here the noise was deafening you wouldn't come in here without a mouse but the most upsetting part of it for me and I wasn't prepared for feeling the way I am but as is right here where I'm standing I'm standing in a sale store when a pig was pregnant she would come here she'd spend the duration of her pregnancy right here in this very small space food down one running trough at the end and waste matter just going into the grace where I'm standing some cells are continually moved between South stall farrowing crates and mating facility they can live almost their whole lives and confinement so extreme they are unable to turn around but this is already changing and by next year farmers will only be allowed to use sow stalls for 4 weeks of the sales pregnancy and in 2015 will join other world leaders the UK Sweden and Finland by banning them altogether why do you think that's a good idea to face them out I think it's about that is about responding to consumer needs and in the other thing too is that farmers are now confident that there are new options out there that they can use and still maintain pregnancies prevent losses still be able to look out for this as well no sales tools are used at this farm they are experimenting with what's known as group housing with these systems we are learning things and that takes time there is a cost associated with the changeover and that takes time for farmers as well for me this is a huge improvement on intensive farming and there are farms which some consider or humane still only a miniscule 1% of New Zealand pork is truly free ranged that means both the breeding sales and the piglets destined for our tables can run around outside the harmony pork brand some smaller producers and all certified organic farmers fall into this category so if that's free-range pork how does free-farmed pork differ freedom Farms branded pork is produced from piglets born on free-range breeding farms and finished in eco bags they call this free fund free farming and free-range farming for us it's irrelevant the point is we're looking for a product that can be guaranteed to be fun without cruelty and the animals can display their natural behavioral patterns but why is it so much more expensive to bring home the free farmed or free-range bacon when we checked the local supermarkets harmony and freedom farm bacon were significantly dearer than conventionally farmed products the extra costs come about from having to have straw having to have more land the productivity isn't as great and the animals when they run around and move don't put on the same amount of weight for the same amount of feed etc but the reality is consumers will pay it the SPCA supports free-range pig farms but free-farmed pork farms like this one also get the SPCA bluetick so rather than tell me what we're seeing here well this is what you won't see in tents are farming the piglets are actually free to roam the mums are together and sometimes they have some singly and the piglets can chase after them but a milk on the run you can see here that there are a lot of sales over this area but nobody's interfering with anybody else in there's no aggression that's being shown these proud mums have just given birth in their huts on intensive farms they'd be in the indoor farrowing crates I saw earlier it's horrible and industry sees that they can't find an alternative well this is the alternative it is true that more piglets are squashed on free rein farms but according to the SPCA these pigs are free to exhibit natural behavior in a way that's impossible on an intensive farm the SPCA is one of several animal welfare groups calling for farrowing crates along with sales tools to be banned on the grounds of cruelty and the thing that is the most shocking is that it's actually against our animal welfare legislation and that pig farming had to get a dispensation to be able to do that and the dispensation was principally about money as a consumer it's very hard to know whether most pork has been farmed in a way you're comfortable with maybe you'll find with this but not this fine with this but not this unfortunately most labeling won't tell you exactly how your pork was farmed there are brands that now display New Zealand pork spec care label but some are critical basically it's really unhelpful because all it means is that the product meets minimum requirements under the animal welfare code which still allows pigs to be kept in South doors or farrowing crates in fact currently the only way to be certain pork has been farmed without farrowing crates or sales tools is to opt for one of the few New Zealand brands displaying organic certification or the SPCA's BlueTEC however New Zealand pork says buying pig care label pork supports the tremendous strides this country is making with pig welfare something that can't be guaranteed when buying imported pork nearly 45 percent of the pork we eat around 30,000 tonnes a year is imported so how is this farmed well we import over 80% of our pork from Canada Australia the United States and Denmark all of which allow the use of sow stalls some of us might want to vote with our wallets and avoid pork from these countries but there's a snag a New Zealand brand doesn't guarantee that your by New Zealand pork some products will say made from local and imported ingredients so that's a pretty meaningless claim you could be eating Danish pork preserved with New Zealand salt consumer would like to see mandatory country of origin labeling on all single ingredient foods so for example fish meat such as pork this time consumer and the pork industry see eye to eye we know country of origin labeling as an issue for consumers so way over 90 percent of consumers want to know where the meat is coming from so we think it's absolutely about being transparent and giving consumers the choice after the break on investigative free-roaming pigs make for better tasting pork and could eating too much ham give you stomach cancer I found out much of the pork we eat is produced using sow stalls and farrowing crates which keep sales and conditions which many feel are cruel free-range and free-farmed pork on the other hand our SPCA approved but does a free roaming Pig make for better tasting pork I'm going to find out we had a chef prepare and cook several conventionally produced and free-farmed pork chops the same way [Music] so which will a bunch of meat-loving boxers prefer the red book on the left is conventionally produced while the yellow pork on the right is free found at the red tree I felt the retry was better I ain't slightly preferred the other red one so our boxers awarded an arrow points victory to the conventionally farmed pork although they clearly found a little difference between the two in terms of taste is there a difference in terms of their nutritional value well lab testing revealed both types are very similar protein water salt and energy content however it's farmed one concern many have about pork is fat I'm on the hunt for some knowledgeable meat eaters I have loins of beef pork and lamb but which is the fattiest speed pork or lamb so the beef pork rub is still the fattiest yy4 i suppose it's just the way the animal is fashioned up cookbook a little pork you think Paul yeah why's there so much fat on it the leanest cut is the pork and in the beef the lamb is the fishiest we surprised oh is it yeah other poo-poos the most it is wow that's great that's cuz I love poor I never knew that but it looks patella don't be surprised yeah is it gonna change the way you eat no a lean pork loin shop actually has less fat than similar cuts of beef and lamb that said the fat content of pork depends a lot on the cut trim pork is very low in fat streaky bacon is certainly not we've become so far removed from the farm how many of us even know where our meat comes from Peggy Sam here is going to help me find out we've got five cuts of pork fill it chops mince ham and bacon do you think your pork comes from stick them on mince have no idea I'm sorry ham rolls probably gonna come from a big fellow in fact overall most people we asked made a right pig's ear of it do you eat a lot of pork no okay the Moose is usually from around here the pork chop around the back well bacon goes right here sandwich ham right here and then the Philip on the side so I guess we don't know that much when it comes to pork do you sort of know about where meat comes from Oh roughly but not as well and to complicate this question further some cuts of meat are likely to come from specific varieties of pig bacon pigs for example have been bred to be tubby err for more succulent fatty meat whereas pigs bred for trim pork are far well trimmer but purpose breeding isn't the only way to produce leaner meat farmers in some countries add hormones about 20% of all the pork we eat comes from Australia and around a third of this is produced using the growth hormone PST pigs raised using PST yield more meat which is less fatty although it's licensed in New Zealand our farmers have voluntarily decided not to use it so should we be concerned about PST and pork imported from Aussie I've hopped the ditch to find out it has a zero withholding period that means you can inject it and you can take the pig directly to slaughter there is absolutely no health consequences see when I hear the word hormones I'm thinking of things like testosterone and estrogen is that the kind of hormones we're talking about here PST is not like that it is not a not a steroid hormone at all it's derived from a natural protein that occurs in the animal has no effect on humans we checked this out with the World Health Organization and it's true only minut quantities of PST are used and because it's a protein any that makes it into your stomach would be digested along with the meat but there's another kind of growth promoter that's even more controversial over half the pork we import comes from the USA and Canada intensively farmed pigs in both countries can be reared on a constant diet of antibiotics to promote weight gain antibiotics are not used to increase meat yield in New Zealand or Australia but Ozzy pigs may be fed a constant diet of antibiotics to prevent disease so it really does depend on the individual farm on the disease problems that they've got but there are cases where you know there will be quite continuous use of antibiotics in difficult situations there are other cases where they'll be very very low volumes used but many experts say the amount of antibiotics currently used in farming could have devastating consequences when you use antibiotics resistance can develop and the more you use the more resistance that develops we all have bacteria that sometimes make us sick and we have antibiotics or drugs that kill them the problem with resistance that means that that bug is no longer killed by the drug we're using the antibiotic it's sort of like they put on a bulletproof vest so that the antibiotics that work before no longer work proper cooking will kill superbugs but they can spread from fresh meat at the moment New Zealand and Australian pork I'm not believed to contain superbugs but this is far from true internationally we know around the world from various foods that are sampled in Canada the US but particularly in developing countries that huge percentages of the food has superbugs in it so we need to make sure that if any of those foods are ever imported they are either inactivated by appropriate cooking and storage and/or are tested to make sure they don't have super bugs in them until very recently almost all pork imported into New Zealand had to be cooked or cured which would kill antibiotic resistant superbugs but the government has just announced its intention to allow fresh pork imports and MAF told us it's of the view that the most appropriate way to manage the risk of antimicrobial resistance is through appropriate application and control of antibiotics use in the country of origin so there are no plans to test pork imports for superbugs at the border at the moment we have a head in the sand view if we don't look we don't know therefore there's not a problem nitrous aka e250 is found in most ham and bacon products it protects us against food poisoning and also makes pork look Pinker many people are concerned that nitrites could cause stomach cancer Math Food Safety says there is not enough data to draw firm conclusions but they're not convinced there is a link they've set the safe daily intake of nitrate for an average 70 kilogram adult of 5 milligrams per day that means you'd have to eat 25 kilos of ham to exceed the limit if you're still concerned research suggests vitamin C prevents nitrates from becoming carcinogenic so throw some tomato into your bacon sandwich or better yet you could opt for a bacon that's nitrate free unfortunately if you're a ham lover there's no such option removing the nitrates would mean a big reduction in shelf life so what have I learned well pork can be a great low fat source of protein I don't have to worry about nitrites and ham and bacon as much as I thought if I buy a New Zealand pork I know at three of superbugs and hormones but I was genuinely shocked by the conditions some pigs live in on intensive farms so I guess in the end it's a choice between my heart and my wallet I'm definitely more comfortable with SPCA approved pork so I'm going with my heart [Music]", "X2XhFu5fJ7A": "hello why did i stop using this spirulina and why did i allow this spirulina to expire on me and why should you stop using spirulina straight away the answer is coming up shortly see you in a couple of seconds now for today's 2020 idea to better help please welcome on stage dr joe welcome back i'm dr joe of the doctorjo.com so um i'm going to tell you in this video why i stopped using spirulina products and why you should discontinue using spirulina yourself as well now what i'm about to say here has nothing to do with this brand of spirulina it's got nothing to do with the brand it's about spirulina across the board okay so i just want to make that clear it's not about brands now i'll tell you my story spirit dinner i got into using spirulina some time ago uh because i wanted to introduce some algae into my diet and spirulina looked to be a good fit because it had high magnesium levels and it was also purported to be a decent plant source of vitamin b12 so what's not to like so i started using it i was applying it to my oatmeal to my smoothies and all the rest of it and everything was going well but i wanted to dig deeper into the cellular benefits of actually consuming spirulina so i dug deeper into the science and what i found was shocking so what did i find well uh the so-called vitamin b12 that spirulina is purported to have turned out to be a pseudo vitamin b12 not the real vitamin b12 so the vitamin b12 in spirulina is a vitamin b12 analog not the real vitamin b12 so that was shocking to me because um i wasn't expecting that now you might say what does that mean it is an analog and that means it's a competitor but more importantly the pseudo vitamin b12 in spirulina has no effect on the human body none at all okay none at all so you might be consuming it and it does nothing for you as far as vitamin b12 uh protection is concerned nothing now what makes it worse is that it actually competes with uh the vitamin b12 from other food sources or even from your supplements um so let me just show you graphically what competition actually means so here is what competition actually means so um in here you know this is my graphics no expense pad graphics um so um it does a trick i know it's cheap but it does a trick so if if you assume that this is a cell okay and that's the nucleus of the cell and then you see these little pits here these are receptor sites okay we see this as receptor sites so uh here's what happens uh with the pseudo vitamin b12 and the real version between so if you imagine that these are uh vitamin b12 molecules okay the red ones are the pseudo vitamin b12 okay so pseudo vitamin b12 these are the red ones okay and the green ones are the real vitamin b12 okay so these are the real vitamin b12 now these are the receptor sites you know on the cell surface and so essentially all of these need to compete to get into the cell okay for the cell to utilize the vitamin b12 so what happens now what happens is that they need to attach themselves okay these uh vitamin b12 molecules body pseudo and the and the real version between they need to attach themselves to these receptor sites okay so uh let's see what happens uh when when competition is there competition is not always a good thing sometimes a good thing but not always so here's what happens now this is the same cell okay now we've got uh these uh b12 molecules now attached to the receptor sites and what you see here okay this is the same cell that's the nucleus of the cell um now what you see here is that the pseudo vitamin b12 they've taken up you know they're five receptor sites so the pseudo vitamin b12 they're taking up four of the five receptor sites and leaving one minute school one for the real version b12 so this is how competition in this instance becomes a bad thing because uh the pseudo vitamin b12 they has no effect has no vitamin effect in the human body but is there uh there to to block the rivers and b12 from getting absorbed at the level of the intestine and also in other tissues it stops it from getting attached to the receptor sites in other tissues so you end up with having you know enough consuming enough vitamin real vitamin b12 but the pseudo vitamin b12 have taken over all the receptor sites and then that stops the real vitamin b12 from doing his uh his proper job okay because uh there are no receptor sites left for the real version b12 to attach itself to so this is this is a concept uh regarding uh you know competition when it comes to uh biological molecules okay sometimes uh competition is a good thing uh like in in case of treatment of breast cancer but after that times it is bad in this instance with spirulina it is a bad thing so as you can see there the competition for receptor sites means that uh the pseudo-fat and b12 in spirulina blocks the real vitamin b12 from doing its job because it gets it has to bind and bond to the same molecules that transport the real vitamin b12 so um it is a problem uh because you might be consuming uh vitamin b12 from other sources from nice food sources as well as taking it from your supplements but you're not going to get the desired effect you you will still end up with vitamin b12 deficiency that is the problem okay that is a problem the fact that using spirulina means you end up with vitamin b12 deficiency because it blocks the uh rivers and b12 from getting absorbed you know in the small intestine and even the liquid that gets absorbed does not get to the receptor sites where in the tissues where the vitamin b12 is needed so you end up with vitamin b12 deficiency you might say why can't the vitamin b12 from the supplements be able to defuse that problem well it doesn't because of the the competition for for the receptor size so you don't really want to use a spirulina at all because of competition for receptor sites with the real vitamin b12 from other food sources and even from your supplement now what makes matters worse is that uh even your blood test cannot distinguish between pseudo vitamin b12 and the real vitamin b12 so you might do your blood test and your blood sugar is going to come back normal and then you feel falsely reassured so um there is no way around it the only way around it is for you to actually stop using spirulina all together so the lessons here are that the vitamin b12 in spirulina is not the real vitamin b12 it is a pseudo vitamin b12 which means it's an analog and because it's structurally similar to the really vitamin b12 it competes with the realverton b12 and blocks the button b12 from doing its job where it is needed and then you end up with vitamin b12 deficiency so you really do not want to go there and the problem is not solved by just taking vitamin b12 supplements because uh in any case you know vitamin b12 even from supplements is poorly absorbed anyway in the small intestine so the last thing you really want to do is introduce competition uh in this case uh competition is bad for your health so what does the deficiency mean well now if there's one vitamin you don't want to play with you know one vitamin you don't want to mess with is vitamin b12 it might look simple but the deficiency of vitamin b12 has far-reaching uh consequences and you really do not want to mess with that consequences like you know megaloblastic anemia but you say maybe that could be easily corrected but that's true it's got psychiatric implications because vitamin b12 deficiency has been implicated in depression it's got neurological implications okay and that's the one that's really really devastating and sometimes it could be irreversible the neurological complications you really don't want to mess with that and it's also got cardiovascular implications if you remember i did a video where i talked about the link between vitamin b12 deficiency and homocysteine which leads to strokes and heart attacks so as you can see the consequences of vitamin b12 deficiency can be devastating you really do not want to mess with that vitamin seriously so if there's anything that is going to block your vitamin b12 from getting absorbed or from getting utilized by the tissues that need it you have to avoid that food products altogether that is my advice so uh spirulina belongs to the shelf you should leave it there and like i said it's nothing to do with the brand uh all spirulina products have the same problem they got the pseudo vitamin b12 and the pseudo vitamin b12 is a competitor for the real vitamin b12 and that is not something you want to mess with okay so a word is enough for the wise they say uh please stay away from spirulina altogether so uh if you enjoyed this video as usual please give the video a thumbs up please like the video uh please share this video with your friends family and colleagues and uh if you've got any comments any questions please leave them down below and there if you haven't joined us yet at the 2020 forum platform please go ahead and do so we discuss awareness issues over there um i think that's about it until next time well this is dr joe signing out", "12TRWYf2T5U": "was looking at the science I found a 2013 consumer report that discussed how 69% of raw pork samples were contaminated with a number of different bacteria and parasites particularly very high in ursini ax and Toro Kalitta which is a really really really bad parasite to get cause a lot of G I stress so gastrointestinal stress diarrhea I mean a lot of reports of people die all over the world with this sort of infection and so it's very very hazardous also on top of that you know pigs are known to carry tapeworms which believe are not very very common and once we get tapeworms in our system they're very hard to eliminate I work with a lot of clients using parasite protocols in order to help eliminate these things but it's very challenging in order to do that parasites will reduce your immune system and put chronic stress on your body a lot of these people with parasite infections they don't sleep well at night because parasites stimulate stress hormones at night stress hormones go up the individual doesn't sleep well in fact that's one of the signs that you may have a parasite is you know 10 11 12 o'clock at night all of a sudden you're wired right and you just can't fall asleep you struggle to fall asleep no matter how hard you try that is actually a sign right that a well-versed clinician will say possibly there could be a parasite playing a role here and pork is one of the biggest carriers of parasites so you know we look at the science it just shows that we've got all these parasites in the animal products and now we can cook and we could try to really really cook it or out of high temperature to kill off as many of these parasites as possible and that's definitely effective to a degree but some of the parasites are actually so Verlin they're so resistant that they can survive even high heat so so an animal like pork again not a whole lot of vital nutrients that we can't get really no vital nutrients that we can't get from other animals like lamb grass-fed beef consuming bison or wild game wild caught fish we get much more a much greater nutrient value out of those animals right and consuming those then we would out a pork and then with we're also taking in a high risk for parasites and then other environmental chemicals and toxins as well when we barbeque or we cook at a really really high temperature we actually caused a number of carcinogenic chemicals particularly things like heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and these polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PA CH is that's produced when we're in a sense when we're smoking the meat right so the smoke aspect produces these PA C H's which are known carcinogens right so they really increase our risk of developing cancer and then heterocyclic amines so whenever you've got blackened spots on your meat that's a buildup of heterocyclic amines which are basically proteins that have been broken down in a certain fashion and they become really potent free radicals that cause a lot of oxidative stress and tissue damage in our body so clearly we don't want that and then also the carbohydrate in the muscle meat gets burned up and it produces something called acrylamide which is another carcinogen so you got three are the most potent carcinogens that you are actually producing when you barbeque something so I'm not a big fan of barbecuing at a really high temperature any sort of meat and so when we try to do that with pork we're obviously going to cause problems", "58HHNX0oCcs": "According to the internet a super food can\nbe anything from bone broth, coconut oil, salmon to olive oil but the two foods Dr Greger\nis about to tell us about can truly be classed as super foods as they are heavily backed\nby scientific data that demonstrates their extraordinary beneficial effects on the body.\nThe first foods most notable benefits are it\u2019s powerful effects against cancer and\nit\u2019s large number of different antioxidants such as Kaempferol, Quercetin, Carotenoids,\nSulforaphane and the rather unique Indole-3-carbinol. This foods ability to prevent and repair DNA\ndamage is extremely impressive. This is important because damage to your DNA can lead to mutations\nand eventually cancer growth. We\u2019ll hear more about this later on in the video. The\nother food is one of my personal favorites as it is unbelievably powerful against cancer\nand inflammation. Not only does it protect against cancer and may even help to reverse\nit, but it also has a staggering effect on our brain. Neurons, specialized cells transmitting\nnerve impulses, are capable of forming new connections and in certain areas of our brain\nthey can also multiply and increase in number. One of the main drivers of this process is\nbrain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is a type of growth hormone that functions\nin our brain. Many brain disorders have been linked to decreased levels of this hormone,\nincluding depression and Alzheimer's disease. However the active component of this particular\nfood can increase brain levels of BDNF. Which may be effective in delaying or even reversing\nmany brain diseases and age-related decreases in brain function. So what are these two foods?\nWell let\u2019s hear now as Dr Michael Greger tells us the link to the original video is\nin the description below\u2026.Yes I think I probably talk about broccoli more than anything\nelse. So broccoli and all cruciferous vegetables all cabbage family vegetables, like kale and\ncollard greens, create a compound called sulforaphane which actually increases our phase 2 enzymes\nin our liver these are detoxification enzymes such that for example if smokers eat lots\nof broccoli you actually decrease the DNA damage, you can measure DNA damage in the\nurine in the blood. In fact if you eat broccoli you\u2019re going to get less of a caffeine buzz\nfrom your coffee just because your liver is so souped up in terms of detoxing. It actually\nwill mitigate the effects of smoking but the amount of DNA damage is still, even with all\nthe broccoli, is still above that of non smokers so absolutely we need to quit smoking but\nuntil one does there\u2019s way we can mediate some of the damage. There are 50 clinical\ntrials, this is very rare for a food, 50 clinical trials that have pitted turmeric against a\nvariety of diseases, lung disease, brain diseases and cancers. It\u2019s been found to make colon\npolyps disappear. It works better for rheumatoid arthritis than the leading drug may also work\nfor osteoarthritis and other inflammatory conditions such as lupus, inflammatory bowel\ndisease. I recommend a \u00bc tsp of turmeric a day. That\u2019s one of the thoughts of why\nthere\u2019s such low rates of colorectal cancer rates in India- is because of their turmeric\nconsumption. May also be because they eat a lot of beans, they eat a lot of legumes\nsuch as lentils\u2026..It\u2019s important to note that number 1, when consuming broccoli or\nany cruciferous vegetable daily we need to make sure we are getting a good reliable source\nof iodine in our diet. For more information check out my iodine on a plant based diet\nplaylist. Number 2 there are a small number of people who must to eat turmeric so make\nsure to watch the video linked above.", "DRQJvVJhAEQ": "hey guys dr. axe here today I wanted to share with you my personal morning smoothie what I consumed almost every single morning for breakfast and you know I've tried a lot of different things in terms of different fruits different flavors to see what I like the best so this smoothie one it is super nutritious Italian collagen it's high in antioxidants it's high in fiber its high and healthy fats but also it tastes amazing so you're gonna love this recipe so we're gonna start off here with one cup of either almond milk or coconut milk you can sort of pick which one you like the best now coconut milk is great because as MCTS which really is that probably the easiest type of fat for your body to burn is fuel so MCTS have a lot of benefits almond milk has more monounsaturated fats almond milk is also high in an amino acid called l-arginine which is great for strength and your cardiovascular system so I'm gonna add in today I've got some almond milk here so one scoop of almond milk when you're buying any type of milk when it's a plant-based milk you obviously it's great to look for organic or just something that's a really clean healthy brand with less ingredients is better all right so we've got some healthy fat there in this almond / coconut milk the next thing I'm going to add in here are frozen cherries now cherries oftentimes don't get the same press as blueberries but cherries are one of the most antioxidant rich super foods on the entire planet and they taste amazing especially when combined with chocolate flavor so I'm gonna add one either about one cup of frozen cherries there into the screen you can do anywhere from a half a cup to a full cup of that fruit and so again we're getting lots of antioxidants and the cherries the next thing I'm gonna add in is some chia seed powder okay now chia seeds were used by Aztec warriors okay many years ago and they were known to really help support your energy levels now chia is high in protein high in omega-3 fatty acids high in fiber so we're gonna add in about a teaspoon there chia you could also add in flax or hemp both of those are great as well I'm picking chia here today in my superfood smoothie all right another few ingredients here we got a couple more I'm gonna talk about this antioxidant powder in a minute but I'm gonna get in bone broth protein this is by ancient nutrition and the chocolate flavor okay now here's a great thing is that typically I used to make bone broth for years you know what it would take me 24 to 48 hours to make a good bone broth in fact that's how long it would take me to make it Chelsea and I would drive from Nashville down to Franklin Tennessee you know 30-minute plus Drive and then we get our organic chicken bones we'd make it back in the house and it just was really time consuming and then we came out with bone broth protein and we're getting the same quality bone broth we got at the farmers market now in powder form with great flavors like this that we could add into smoothie so you know I always try and get at least one but ideally I try and get two to three servings of bone broth in my diet every single day and the reason I do bone broth over a lot of other types of protein powder is it's paleo friendly keto friendly also its gut friendly which most protein powders are not only does it have all that collagen it has hyaluronic acid glucosamine chondroitin all those things in this one single powder so it's great for kids adults everybody should be getting at least one serving but ideally two to three servings of bone broth and collagen today now here's another secret ingredient this is acai berry powder now to be honest I ran out of it I didn't order in time for this video so the other thing I typically use instead I typically do either goji berry powder or pomegranate powder in this smoothie so you can order those online you can pick them up at your health food store that's either goji berry powder or pomegranate powder and I add that into smoothie because I'm out today I'm going to add in just a little bit of acai berry powder there but usually do a full tablespoon of pomegranate or goji powder the reason I love those two powders is they are loaded with antioxidants those antioxidants are great for anti-aging they protect your body from any type of UV sun damage or and they also are just in general just great for preventing oxidation you know what happens as we age is we oxidize you ever take a bite of an apple it turns brown that's oxidation that can happen to our skin that can happen to our in sighs antioxidants help with that some of the most powerful are those super berries from around the world again goji and an acai and pomegranate are some of the best now last ingredient in the smoothie is pumpkin pie spice just a little bit now you can also just add cinnamon if you have cinnamon in your home the thing I love about pumpkin spice spice is it's got cinnamon cloves nutmeg and ginger and has a great flavor so I just do a couple dashes there of those antioxidants of the pumpkin pie spice okay and and so again all the things I put in the smoothie remember we got the almond or coconut milk one cup one scoop of bone broth protein one cup of frozen cherries antioxidant powder and a couple dashes thereof pumpkin pie spice or if you don't have it cinnamon works great as well and we're simply gonna blend this up here and I will be drinking some of this because this is my smoothie and I love it all right here we go get this going all right this is so fast and easy this is why I mean this is sort of my go-to recipe recipe you know when I ran my functional medicine practice in Nashville Tennessee and all my patients coming in I mean this is really the first sort of thing that I have all my patients start to take is I have them start consuming a superfood smoothie every morning for breakfast and if you're not consuming a superfood smoothie daily you're really missing out it's one of the greatest ways to get all of these nutrients we're talking collagen healthy fats antioxidant super herbs and spices all together I didn't mention cinnamon I mean cinnamon contains cinnamaldehyde which can actually support your blood sugar help energy levels metabolism all these great benefits I'm gonna try it try this out this is really frothy creamy absolutely delicious so this is a great recipe that I think you and your family are gonna love and listen you can swap out ingredients if you don't have frozen cherries it's okay adding frozen blueberries or raspberries they're actually another great thing to pair with a chocolate here if you don't have coconut milk use almond milk and vice versa but again doing a general smoothie like this every single day and I often times do it twice a day because I do it this smoothie first thing when I wake up in the morning then a lot of times I do in the afternoon is a snack after my workouts I'll do this around the time of my workouts as well sort of recovery there because we know we all know we need more collagen around that time as well so again I hope you've enjoyed this recipe on how to make a smoothie that's loaded with collagen that's loaded with nutrients and again this is my personal recipe of what we make in the axe household almost every single morning now if you want to learn more about how to make some healthy recipes make sure to check out my youtube channel I hope you've enjoyed this video on how to make a superfood smoothie"}
