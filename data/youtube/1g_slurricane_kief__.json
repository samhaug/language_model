{"aM1yQRZ6g7Y": "what's up everyone welcome to the smoke session today I'm gonna be talking about Keith and I actually have some Keith's loaded up in the bong if you want to know how to get Keith you just have to get a grinder with a bottom piece like this not all grinders have these so if you're just going to your local head shop you just have to make sure you ask about the bottom piece that might have the pollen collector is one way to call it or if you're an illegal state you can just ask for the Keith catcher you can see that Keith in there usually they come with a little scooper so you can just scoop up the Keith easier if you don't have one of those a something like a penny or a nickel works well also I have the high side loaded up let's fire it up before I started using grinders the biggest thing I really wondered is how much weed does it really take to get a certain amount of Keef so my answer to that is it depends how good your weed is for those who don't know Keef is the trichomes on the buds basically so the more tri comes the more buds you're gonna get the other thing that can help you get more Keef is if you have your grinder like this and you just hit it up against something hard you could use your hand if you need to but you'd have to hit it pretty hard what works best is just a really hard surface like a rock or maybe a coffee table or any sort of table would work great and that knocks the Keef down into there I'd say to get about on average like enough to put like a Keith dome on top you probably need at least maybe about a 20 sack at the least two grams or an eighth would be ideal probably for that and to get a key full like if you want to fill the whole bowl up with Keef like I said again it really depends how good your whe it is but the best estimate is anywhere from 7 grams to 14 grams you know so that's 7 grams at the least to 14 grams I would say at the most but like I saying it all depends how good your weed is because the Keef is the trichomes that comes off the buds let's take another rip of the bowl if you liked what you saw make sure to give the hit to that thumbs up button subscribe if you want to see more leave any questions concerns anything else in the comments I'll see you guys next time", "SwWQeTwtC00": "[Music] hello and welcome back to the cannabis Somali eh I'm your host Andrew Friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of cannabis reviews today because of legalization 2.0 the new product categories I'm finally able to bring you a legally distributed extract now it's not the extract or the quality that you may have seen on the channel two years ago or any of the hash rosen's that I've had recently gifted to me by friends but at least it is an extract in the legal market it's something that I can purchase to really ramp things up and it's starting to feel more like the legacy market of purchasing cannabis in the dispensary now that we have these products so what did I get today we have BC Keef and this BC Keith is coming to us from can of farms I didn't look where canif arms is but I have a feeling it's not in BC but it might be that was a good ramble needless to say I don't know but it's called BC Keith and you can see it there maybe if it'll focus no I got another video there we go BC Keith can of farms you can read everything going on there see our duty steel still on perfect I picked this up yesterday for the low low price of twenty seven dollars for one gram of Keith CR twenty seven dollars maybe twenty seven bucks the green easy there are four hundred twenty one forty two point one milligrams of THC and total THC is three hundred thirty two milligrams so that'll be interesting to just see how much contaminant is in here with that note ice with an extra six hundred milligrams of something in there that's not THC and no CBD we can only assume that it is a plant matter but who knows this is the equivalent of it says content equivalent of four grams of carrying cannabis so that's interesting our Keef packaged on 2019 11:27 today is March the fourth start a cool cool dry place camp section and what's our warning adolescents are at a greater risk neo daily used for long period of time can harm brain development well I'm doing pretty good but if you're under the age of 18 click out of this video now cuz you're not even supposed to be here so there we go there is our beautiful product we have our seal Duty seal here and let's just crack right in shall we try on the new two camera so that we get a little bit closer of a view when we open up these products and now you can see our nicely set jar if I can get it out with a false bottom in the package let's check that out so just to have some more shelf space or something I don't actually know why you would need to do that but that's okay we'll see things in the future changing so here is our package and you know I wouldn't have been upset actually just getting this with all the information off the shelf but there's no branding on it and there's an apparent smell of cannabis coming off of it so there we go the nice blue glass oh yeah the blue glass yuan jar so that's a that's a nice perk for sure here we go and do we have a different warning frequent to prolong cannabis containing tea if she can contribute to mental health problems over time BC chief I don't know what where DC or why they call it BC chief but it's obviously not strand-specific and again packed Sean 11:27 pretty cool let's open it up shall we our first legal extract and our first legal extract has a nice jar with a child seal on it so of course there we go and that is the first look of our BC Keef there it is you can see I've got the nice close-up video now though recommended by a YouTube follower thank you so much for your recommendation so it is a little green it's uh it's looking like a pre you know it's um it's a it's a pretty rough tumble without a doubt I don't think it's um just take through it a little bit here okay so it's clumped up it does still have a little bit of moisture going on in it let's see how it smells it smells a little green to be very honest with you it's a little over tumbled I didn't expect like the most amazing Keefe hash whatever for those of you that don't know the word Keith Keefe is usually the sifted hash the that forms in the bottom of your grinder has been the slang term that I've always used for Keef but it's just a jet\u00e9 today anibus usually found in the bottom chamber of your grinder I'm wondering if there's even in this one just to show a contrast of what grinder Keith yes there is so that's my grinder Keith just a little bit this is probably really old and then that's the color of this so it is pretty close without a doubt I can't say anything about that so it smells a little green has like some really big woodsy aromas that I would relate to lemongrass sandalwood maybe a little bit of pine some fresh downed trees I'm gonna put a little bit of my fingers actually and squish it and just see if we can get anything going here that's what it looks like all my fingers and let's see if I can just smell it better mmm smells like very handsome Cologne sandalwood musk earthy musky a little bit of a citrus definitely is gonna taste good like as I smell it and I smell a cannabis aromas smells good my fingers are a little bit sticky after rubbing it but nothing crazy so I figured out you would use two ways to kind of evaluate this sample just because it is straight Keith I didn't know exactly what I should do I've always used my vaporizer it's not a dabble product by any means there is contaminant and particulate in it so I'm thinking that I will do a puff of the volcano vaporizer and then I have this bong that I got in grade 11 that I cleaned up and I thought I'd have a puff out of that too for you since uh since we're playing that game so let's just have a load up on our volcano here I have a new camera facing down so that I can show you all of the unboxings a little bit closer as opposed to holding it up so that is what I'm doing down there Sears our volcano bowl and I'm going to put a good load of the Keef in there we go spread it out so it's nice and flat I'm not in these balls so that we don't get any of that nonsense there we go maybe a little more for just for good luck we are doing a a review so there we go and I didn't wait this one either mainly because I just don't know how we're going to weigh it it was a pretty full jar of light Akif so I'm hoping that they didn't rip me off but what have we found with our legal cannabis reviews in the past that well 70% of them have been short so you know I could see that happening with my Keef but I'm writing tickets about so let's load this up air and while that happens there I'm gonna load my bowl up still have a messy but that's okay well two things at once two things at once there we go all right smells good in the air smells very cannabis e very woodsy I didn't get much but what I did get really tastes like how it smells musky lemony very much like Cologne that would have been worn in the 1990s I'm gonna let it sit on there for a sec just a little that Keefe warm up and I'm going to go back to back in this bowl of Keefe up because we're gonna take one one big friggin rip a dip of this I believe here we go that's that and now my ball should be warmed up [Music] do you like Keith I always love it as a supercharger it's really nice when you open up the bottom of your grinder and you find those dunes again I'm happy that these products are on market and for $27 I can say I'm oh you know I'm not upset right now with my purchase this time I let the hash warm up in the bowl sitting on top of the heating unit and it is quite tasty it all tastes the same every time I do musky sandalwood II delicious so it's yeah pretty good well let's have our bong rip and then give you our final notes and my final goodbye I've got this big-ass bowl of hash Keef pack BC Keith from kin of farms let's roll back little it's definitely fair to say I've had a bong rip in a long time okay it was good it definitely didn't suck so here we go let's do the rundown on appearance it's definitely not the best key hash anything that I have ever seen by any means but it looks nice it looks like blond hash from high school so there's that as far as appearance goes I'm going to give it a the jar they put it in is really nice and they'll end up and the childproof lid was slick so let's give it and this is for what is being Keefe I'm gonna give it 17 points 17 points for the appearance on the nose it wasn't jumping out but it definitely still smells like what it tasted like the nose knows that my nose said you should definitely smoke this for the nose I'd like to give it 32 points it could be bigger it could be better but it's definitely not lacking or upsetting me it's not jumping out but it does have these nice woodsy musky somewhat citrusy aroma for the taste I thought the taste match the palate really well again it wasn't huge it wasn't explosive in my mouth it wasn't like oh my god this is the best hash Keef whatever I've ever tried didn't taste bad in the bong definitely tasted better in the vaporizer so for taste let's give it a solid you know this is falling with the nose too right if the nose was bigger than the taste would have been bigger I'm gonna want to call it 15 points for the taste not bad not amazing that's 75% and then my overall impression based on my experience with cannabis based on my experience with the legal market all of these things coming into play you know what I don't mind this product it's definitely an addition to a joint or something that you'd like to buy to add into your basket to really ramp everything up so as far as that goes I'm gonna give it 17 points and there you go that's the score on our can of farms BC Keef pretty good for especially for $27 so well let's add up the points right here duh how many points is that 27 bucks a gram Keith definitely not the worst thing to purchase in the recreational market as these things become available this is the very first extract I've seen that's why I purchased it I guess I guess I'm pleasantly surprised it's probably it's it's in the 80s for sure it might be high 70s but it's in the 80s so it's it's it's not bad I'm not completely upset there you go thank you so much for watching if you tried any extracts let me know down in the comments I'm really looking forward to having more extracts come on to market but it's exciting to see this happening please make sure to LIKE comment share and subscribe and I'll see you soon Cheers what's my name what's my name the cannabis Somali yang",

got the headache no wait headband headache it's headband we've got edison black cherry punch there we go we shuffled it up nicely and there's the spin i'm hoping for i'm hoping for the biomed because i need seven keep going keep going oh yes this is a seven pack so i'm kind of excited about that here's the thc biomed it's the sativa thc sativa land race whatever that means and they've got thc totals 194 milligrams per gram or 19.4 so on ocs a 7 of this goes for the high price of 27.90 which is actually a really good price so that's a seven 27 bucks for seven so i think that's around four gram maybe i don't know if my math is off on that or not uh let's check out the scale make sure it's all accurate here we'll check it with a 50.00 gram weight like this and we're good so we put that here so for this one we're gonna use the red bowl because uh i need a bigger container let's see i could see it right there 27.32 is the bowl let's just zero that out there we go can we see that that looks nice right there look at that wait oh my goodness if i block some of the light we can see it better look at that well maybe not anyways here we go thc biomed time oh my god that thing came off so easily it's like it wasn't even on but they have a seal unlike tweed so that's nice let's open the seal oh i had a little fart sound when i opened it too that's always a good sign oh that smells real nice [Music] hmm it's kind of got like a citrusy kind of a thing in there oh and fuck what's the date on here got to check the date december the 21st that's awesome today is january the 20th so just just under a month wow look at this they left me a section of sticky stuff smells fucking great though here we go let's see what we got look at this 6.97 that's fucking awesome i keep smelling it because it smells really good you don't normally get stuff that smells so good and this was only 27 bucks all right so here's all the like the big buds the bigger buds here's the smaller buds here but i mean it looks actually not bad for 27 this looks okay smells real nice and um i guess we'll check it with a microscope next so we're checking out the outside of the thc biomed thc's tv land race it's got all kinds of trichomes here we've got all kinds we got some little bits of uh little bits of amber some of them and they actually look pretty nice a lot of trichome coverage on these buds look at that fucking awesome and the nice looking trichome some of them too hey look right there we've got a nice yellow one right mid center that looks so cool that little yellow one and we got we got like these waxy chunky ones here we've got nice clear ones we've got nice cloudy ones we've got amber ones got brown ones there's yellow ones there's all of them there's another oh my god look at them on here this butt here oh my god look at these trichomes right here this looks so nice can i get a zoom in on that wow look in the lower right oh my god those trichomes look so nice in the left now oh man i'm trying to get a nice zoom but i keep knocking it slightly anyways they're nice looking here's a zoom in on some of the chunky ones look at this looks like a bunch of like weeds that all blew over or something in the wind very nice so you can see lots of uh trichomes all over the place on this stuff there's some more right there it looks real nice this stuff it smells nice looks nice it's not too dry it's dry but it's not like dust they still like see i'm giving it a squeeze it's real tight bud some of them but they don't turn into a dust that actually took some effort to get that out there but like yeah they bust up nice anyways let's break open one of these buds and take a look inside maybe let's open this one why not right here's a look at the inside of the bud it's um real kind of now there's still there's a decent amount of clear ones and there's still some waxy in here somewhere i saw some and there's some of like the uh the big clumpy ones you know but yeah there's a lot of clear ones inside some cloudy anyways though um looks alright it smells good so i'm gonna go try this and i'll be right back hey so i just got in from this uh thc biomed thc sativa land race at 19.4 percent and um this stuff is really good what a nice surprise um when i went to to vape this uh you know what you know what this reminds me of and you know what i'm gonna just go out and say that this is that's what i think this is is ultra sour it tastes exactly like ultra sour maybe a little light on the gas like on the diesel but it tastes like ultra sour it's really good tasting not as strong as a lot of the other ones but it's the flavor is there the whole way through and it's nice i i swear this is ultra sour yeah so if this is not ultra sour then it's got to be something closely related ultra sour i think is mk ultra and sour diesel so definitely got some sour diesel in there i i swear it is i swear but yeah this this reminds me so much of ultra sour very nice tasting um maybe lighter than some of the other ultra sours but it's you can get the taste there and it's good uh the high on here is really nice it's like a medium high to a very high there was a nice weight in there we had 6.97 that's perfect the price on this holy shit 27 bucks or 28 bucks for seven oh my god this is awesome i'm so happy i was not expecting it to be this good i was expecting it to be okay this is really good i'm so happy i'm so happy um would i buy this again hell yeah i don't know if it's always gonna be this in there though this is one of those ones where i think they can change it up oh and it's also listed as sativa dominant hybrid which is also what ultra sour is so um yeah wow that's awesome and it's great for the price oh my god that's awesome i have no complaints anyways we got what was there two things left on the thc twister so um come check it out hit the subscribe button and the notification bell and then uh it'll tell you when the next one comes up and that's it for now so uh have yourself a good one see you later just realized i forgot to mention what the high is like on this [Laughter] i said it's like in the very high region or the medium high but it's a nice uh energy one with like you know it's real happy kind of fun and uh and um entertaining it's very nice it's for 27 bucks it's awesome and yeah it's not a couch lock or anything like that so yeah i just thought i would add that in because i forgot oops anyway see you later", "xn0PkCr4qmI": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back or welcome if you're new to my channel in today's video I have two different bongs both of these bowls are packed entirely it with chief let me get you a close-up look how [ __ ] beautiful I'm so excited I'm not somebody who really has ever packed an entire bowl of Keefe I always sprinkle it on top and throw it in my joints in my blunts and just kind of you know a little bit everywhere but I'm really excited to smoke this with you guys today wow I'm pretty sure this is a wide mouth yeah it is sighs I can make my bong blue that's dope I just realized that I was gonna mention that I was drinking my water out of a mason jar and it kind of looks like the ball but I can make mine blue I could screw this on the bottom not be so [ __ ] wet I might have to do that guys I'm too intrigued now all right guys I'm going to start off with some hits out of the mason jar belong I have already taken some hits out of that today so I really want to take some hits out of this first all right guys like always let me know what you are smoking on in the comments and cheers guys one of the key is just gonna continuously plan so I really need to hit it but [ __ ] Rex right there it's definitely gonna be rough to get through an entire bowl more or less two of just keys but just cuz it's so rough on your throat I feel like I should just take a really really fat one keep smoke is honestly like the prettiest first Keith pulldown photograph the second one my memory card is about pool so I'll be right back cousin cameras about to cut up before I get into smoking ball number two with you guys I wanted to say thank you for all of the support on my channel it has been absolutely crazy I think at this very moment we are at 4.2 something so it's 4:20 month we're at 4.2 K I was just kind of in it I don't know it's funny I think of it like that but thank you guys so much for all the support it really means the world to me I hope to get a smoke with some of you one day that would be so dope but I hope you guys are all staying healthy and having a great day and cheers on board number two where's my camera didn't think like this part of my wall was like the focus point of my videos I'm going to take the ice out of this cup use it's a good ice and get rid of my bad water Keith tastes so good this bull is about gone this will probably be the last hit two balls and two balls to clean but I like smoking out of a bunch of different bongs what's the point of having a [ __ ] ton of them if I'm not gonna like stash with all of them at once so I hope you guys enjoyed watching me struggle to smoke those tools of Keith if you did it make sure to give this video a big [ __ ] like also if you've never seen my face and you were new to my channel make sure you subscribe I post videos four times a week Monday Wednesday Friday Saturday and then most of the time an extra video on Sunday for you too if you want some more content for me it made sure to check out my Instagram my handle will be on the screen right now I go live on there with you guys and just stuff sessions and I notify you every single time I post a video so definitely check out my Instagram if you want to be it just a little bit more engaged and I hope to see you guys in my next one Keith love yes states Dave", "WlxAbUSVNcs": "what's good guys this video is intended for people over the age of 18 so if you're not over 18 just do me a solid head out for me and if you are over 18 do not try this at home houses may be a little more it's good right there alright what's going on everybody welcome to the video today didn't plan on making this video but I kind of decided you know what I got some good some good we can I can give out to people that you know may not know about where for people that don't really know about Keith and stuff like that so before we [ __ ] continuing further you guys get that too it's like the first time you smoke during the day Sydney water so the topic of this video is the best way to use your keys so for those of you that don't know basically what Keef is is Keef is the part of your bud that gets you high it's after you grind it up all the trichomes and [ __ ] and most grinders is a little men and under that little net there's like a third compartment and in that is key it's the good stuff but the stuff you want so people what they normally do is they [ __ ] take the grinder and grind up the bunch of [ __ ] bud after weeks and weeks or however long you want to wait at the bottom you accumulate Keef and you could put it in a bowl you can put it in whatever the [ __ ] you want and that's just pure like [ __ ] gay pie powder and this is just my opinion right people other people could have other opinions and stuff like that but you know that's them I'm telling you the best way I think it is to use your keys and the honestly it's with your but that's plain and simple what you want to do so we're gonna go ahead and take another bowl of both can you see that this is a good video put a better one on the screen but this is what you want bro all that brown stuff on the brown little sugar at the top that's the [ __ ] good stuff right there I thought I was gonna hold it way too soon I see a lot of people like to pull their [ __ ] bowls through like you're sucking right through and like oh [ __ ] and like I get it but like all I think it really does is just dirty your piece so I really I don't like to pull it through I kind of like loading in all at the bottom when I [ __ ] head and just take it yeah I think the best way to use your [ __ ] Keef is with your book so let's say that you wanted to smoke a bowl alright just like a regular [ __ ] Keef bowl that [ __ ] like it's so powdery that you get high for sure you definitely don't need a lot to get high with Keith but you [ __ ] pack the bowl and it would just snap right through it's literally one pull and you're done you couldn't pass that around everything just cuz it's so cautery so when you use the bud the Keith sticks to the bud rather than just the [ __ ] Keith being by itself and getting sucked through um also I heard a really good [ __ ] well what's something similar to like it's not like a metaphor again analogy boom let's say you have your favorite [ __ ] dish right your favorite meal of all time are you gonna save the best part of that food later like in six months and when there's like a little bit left and you might have some left after it's been like left out and [ __ ] like that now it's just like bro tax then I stopped grinding with the [ __ ] keep catcher and have I noticed a difference am I getting a lot more high no I don't know but I mean a taste good you know I'm saying just flour alright this should be alright you know we got the Christmas lights and the ladder in the back just I'm trying to get the whole bong in this one off it's just flour in this bowl I don't have that much Keith and I'll tell you why after I hit this but man hopefully it looks good it's [ __ ] ass try that again don't [ __ ] this employ [Music] there you go for all you [ __ ] Bowl snappers it has this little [ __ ] dick and it's perfect because you can take your bowl and there's nothing in it now but you can just [ __ ] in and my bowl is black alright it's not dirty actually it is pretty [ __ ] dirty right here is supposed to be clear so I got this [ __ ] downstem right it's from our Bowl and downstem I wanted a black downstem and Bowl to begin with because you couldn't tell if it was dirty and it looks nothing black looks cool but mainly cuz you couldn't it wouldn't look dirty it gets a little ball at the bottom with little slits but when you have the little slits it doesn't really think hole in milk it'll milk up nice and you go to clear and duh it's like sucking through like a strong muffling the [ __ ] your error from bong to your mouth so I tried cutting it making this little bit bigger and I broke in half just been like this like [ __ ] half moon thing but it works alright so my camera better be [ __ ] done real quick but we're back I charge us a little bit we still got a little bit all nice and [ __ ] weird cuz it's like a half moon thing so like I'll try to get it closer bro I don't even know if I knew these are working [Music] [Music] that's another good thing to mix it with your buns just add like another it's like the spice bro it adds another layer of flavor a bad idea I don't know why I did that it's cold here like um like here in Florida it's [ __ ] it's not cold but it's Florida cold like I know there's people every time I say this we were like but I live in [ __ ] I live in Antarctica do as a negative 109 here well you don't know cold I'm just like all right yeah I feel you but like relativity man you're used to that [ __ ] boat tomorrow right now it's like 55 tomorrow it's gonna be like 82 [ __ ] hated hey the [ __ ] humidity bro just [ __ ] sweat and it's just icky you should walk through so you can like feel your self walking it's gross but when people ask me they're like do you prefer the hot of the cold I'd be like bro honestly we're not talking about extremes either like I'm not trying to say like [ __ ] 10 degrees outside there's some crazy [ __ ] like that like honestly I prefer it to be colder because my thing is that you can dress to be cold you can dress for the cold to be warm you can like put layers on and [ __ ] when it's hot us is lucky it doesn't matter if your butt ass naked you are hot as [ __ ] you're sweating it doesn't matter don't try to tell me [ __ ] cuz you know I'm right I'm warm this high so I saying this is gonna be it oh let me get a good better angle appreciate you guys for watching the video like subscribe the whole thing see you guys the next one probably in a week on Wednesday this is how to [ __ ] alright Cheers [Music] [Music]

we are back with another west coast weed tour review and we are doing some california dank dank it is a micro batch flower from alien labs and they got some wild top secret kind of like blacklisted um you know call of duty black ops style packaging going on here it's a really it's a really cool vibe it didn't really stand out on the shelf when we bought it but i remember when i got my hands on and looked at i was like oh i really like this vibe um yeah we're gonna put this uh what is this gmo times gelato number eight um we're gonna put it through our review system which is 10 categories 100 points all based around how consumers buy and look for weed so i'm gonna go ahead and grind up a little bit maybe if i can find my grinder oh sorry about that y'all the reason why i need a grinder i tried hand breaking some of these flowers uh first but i wasn't finding the flavor profile to come through nearly as much um when i ground it up and really released all those aromas so the it's gmo times gelato so i'm assuming i'm going to get some just funky garlic just really weird musky herbally savory terps really on the opposite side of like a citrus spectrum a complete opposite of anything like that that's definitely what i get when the first smell let's break open this grinder oh yeah definitely like a savory you know it smells almost like a like a like some kind of food it's like herbs like a spice rack you know one snapper talk about the taste tell you what i think about it and we'll see what the final score is shout outs to malibu team for hooking us up with these beautiful pieces as you can see i've been putting in the review work today y'all some some yellow water some remains but nonetheless beautiful rig beautiful function shout out to higher standards oh man the functionality is really cool on this little piece all right so presentation definitely give this an 8 8.5 um it's really cool like i said it's kind of like if you know you know type of thing like they block over their alien labs logo on purpose um i really like it um it might not be for everyone but i really dug it product appeal especially since you see the strangeness gmo times gelato two of the most hyped strains on the market right now uh yeah i think that brings the product appeal up pretty high also total cannabinoids it's rocking up at 38.34 and 32.32 so testing's like that um you know it's going to fly off the shelves people love high cannabinoids and high thc color yeah 8.5 nothing crazy special but beautiful flowers some purple highlights yeah smell i give the smell seven didn't blow me away taste didn't blow me away there's seven potency uh i definitely can feel this one it it kind of makes my eyes sink a little bit um it's making me a little spacey i'm probably definitely gonna have to chill after this review get a little lunch break in me so i could uh keep going but uh yeah this is definitely a potent one i think i'm gonna throw this one up on the nines i mean i can feel it right away it's it's it's very euphoric it's making me kind of want to smile and just space out so the potency is definitely there experience definitely an eight um i have never really had anything bad from alien labs to be honest they have you know great genetics great quality um they're baklava strain i've tried so this is the second strain of tried from theirs and i love it more information available i give them an eight you know they do 8.5 you know they do actually have they have cultivated package cannabinoids some strained lineage um yeah a lot of companies don't even have the strain leading edges for their strains so i will bump them up a little bit and give them an 8.5 for that would you recommend i would recommend while the gmo strain is not my favorite um i don't like gmo at all but you know gmo's hyped people love it it's a popular strain so i would definitely recommend this be just knowing that a lot of people are gonna like the gmo terps the funkiness and then you mix it with the gelato and you just really can't go wrong overall i'm going to give this an 8. i really dig dug the overall vibe of the product um it is going to fetch an incredibly high price point but you know if you got this fresh i don't you know you're gonna get your money's worth i i imagine if you're if you're used to paying for alien labs prices um it's gonna meet alien labs expectations and so and that's all i have for you today make sure to like the video subscribe to the channel check out all our west coast we tour reviews we're doing everything this year edibles drinks flour dabs vape carts you name it we reviewed it and that's all i have for you today and have a good one bye", "iNj79_Wvx1U": "[Music]", "9BsSwyvj0Go": "or done be pressing some of this Keith here I'll weigh it out in a second to see how much exactly it is Oh God all right so I've pre-loaded in the bag there let's cheat on there just in case you gotta get it right perfectly centered there you let make sure it's centered let it sit there for at least fifteen to twenty seven let's sit there for like fifteen or twenty seconds this is that Keith try seven so we'll see how it turns out so let's sit there for just about they're not getting really direct but I have a feeling that it we're still getting got a little good return there so let's go ahead hold it up let's see what happens oh yeah uh yeah we did get a little bust here but look at what we go so we'll gather all that the brown and we squash it but look at all that gold there not a beautiful bowl thank you so we'll be able to repress us but we at least gathered the gold stuff that has no uh no the materia shed sometimes I feel really really slow low and slow really slow especially we got teeth because really gushes out of there you already have all the heads so the heads just make a lot of juice and sometimes that pressure is too much for the bad so here you go this is the first press of some nice Keith pieced out uncle stoner this so first thing we're going gather off a good shatter nodes getting all the good raza nice insistence in there okay I'm gonna reshat some doubt wow I can't wait till we repress this yeah and it's setting you know if your bag breaks it's okay just gather it gather everything out of the other bag rhe bag it up and you know just go low and slow and you'll still get the rest of your turn it's no loss of you breathe rip break the back little tips ring us a squash off and uncle stoner never gets a nice little yield even on that gorgeous that looks gorgeous so I'm gonna try that before we do the second press on that that's ever smell so gas inspired I got dry a little bit before your they'll press Wow nice really know what I'm talking about [ __ ] put a smile on my face like Fitz you know what some good at hustling all right let's do this yeah we've gathered it now we're gonna put it in a new bag gather all the stuff and do a second thrust on this put it back in there okay so we second press this course she didn't know nothing came out here that doesn't happen we still got something a little darker because we had to Trump to heat a little bit we still got something I still like that first dress though ooh wow really good smell though oh wow really a salary can like a super sour mm-hmm hmm really nice this is uncle stoner now we're about to head over to soma do a little interview with him check that out on my next I G TV post this is uncle stoner with squash off peace out", "8sX_dL0r-pY": "what's going on there but each a boy endo gross here hope everybody's having a wonderful wonderful day today's video is going to be on the slur Akane IX growing string review from in health genetics we have some right here as we can tell beautiful beautiful beautiful so yeah if you use the channel make sure to subscribe if you want to help support the channel a little bit more I'll leave a link to my patreon down below all sorts of cool exclusive content we're gonna do giveaways once we got more people on there all sorts of fun stuff but yeah we'll get right into it so this is the slur came from in-house genetics this is actually the i-x grown indoors under my hash propter with the pro hub beautiful flower a couple things in house genetics has some amazing stuff i will give them that but another side note and this is where i'm going to get into this this strain i'm gonna classify as a moderate to advanced growers only simply because it does not seem like they tested it i got there's either five or six pack it was like a hundred and thirty or hundred and forty dollars when i got it i believe and only one yes only one out of the whole entire pack was good everything else per meet in there super crazy unstable so moderate to advanced growers only you need to be really keeping a vigilant eye on this you need to check and make sure you're not getting harmed but if you put in the work some amazing product will come out at the end it's got this specific female had like a really really good yield too so very happy was that actually tell it's got some really nice chunky notes for an indoor grow a beautiful beautiful color I will give it that very frosty as well so I'll give it that as well very enjoyable to smoke I really like it as my daytime smoke so this is the slur k9x which is their slur Akane the slur came it's like one of the only things that I've seen it's really unstable from them so maybe go check out the slur cane which is their slur akane youdo see you might have to be no hunch a little bit but that's part of the fun so that's what this one is love to smoke it's got a really like key key in the face pungent almost a garlicky taste smell to it so really enjoy that everybody really really seems to like it sorry I dropped my nose yeah everybody really seems to like it I really enjoy it you can see the whole grow my beginner grill guide series is where we did this so just wanted to do a quick little thing real fast with this we can go through and do a lot of my strands that I grow like this so yeah moderate to advanced in house genetics start testing your strains if something goes out and you know stop selling it these packs are still for sale really okay and so don't do that in-house test your strains you already have enough money and enough gear that you can pull one thing off the shelf if it's not crazy stable or at least give people heads up that you're going to be spending a bunch of money and you're not gonna be getting what you want so yeah how does the whole pack only one was good everything else hurried probably worst pack I've ever drawn in my life in terms of that so I guess good job in house genetics on that you have successfully produced the most unstable pack that I've ever been able to get my hands on so cool but I do love the smoke I do love the strain at the end of the day was not worth the money but I did take the one stable cut that I had and I'm putting it to my violetta try to help stabilize a little bit and bring a little extra funk to it so definitely stay tuned for that I will hopefully be growing that within the next couple months but yeah I hope you all have a great day I hope you really enjoyed the video take it easy do something good for somebody today", "SYoufFj1FHg": "hey guys it's Brandon ROG for 20 and today I'm gonna be supposed to buy

[Music] so this is gnarly this is pretty much all key there I put a little bit at the bottom just to hold to hold the the key fair in the middle and then top it off with some more weed so this is a nice fat bull I'm gonna get ripped let's put this back so I'm gonna hit this now it's gonna be a pretty big head pretty much all Keith Keith makes me pop its home so [Music] [Music] peas gates", "CV1o82t6YJE": "morning and many blessings we're about to do some squashing of this beautiful Keith on rosin tech big smash we'll see how it turns out love rosin tech because they pretty much have a press for any kind of use that you need from high-end industrial but a lot of weight a lot of frosting to even a small little go press 750 pounds that you can use and travel with plus if you use the code uncle stoner and all caps on rosin techcom you'll get a 10% discount on anything you purchase from them alright so let's get squashing so this is 12 grams of Keith we're gonna be pressing low and slow we got it on 145 here for the first thing is you want to let just touch the material once it hits the material you want to stop and let it sit there for anywhere from 10 to 20 seconds you know letting it all first press of the 12 grams we just did we're about the we press it again cuz there's a lot left you can just see all the [Music] for the second spots we turn the heat up a little bit more just alright we repress this for three minutes just repress up 12 grams of Keith let's see what we got oh you did get a little blow out there down but we gather this around right here all that still got that and then that we just take away his uncle stoner using rosin tech peace out [Applause] [Music]", "WkOWXkAv2qk": "if you do to be chocolate 420 hit today on the channel we're doing few keeps up sucks you know I really enjoyed it just lately I have it or trying to save up for it in heaven I haven't ran my week years right there and well over go ahead gets Michael Byrne Testament real quick again so much watch video that we're going to be packing up the bowl with one of this clicker really orange or peach not orange colors that you know orange later with the stuff and then you got you know merely it's not that much but you know it's nothing it's my friend shopping so anyways there you guys may notice the different set up never happen right here I'm gonna clean up alright I'll go ahead and get the camera ended up you guys ready shut up I'm John I don't that I'm trying to adjust my truck on that it's kind of weird as you can see I'm using a tripod right here we have really one of the things about doing a burn shop I noticed with my camera if I don't put my hand in front of it the lighting get kind of weird oh all righty okay [ __ ] bit the chicken focus on all Rd conditions go ahead model who you consider to be passable ribbons video juice and as you guys know some kind of green and talks with my hand right there you know just providing is kind of weird because you can get the close-up of a glass or anything so I'm Annessa know I'm doing all right that's probably one of the only reasons I will grind up my wages I love that stuff okay so good there's actually some Keith that I've gotten before but I had a little bit of parchment paper and I was just sitting there pushing it down with my fingers and it actually was gaining a little bit liquidy in there like of course it wasn't like getting all threads out into some wax or anything but it actually was kind of wet kind of really good in any way go ahead yeah I should pull again I'm not really sure how well the camera now killing engine hey I can see it when I'm doing that camera for the burn show be honest with you the person was kind of bigger just because I had a little bit more for the first risk but nonetheless I'm single nice keyframing nonetheless okay please alright alright you guys really do this a lot keep it together smoke along with me like I can't years there you got a kind of you're going on across make it will go to my room you know just going to tell you that I did that and if we do the question to do and I won't go no you guys realize would be bad I got him heroic things yeah I was just getting a sense in early years before me ask it out to talk to learn how to talk about sighs you know what does done all right there we have it that's going to be it for this video wanted to give the 19 trips they here that might really like to a burn shop every time I have to that's one thing I haven't tried as well is since I'm starting to have found I had it put in a little on top of my bullet and I kinda love it exact you get one summer and giacomo sauce tasting like that I actually wanted you like a nice close-up on the melting down the tab will let you enjoy a

today we're loading herbal sage combs with weed keef and solvent list hash oil with the raw cone motor tool the new mean green herb ease from cyclones are in all natural tobacco free pre-rolled cones that we've really been enjoying here at Rafal studios the cones also happen to fit perfectly on the new raw cone loader tool that we debuted here a couple of months back the cones simply slide on the narrow tip of the cone load or tool where it will stay put while you scoop and funnel your ground herbs down into the cone the cones do come with a small plastic straw to pack the herbs in but we find it a lot more effective to use the tamping tool provided with the raw loader kit that wooden tool has a tapered shape with a narrow tip for firming up the skinny end of the cone near the filter and the wide end for tamping in the remainder and the wider end of the cone of course you could also load the cones very easily by hand but the loader does make it easier and less messy and if you're rolling multiple cones the loader is a real help [Music] now we have our cannabis loaded we're also want to juice it up with some very nice honey oil this is a solvent --less extract oil of green crack sativa and I'm using a syringe to drop a few drops into the end of the cone also leaving a little bit more room for some more goodies at the very tip now we're going to add in some Keef to fill out the last few centimeters now we have not tested these cones loaded fully with Keef but the impression is that it would be perfect for smoking Keef cones with an excellent taste of sage and keep complimenting nicely now our cone is fully packed and ready to light but before we do let's check out this cool offer for a limited time you can get an awesome raw mean green starter kit available

an excellent sweet sage flavor and smoke very very smoothly the wooden number seven dank tip also helps complement the smoothness of the burn and also stays nice and cool as you smoke the cone all the way down to the tip now we didn't have a little trouble with his comb burning unevenly mainly due to the oil we're dripped into it but even then it held together perfectly without dropping the cherry and even out and burned all the way to the tip despite the variety of contents inside I hope you enjoy checking out the new sage comes from cyclones if you did please hit the like button that's

of here so we have a significant amount of yeah sure you can that is Scooby Snacks Black Label well Robin the press then before that we have to mechanical separations as you can see one of the butter drawers and separations here that we have are I'm anticipating collecting a very very nice terpene fraction and then isolating the rest of the TAC a the second one is all second breast junk we're going to get rid of all that [ __ ] and hang on to ourselves on this - yeah but for right now we have just a little bit of one-to-one aliens sourapple hurricane it's just dress it of course dry said not not library not or not live hash not fresh frozen very simply just a nice little salad rice dip that we're going to press to start off the day it's elliptical okay hopefully everybody can enjoy their view from that seat I'm going to go ahead and finish setting up here and we've started to see here if I can I'm gonna pull that over and begin to work with it almost right away just bring it a little bit closer whoo what an image stabilization be such a nice feature okay there's and gentlemen unfortunately because I use a cell phone as a camera it's very very very possible that we may be once you have angles at some point through this short little video and I'm going to do my best to keep it short after all I'm just going to do a little hash press and as I'm going the hash press so I'll kind of show you guys what I'm going why I'm doing it let you know right now I am setting my temperature controller I'm going to go ahead and set the top and bottom plates to the same temperature and that will be a hash press and I want to I want to be able to bring it out quickly I got wondering is certainly not too hot it's a lot warmer than that about 20 15 to 20 degrees warmer than I would normally press hash but this is just some directive very very wide or broad spectrum mixed micron if you will so I'm going to give it a little bit more heat and for the purposes of preserving a higher quality you know we are going to use to 15 micron bag we will actually not almost forget that expressed that we're going to use one 15 micron value and then we are going to house that 15 micron bag in a 25 micron and why are we doing that ladies and gentlemen strength right just that simple so without further ado let's get into right here I got a little spoon ready I got my hash we're nice and clean and gloved up and let's see is there anything that we're forgetting I did mention the camera died so the flash dies or whatever not laters and if the camera dies um won't just switch it plug it in the only reason I would have to move around a little bit is because I don't have a lot of charger but I did remember the one thing we need to do before we get started yeah finish off this big back ask dad I got a little bit left over from my most recent Instagram post let's just put in this morning and this morning I attempted to do make a big diamondback snake dad you know samus DHEA etc anyway I put a half a pound of sauce - vanish at her and point three at TSD a huge huge dad got it all together got it going and then this is I failed to fold first when I was dropping the day I'm into the nail I was hitting it too hard and I hold so much of it to the neck that was honestly you couldn't really see that that well on camera [Music] I wasn't hitting it from this angle it was more like this angle so anyway to check the camera see how bad it was okay I forgot to unpause the video sorry I didn't record it I had to make a whole nother snake pattern and shatter - green sauce 23 grams of ghta and so my waking baby a sentence I'd never I don't really do anymore but my waking Bay today or video a grand assure that it's coming in just maybe 3 or 4 percent higher 92 maybe 93 and then I saw with half a gram over happy I did the best I could be edited and make it watchable as I'm sure you can imagine it took a very very long time smoke that not hash and the video is like right around three minutes long so you know finally I'm finally starting to take a little bit cable over time and make usages and things like time lapse features and and and not being afraid I mean there's been a lot of [ __ ] like wait what I'm looking right now I wasn't planning my place for a break I would be packing this outer video and who knows maybe you will get hacked out a video before it was either way YouTube I miss you guys I have to put up any real processing content in a while we got a Robin press video they did really good a couple months ago so let's see how we do with a little video press was a match took some nice big fat dad's an ass as you can see from the quality it is very very nice if you can really tell through the bag maybe you don't press a lot of rosy for dry sift very very yeah so I should mention if you're asking yourself or about 2.6 grams of oils in the first day how do you hold but yeah I just walked out it was it's not what I don't normally smoke in the morning anyway I would rather get I enjoyed the hi little more when I put it off for as long as possible and then of course I than that [Music] we're about twice this bag we're gonna go ahead and flatten it out a little bit a little bit of Liberty there it should not break our 15 micron bag inside of it what I what I'm saying is that I didn't pack this down as far as it could go I actually spread it out a little bit now I'm going to be careful to one of my scenes up this is my housing bag or support Thank You mrs. oh look at that paper anything smashed into eggs and it's great to Robyn all right since we're only gonna do a single press thank you know I like to make media moment watchable YouTube videos let me just make sure that my hands are on camera ok so I have my browsing data right here now when it's in the fat when it's in the press it will actually be like this but whatever this is the scenes nice and it seems a good indicator for how wide it needs to be so I like to leave between and eight to three eighths you could just say a quarter of an inch but I'm not a [ __ ] mover so it's not always that but anyway I'm going to the quarter mesh on each side and then fold it and then you fold it just pull it back on itself literally it so we're going to do that same thing to the other side go ahead and get it [Music] we working a little bit of room but the pecker matters are just going to flatten out so the idea is to make it flatten out and being able to work within the space that you have created here without you know breaking through the parchment or anything like that you know you don't want to pull it so tight fit I mean your thinking your mind if you if you bring in these brothers or these sides so far up you can just direct all around and forward and you can just hit such a cool shot yeah TV not really unfortunately if you do it too close you're just going to expand through to the size of your Robin Robin paper or parchment paper and another one that I mean missing some schisms that's how you say that right pretty sure [Music] now I am seeing about how much of the parchment paper my bags when they take up on there and then I'm going to go ahead and make some doing it cuts that number one make sure that I don't have to just barely sit my if you cut it right at the edge of the bag you're going to barely be able to sit your parchment inside your plates neck sensor so you need to to be able to put it back under place if you have a proper if you have a nice big size press if you have a smaller personal press then you may be you know you may want to cut it nice and tight so that you can utilize those the plate it's basically that before this again is my upgraded browsin New York for wrong the brush New York I mean 25,000 breasts big bad bad ass over here you can't see it with the stand alone pump it operates the age obviously is a pressure gauge that gives me an idea let me you know that's me very very systematic to step up and know exactly where I am pressing sometimes we're not pressing very much so we're not going to have that all night for more than five now this is where it takes kind of easy things some people choose to do their origami differently yes I call it origami at this point is really in my do you like it we can oppress the modeling or we were sitting on for part of my favorite of all but the whole reason for this I'll show you is because I'm going with you and this will this if and we'll see if it should be a well and if this crust should actually in sweet this will provide for something for you look at something nice for you and then put together think about pretty far there on my extra space with absolutely will see it might not you might not be very much at all you know see the way that's not really what's important at all my flash ladies have the garage so suck it just barely administered pressure just up and again this is just a very small personal hash-table impressed did not waver he's the 15 micron back and the 25 micron back to house it aside and that we did a directional pole so that hopefully any yoga we get will come out now that we've given it 30 seconds to heat it's not that hard of a patty I can also tell from my gauge that the patty inside of it [Music] [Music] you never really get anything good on these bras impress New York bras impressive I don't understand you know we're just a total ripoff what the [ __ ] ever what's this [ __ ] [Music] so what's that for me yeah and for the record I can only utilizing one to fix one day I had in my exposing and I'm such a low temperature as you can see it's buckling and layering on top of itself again so it looks like the alien sour apple times slur Canyon is that squish it she's a squirter that's so [ __ ] inappropriate you're just trying to maintain one ton of pressure that's all I'm doing I'm not even increasing just maining ones name's Danny one time we've only gone two minutes in progress right now and considering we are over to continue our press now I'm going to go ahead and like a PSI trusting and I've had enough displacement now it won't oh yeah Wow this place it's displacing so quickly Wow it's making these huge if this if I was pressing at a higher temperature it would run run run run run in yeah then you guys would be like oh wow but just to hear but I can barely maintain suit under the brush there just key every time I get up to two times it's the needle just because of the hash forcing you know just flying out a bag anyway we are almost we're just past three minutes into the press so I'm going to go ahead and see if I can approach Richman's 6000 psi on the clock or on the jacket you know we could figure out the platelet pressure by doing just a little bit of quick math with the area of the actual bag that were pressing then then of course using that as a vector against our four by seven plates the math is not that complex but I can't maintain fresh 3p a 2000 psi or right 6000 psi three times but we are four minutes in and I feel like I'm starting to see some discoloration so let's go ahead and call it I call it I'm going to get one quick ring out [Music] geez that didn't you about all I can tell from the field of the bag on the way now this is gonna be able total waste of time I don't know I don't know how well sarcasm gets through the queue but either way you know what Preston in New York rosin press tools that we have no spoon this is my collection of late that I of course keep in my freedom you can use your hand which is silly lots better to use you know anything else in any person to be honest with you sometimes I just like to sit for a second or two but just let it sit for a second or two and they just do this to be just to show the bottom and some low tariffs and then after that we just sandwich it because obviously that's going to force everything to maintain nice and cool that should be a little better and a lot but working with here but surviving at that country we open up our little present which I have archived frozen is shattering out love already oh that's hilarious so I like using those things man the place the collection would and yes this clearly looks like it has a nice second press left in it so we'll see it can either become one of those turds like I showed you at the beginning of the video or it may become coconut oil either way this Robin looks pretty good I'm not sweeper pump on the on you know this being its first press quality so we'll get a look at it after we get it together here it's of course all of it butters immediately almost there's some of it that's maintaining its fresh press consistency it is very very terrific [ __ ] reach you may remember I said at the beginning of the video and I think I even mentioned again this is one part sour apple or alien sour apple and the other parts lurking so call it what you I call it alien sour apple times work this just wonderful it's each of those strains or you know buzz and trend from each of those strings very very gently drive shifted at a nice low temp remain or bottoming these buzz a little more surgical all right you do look a little modernization twist up a little bit ah maybe we walk into that bucket I look pretty fire actually falling off camera there excuse you guys look at it good bad not bad so with that ladies and gentlemen I'd like you to say hello to the newest upgrade in the 710 extraction is arsenal my rosin fresh New York 20-ton rosin dress and yes I did get twin 20-ton presses so the next thing you get to see for me is a video on proper assembly and troubleshooting of 2010 because I'm going to set up my second one using this was a point of reference and then after that look out for maintaining your tent on rosin Press New York rosin breasts I have a new jack that I'm gonna swap out on that so we're gonna go ahead and document both of those processes and share them with all of you I hope you enjoy and I also hoped you enjoyed helping and watching you make that little bubble rosin right there maybe we'll call it sour King alien sour came out err the outer world soured out-of-this-world sour key have a great day guys hope you enjoyed the video", "oIgn1oCCSn4": "what's up guys it's groomer e4 here battling on their episode and I want to show you an easy way that you can extract trichomes from plant matter and this video is inspired by opus 420 a good friend of mine he's an awesome guy his video inspired me to make my own video on how to use a key box or how to make your own so what I've got is about 4 ounces of frozen trim and bud it's a good thing to freeze it beforehand that way the trichomes become more brittle and they're easy to fall off and the screen that i'm using is 120 micron silkscreen i got it at my local art store you can also use metals metal screen if you can find it and it's just a very easy way to get concentrates without using chemical solvents be chill and whatnot is becoming very popular and a big problem with that is people are trying to make it at home by themselves and that in itself is very dangerous it poses very a lot of risks including leaving solvents left behind in the leftover product and the possible risk of blowing yourself up and you shouldn't make butane hash oil unless you have a background in chemistry and organic chemistry to actually know what you are doing and there still needs to be a lot of research into canvas concentrates that use chemical solvents just yeah it's terrible reading the news and seeing somebody died in a beach hill explosion like one explosion is one too many deaths that's terrible we don't need that in our community and we have better ways to make it so let me stop rambling so what you want to get you don't want to do is of course freeze the trim for a few hours and oh yeah underneath my silk screen I have just a few pieces of wood just as spacers so they're above the table and I also have a piece of tempered glass it makes it much easier to scrape up that Keith and you're also gonna want a card I have my friend Corey for a business card just to help me out so and yes one man's trash is another man's treasure if you can possibly get your hands on trim at a very low price it's a great thing to take the advantage of because there's still a lot of trichomes left you're just gonna want a few handfuls and when you're using silkscreen you want to be very gentle especially with the small pieces of stems it can rip through that's why it is best to get an aluminum swing and you're gonna probably you're gonna want to gently brush it over for about ten minutes and I'm gonna put on my timer ten to fifteen minutes so we'll go for fifteen and a little history though hashish morocco produces actually nearly half the hashish smoked in the world spain has massive massive cannabis fields specially bred just for hash production and usually in in places like India and Afghanistan in Pakistan they would use indica strains because it's mostly known for its high resin content high trichome content and hashed hashes thousands of thousands of years old it's incredible it's just so fun to work with me it's actually working with a plant that can help you out [Applause] and of course doing this extraction won't extract 100% of the THC of the trichomes there will be small plant matter inside but you know I'd rather have residual plant matter than rich residual chemical solvents from beauty [Applause] and by getting shrimp from a local friend it's a good way to get some nice seeds [Applause] you find any small bugs just break it up you don't need to grind it beforehand or that will probably increase the plat matter that you'll get inside the benefits of making your own keep extraction is you can get very creative you can either make it simple setup like this where you're just moving it over the silk screens onto a glass top or you can make shakers I've seen people that have attached motors to the sides such as ones found in late video game controllers and that will automatically not that's pretty smart and you can also make a tumbler box there's one you can buy it's called the pollinator I believe marijuana has a video on it and it's a very effective machine but you can also make one yourself you stoners [ __ ] you guys are creative I feel a jump cut coming up all right so we're back 15 minutes has passed and let's see what you got first let's take out most of the tram just easier and let's see so like I said before there is going to be some small plant residual matter I'd rather have that chemical solvents Oh that's so Sears one man's trash is another man's treasure that's how you can easily extract trichomes from plant matter without using chemical solvents and I can't stress that enough we we there are let that up to the professionals please do not make canvas concentrates using chemical solvents at home it's very dangerous and that's why there are methods like these and you can do at home in a safe manner I don't want to hear any more [ __ ] explosions in the news that's scary so delicious delicious so hope you guys enjoyed the video and have a great day peace", "fEzgJdJaB4U": "[Music] hello everyone it's me the cannabis reviewer i'm back for another exciting week of grow but actually what we're doing is we're going to do some work on our fall grow sorry our summer grow summer 2020 grow that uh i have one more thing to do and i've had a request for it so i'm going gonna do it today i'm gonna try to do today if i get my gloves to work and that is take the sugar leaves and the and the small buds because i got impatient and make some kush out of it not cush well make some keep out of it i should say and i think it's pretty much dry now and ready to go so let's look at it and let's see what we got so it's pretty dry so it's not too exciting [Music] kind of grind it up best you can try to work out those trikes still these still might not be dry enough we're going to keep trying though and hopefully we get somewhere with it it still smells a little green there are buds in here too they're probably not completely dry sticks a little bit everything in here boy you can smell it and see you can already see there's a keef right there there's a lot here so i like to really try to grind it up really as fine as i can because it seems to help get those trikes off and uh it's a process i don't know if you get all of it or not it's but it's something that i do because waste not want not i always feel if we can get some keef out of it why not go ahead i can smell it's [ __ ] got some smell to it see and i still got some buds look at this [ __ ] bud right there maybe i'll pull some of these i got impatient i admit i probably could have had a little better yield if i'd taken my time not got impatient but it is what it is and that's all i can say about that grind it up grinder up grind the grinder grinder up and this continue the process i haven't even looked yet to see how much i got if i even got any but i feel like i have some because you can see how that's getting brown right there that's usually a good sign making sweet noise boy you can really smell those oh wow that smells good i sure hope i'm getting some good good powder good trikes going through there a lot of sugar leaves there were a lot of sugar leaves a few small buds two yeah i may let these dry a little longer i don't know let's see where we're at [ __ ] little tiny bud little tiny buds guys yeah i [ __ ] got in a hurry definitely some of this shit's just [ __ ] some of it's buddy put that back over here let's see oh yeah look at that keith see that we're doing great guys that is how you make it patience just you know keep on keeping on grind it squeeze it move it around knock off those trikes see if you can try to get them pushed through the screen try to keep it on the goddamn uh cookie sheet that would help i will uh not force you all to sit here and watch me do this for 10 [ __ ] minutes i'll be doing this for a while so i'll come back after i'm pretty much done and we'll see where we're at with the amount of keefe that i got god damn it gotta stay on there anyway be right back all right i'm back i'm done with the grinding basically i just take my hand and i just go and just keep going and keep going and keep going and keep going and keep going probably doing it for 15 minutes now straight i took a couple breaks but pretty much straight so what's it look like when you're done mostly looks like this the more you grind i would expect the more trikes you can get out of it so it's up to you on how far you want to go with it for me that's good enough what we want to see did i get any keith at all that or not let's see let's see why yes i [ __ ] did and look at the bottom of that i don't know if we can even get to it let me see if i can get down to it we'll dump it there's a bunch of keef i might be a bunch of keef might also be just the weed i'm going to scrape off the top as well or the bottom i mean of the screen but as you can see it's looking good okay i'll be back it's hard for me to do right here uh i'll be back and uh clean up this throw this in the trash and uh we'll show you what we got for the keefe be right back hello everyone i'm back it's time now to show you what i got done i scraped it out of the pan put it all together and this is what we got [Music] look at all that beautiful keef didn't that something nice look how crumbly it is watch it's all in chunks beautiful so we'll be smoking that tonight definitely either in a bowl a joint or maybe i'll pull out the old bong hit it right we got a pay-per-view event tonight on ufc or ufc pay-per-view event tonight we're going to be watching can't wait for that so uh yeah it is saturday of course you guys probably know it's uh the 26th of september this is the basically the final stage of the 2020 summer grow minus smoking the pot finish the cure everything else is pretty much done i do appreciate y'all coming to my channel watching my videos i'm doing them in spurts you can see here and there as i get time i i'll try to get them done because i also work thank you all for watching my videos please like subscribe click the bell tell a friend post a comment below that'd be awesome i'd like to see those subscription numbers keep going up please tell your friends please keep subscribing please keep coming back this is the cannabis reviewer and as i always say happy smoking", "mLdir-jTbm4": "mm-hmm all right guys I'm letting the press preheat and preheating the wax as well the puck of rosin of um hash this is bubble hash five grams and I'm just a slight pressure on there very little whatever is leaking out now it's just just pre oil from if I press it too fast it'll blow the bag out and it'll contaminate the rest of all of the rosin with the hash so I'm trying to just squeeze it slow and low like I said the temps I have was a little bit high usually I do about 180 175 I might drop this back down to 175 just because I don't want to put too much heat to the rosin I'm not trying to decarboxylate it I'm just trying to press it out of the out of the 25 micron bag that I'm using as a filter you can see it's already starting to pour out pretty decent like I said I haven't put any pressure on this yet but as soon as I do it's all gonna come out gushing like I said low and slow that's the way to do it to get the best quality rosin and this was hashed I've actually had sitting around for about a month it's just been sitting around just I haven't really been needed to use it till now so I'm gonna make me some rosin to smoke on not that I don't have any rosin but did for something different different profile different THC content everything is different every time unless you're running the same exact strings on all times me I'm always constantly running different strains and we're hitting 170 and 175 on the top and bottom plate so I can pretty much put all the pressure I need on it now and it should all start I mean out and as you can see it's pretty decent it's a little darker because like I said I've had this hatch sitting around for quite a while I didn't put it in the fridge or anything I just let it laying around so it's completely ready to rock and roll it's a pretty good glove if you ask me and you can see it's all coming out on the sides as well this is all just for personal use total press time on this is probably maybe three minutes maybe if that and I started out the temp at like 69 70 degree temperature just whatever the plates were when I started it up and just continued to put the put the puck in there and started just light pressure like I said until I started adding pressure and it all came out it's all ready to come out now as a matter of fact I was allowed - I've put all the pressure I could on it before I either rip the paper or do something stupid so [Music] give me one second I'll show you guys what it looks like alright guys this is what it looks like after the fact I did have a little tiny blowout right there in this corner right there a little bit I must have blew out this corner right here but the rest of it is pretty clean i'll see any contaminants other than a little tiny bit right here which i'll just it doesn't matter to me i'm gonna smoke it either way but everything else looks and pletely clean smells [ __ ] amazing until you get right there get down to the piece like I said it's separate it's just like pressing a bud just couldn't clean around and get the best you can the filter bags like I said especially when you go into pressing hash it's a it's it's all concentrate and it's all oils so you're gonna get way more than you would if you were to press flour and it heats up a lot faster because it's not as much material in the way as far as plant matter it's just hash and that's it and try Coneheads and lipids and whatever else is in there but yeah that's pretty much it guys and then these hash bags you can save them and press them again or you can you can just save them and once you get a good amount of them you can make butter or or edibles out of it you just drop them in a crock pot with some butter and that the whole bag everything and then it'll dissolve in the oil and it'll separate the oil from the whatever else is left in there as far as whether you're planting pressing plant matter or hash it doesn't make a difference then you sift it out with the cheesecloth and you can use that oil for anything it's gonna be decarboxylated and ready to rock and roll you can put it in brownies you can put it in cooking you can make tinctures you can learn about tinctures but you can make pretty much anything with edible wise tinctures I'm not sure how that would work I think you got to use the actual oil without any butter in there cuz I the way I'm telling you to do is use a unsalted butter or you can use salted it doesn't matter and then you just put about a half a pound of butter with with a quarter pound of chips or rosin pucks or however you doing it the more pucks you have the stronger it's going to be alright guys I'm gonna go ahead and cut this video off it's getting a little long so have a good day be safe and I stay medicated", "06maWSlZQcM": "hey everyone Eric with pure pressure here just going to help you select which bags you want to use when your press and rosin got a couple different bags down here we have everything that allows you to press from Keith to bubble on the 36 micron end of the spectrum 70 to 90 and then the 115 s better for flour to get started got some gloves and get these ready so I've got our quick flip tool here anytime you're pressing with a bag you always want to turn it inside out so you have this easy little tool you just slide it right on the end here put it through and then press it down I'm going to press out the corners and the reason that you want to turn it inside out is that you don't you don't want any blowouts so now I've got my bag inside out my corners are all pressed I'm ready to go so today we're going to be pressing some Cinderella 99 cross with the white this is a great strain we really think it's going to yield quite a bit put that in my tray you have just about a quarter of an ounce here that we're going to pack up so we get a lot of people talking to us and they're asking should I grind this up before I put it in the bag how do I do that we don't actually recommend that you do because then you're getting trichomes that are in your grinder or wherever you're processing it I'm going to take these Nuggets and I'm going to put them straight in the bag and then break them up so take these put it right in start breaking this up with my hands so again not grinding before I'm putting it in the bag I'm kind of breaking it up with my hands in here already so one thing when you're packing these bags is that you really want to make sure that you don't have any big stems in there so if you're pressing some material that happens to have big prominent stems you're going to want to pick those out what you can see now is I'm actually just working this down to the bottom of the bag and I'm trying to fill it out and make it as even as possible so any gaps or spaces that you have in your bag that's where your oil is going to get trapped so is what I'm trying to do is I'm just breaking this up with my fingers filling it out making sure it's nice and even you could definitely fit more than a quarter ounce in one of these six inch bags and with the nine inch bags you can get just under an ounce its evened out so here we've got our bag it's just about ready to go now one thing that I'm going to do here is I'm going to put down and I'm going to put some pressure on it because you want to pack this as tight as it's going to go ahead of time so that when you actually start pressing all the oil has the right path to come right out of the bag got a little extra space here at the end so is what I'm going to do take a pair of scissors and cut off so I have just about an inch at the top there we go cool so I've got a little bit here at the top a little bit of space and then when we're ready to press is what you're going to want to go ahead and do is flip this over before you slide it in so you have a nice little envelope so here we go here is our bag it is ready to press so this is ready to go as soon as we're ready to press we'll go on over you", "AORyULfIRe0": "yo yo yo what's good youtube welcome to another live stream i'm going to raise you up just a bit sweet so gopro updated and um my new wi-fi router is in we're showing signal strength here for the stream decent it didn't show that before so now that's pretty good to see anyways let me go ahead and share the link out to instagram and we're going to go ahead and get started uh all right cool well glad we got that up and running let me go ahead and uh get this stream up on my computer oh you're right let's see i'm sure you guys want to see some of this stuff that i have here before we even get started right let me show you what we got going on first of all we weighed everything out earlier we uh pulled it out of the freeze dryer fresh this morning fat fat nineteen point four percent yield killed it one thousand one hundred and thirty grams of nug went in 220 grams of full spectrum hash came out as well as 19 grams of 25 and 160 micron so this is our test press that we use for edibles and then we'll go ahead and press out the rest of these full spectrum pucks i loaded them by hand into the bags and then after putting them in the bags i pressed them down in a rosin evolution pre-press to make sure that they stayed nice and tight and they are evenly distributed went up from uh the small little four ounce jars and uh upgraded to the six ounce jars i got tired of filling those little small ones to the brim and i said it's time to upgrade baby so we got the jar all weighed out we'll be able to weigh this when we're done tonight and see what our final yield was on this run now i'm a big fan of doing my presses a little bit warmer than what most people would i'm using my stool for you guys today so i'm gonna do this but um yeah you guys that watch me often know i will press anywhere from 200 to 225 depending on the cultivar depending on the hash um not all hash comes out the same um for example we talked about trichome density before right we talked about just because it looks like a lot of hash it may not be a lot of hash because um the oil inside may not be full you know what i'm saying the trichome may just be partially full in that case it's fluffy hash where it looks like a lot but it doesn't weigh a lot that's why this 25 micron and this 160 micron it looks like a large puck but it only weighs 19 grams compared to this puck which is smaller in comparison by about a centimeter right and it's not as fat but it weighs more probably about five to six grams more and that's because this is the full spectrum 45 through the 159 which contains higher density trichomes that are full of milk oil compared to the 25 and 160. so just a little throw that in there for you interior genetics what's going on asteroid farms if you guys aren't following asteroid farms on instagram go follow so old homie of mine platinum grove colorado who used to have a really pimp-ass girl room the nasa lab right um one of the inspirations for me initially stepping up my garden well now it's his turn to come back and he just got a brand new house with a nice ass basement and guess what it's time for a brand new build out so we're gonna help each other out take some ideas off of each other and i'm basically gonna have him record the whole thing and um show you guys how he does his build out you know and he'll give you guys pointers along the way and uh you know show you how to build a grow room so by the time you know he's done with that uh build out i'll be done uploading my video on how when i built out my grow room and uh his will be pretty much part two of a series that i'm going to be doing where it's going to be either build-outs brand new or remodels or upgrades and you guys will be able to pay for each episode um individually and absorb all the information that went into that whole build or remodel so it was actually his idea and we're gonna do his build out as episode two so it's gonna be awesome it's gonna have amazing information in there and it's gonna be great for you guys because instead of just seeing my room all the time and you're like oh that's great but not everybody has your room like yours or not everybody has a layout like yours you'll get to see different layouts different places different um climates right you're gonna get to see it all and you're gonna get to see the different thought process that goes into building these so it's gonna be really cool but anyways go check out his instagram because he's already started posting updates on it and it's not often that you get to jump on board and watch it build out brand new from the start most of the time you hop in and it's like uh the person's halfway done they've already done a bunch of [ __ ] you kind of like feel like the new guy you know what i'm saying in a crowd of old guys that been around for a long time now's your chance to get in on the bottom floor be one of those old guys he's been there forever by the time he gets done finishing you could be like i was there when you were still drawing the blueprints yo whippersnapper some of this blue icy and then i'm going to glove up the press is set to 175. we're going to do a low temp press on our test bag it's not going to be a clear indication of how the full spectrum is going to respond but it's going to give me a good enough idea to know whether or not 175 is going to provide the flow i'm looking for or if i'm going to need to go up to my 204 temperature 202 maybe i will put a link up right now i'm not sure that you guys can do it that's what's up jinder mah what's up dude i haven't seen you in forever holy moly so yeah check out asteroid farms what's going on viper what's up slug upstate what's going on we're just giving everybody a minute to trickle on in taking dabs we're enjoying life i haven't even taken a dab with you guys yet have i ah let's take a dab i'm gonna go in on some of this blue icy first oh let's get in there who wants to get in those guts with me we've got 31 left on this battery oh let's get in there the gopro doesn't focus well close up so you guys are gonna take what you get and be happy all right first time catching a live stream viper you caught a very good live stream for your first live stream this whole live stream i've already prepped all my parchment i prepped all my bags normally i'm not this prepped normally i still have full parchment and [ __ ] i wiped down the plates i'm ready to go baby it's waiting on you guys i mean what do you think we're about to press a half pound of hash a half pound cheers at 413 on the email okay ah that blue icy i swear on the exhale it tastes just like a blue icy it is so crazy every time it never fails what's up easy labs green ranger nashville how you doing freshly pressed what's up annie oh gee what's up hidden creek we got the whole [ __ ] family here i think i'm gonna do a live stream prank and start a live stream pressing hash with the hair straightener so we can get a million people asking oh no what happened did the press break fantastic so huh all righty all righty all righty let's swap out the battery you already know we got it we gotta swap out the battery we don't want it to die it'll be another short live stream i had to find it i couldn't forget i couldn't remember where the [ __ ] i put it down now i can't remember which batteries are charged now let's see lucky number nothing they'd be lying sometimes you got to pull them out and pop them back in they're not lying tonight [ __ ] [ __ ] well one of you's got to be higher than 25 [ __ ] percent let's find out i i don't feel comfortable knowing i've got 25 percent left on the battery i just took a fat ass dab and i'm about to start pressing i'm gonna get excited forget and this is gonna die by the way if the stream does go down unexpectedly please stay tuned because i will bring it right back up this is a non-stop party tonight that battery was at 100 you [ __ ] lying ass charger all right all right so for those of you that are new here i do a [ __ ] ton in a very small space so this is where i'm going to be collecting at when i'm all done here okay we're gonna move some [ __ ] out of the way shout out to roz and inc i want you guys to look at something real close here custom product for who that is who has bags like that who has bags like that do you want to know why he carries these two and a half by four and a half bags hey cuz of me baby who wants some bags i know some of you press and some of you need some bags all right anyways we've got parchment laid out we've got our bags ready to go okay and here you guys are going to go you're going to go right here look at that just for you how's that view yeah you could just chill set you down now is a good time if you got to use the restroom you got to go grab a drink you know what i'm saying whatever you got to do go handle that let me figure out this lighting i don't want it to be too bright for you guys oh [ __ ] that's too bright all right i feel good about this you guys are ordering from rosin inc make sure you guys use my coupon codes they're on my site solventlessbnb.com let's get ready get up there get up there just a little love from my homie right there you know all right remember you guys we're gonna be doing the 160 micron and the 25 micron mixed together as a test press before we move on to the full spectrum presses here we have the uh [ __ ] puck come on turn on screen doesn't recognize my gloves oh well anyways i hope that you guys were able to see that now this uh this is just some uh edibles mix of some uh the last strain that i pressed out which is the grape cosby little dark but it is [ __ ] chirpy and delicious and it will do amazing for edibles because the flavor that it will add is not too over the top but it's definitely like you notice it notice it so we're going to drip this into that edibles jar this is probably not going to flow crazy this is a test press a low temp test press at 175 all right i honestly feel like i should go up a little so so so so oh that looks like it's gonna be good well i think i found the temperature i'm gonna try for the first full spectrum maybe it'll flow a little bit more i'll take it for edibles siezer um don't worry that was just a plate on top of the press jumping around my cold plate up there good extraction well the flow was okay wasn't quite what i want it's kind of a weird flow so all right well not quite what i'm looking for believe it or not 185 that's gonna give me that awkward drip i'm gonna hold pull my audience to see what you guys think the temperature is that i'm gonna go with i already know what i'm going with i'm gonna go with uh my usual all right well we're gonna go ahead and do the first full uh spec press now all the same size that one was at 175. small bag we'll do this one first oh jesus 224 no too high 202 202 202 that's that's where i'm feeling 202 today i can feel it in my huevos rancheros pressing some cool spectrum once cash baby all right the room temperature is 74 degrees i do not believe in running a cold room during the pressing stage now bear with me you guys this is going to be a tad bit awkward as i have to deal with not only the um press this new jar which is larger and doesn't sit on the edge so i have to hold it like this in fact i don't even know what your viewpoint is now does that make sense right there where it's at for you guys i mean all right here we go we're at 191.1 191.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 six that's how slow my press heats up i love it i don't care what anybody says it doesn't overshoot temperatures during pressing because it sleeps it heats up slowly it doesn't like jump up all crazy because it has some overpowered 150 to 200 watt heaters it just has two 100 watt heaters nicely spaced out let's take a dab again next time tomorrow it sounds delicious this [ __ ] is like caramel taffy uh oh uh oh ah excuse me i felt like my nose was gonna run all over camera i didn't want that oh yeah what's up mommy my [ __ ] that'll do good that'll do oh that gets the job done i'll tell you what how you guys feeling about this prize we're at 199.7 199.7.8.9 200. 201 i'm not there and dad just [ __ ] knock me on my ass about let's get ready to remove look at that still plenty of paper towel left to clean bangers with throw that away save that puffing my man it's a good night when my boy puffin comes to visit you're pressing yourself right now huh hell yeah get it dog we are warmed up to 202 degrees let's go this is gonna be a second test press slightly lower than my normal but for some reason i'm feeling this temperature why i saw gonza say 204 and i'm like yeah yeah that's my normal i feel it but then all of a sudden my balls rumbled and spoke to me from deep within and they said no 202 now they're all right [ __ ] it the balls haven't lied yet oh what would you look at that there already me gusta come here come to daddy a little [ __ ] go what i say i knew it i felt it i felt it in my huevos rancheros oh yeah let's get messy somebody's got to make a meme out of the next big bag that squirts all over this jar so i'm feeling good about that that's a fish grab that and we're gonna move this over here i'll turn you right now 202 my [ __ ] i want to know did i get it all did i oh man that was a beautiful extraction 202 good job balls sometimes it's in your brains sometimes it's in your balls tonight it was in my balls oh check your insta i just saw you let me see let's let's see what am i checking your story i don't know maybe i jumped in at the wrong part of that conversation oh elevated uh nah there wasn't a lot on the parchment there was barely anything in here really maybe like two to three grams that was a small piece of uh that was small and that was 19 grams in there and uh [ __ ] dude not a lot left in there it's all over the [ __ ] sides of this jar is where it's at you guys want to see a big squirt huh all right let's get it gotta get off this cyber dream stuff though um all right let's get it big old fatty this one feels like a 27-30-ish somewhere in there all right let's go i don't want to listen to trap sorry i gotta get i gotta get the right music on first this is bothering me put on some good old tj hotto all right let's go i'm gonna fold this one down the center i just pinch it crease it down the center diagonal the other diagonals and that gives you kind of like a good flow right there already and then you just pinch the sides together and it's like let me check my battery here 85 percent go dude i'm all smoking one squeeze okay shout out to my man mysticalgo my official artist on sbnb records back down oh yep bomb extraction on that one let's go cross mountain ranges split cells of tomorrow it flowed so well there's like not even that much on the paper let us go yes uh let's keep this party [ __ ] going good over here peace i think i put some information in the description maybe i didn't add that i guess but 25 micron double bag from rosin inc for the uh for the bags my bad y'all i tried to put some information in there and i left out that one yo if you guys can't catch the live streams sign up for my patreon i upload them there so come to daddy um is i'm the master of my own fate i determine my own yield i grew the flowers this is the source of the single i am my own god excuse you uh is that's why i keep the ends of these parchment pieces wrap them over the parchment paper i wish i could slow this down listen listen did you [ __ ] catch it though my man [ __ ] threw it in putting him on game yo understand he let y'all know i'm putting y'all on game for free i'm gonna i'm gonna take it back one time is it too loud uh um let's go ladies and gentlemen it's time to flow i'm gonna bring you guys back some i feel like i'm not bad hold on you guys don't really need that flashlight i don't think anyways let me take it off and passed wrench squad hold it down here's a pro tip on really fat pucks make sure you leave a little extra space behind the puck so that you don't get a blowout but i can mute it that's fine didn't need that light but i'm not liking how that's lining up on the [ __ ] plates i'm gonna move it over just a tad real quick like uh is i go go go go go real big extraction what is it [ __ ] this one's really done i'm calling it now it's gonna be a dumper is nobody [ __ ] with you you know what as a kid i actually did like origami and [ __ ] you know what was better than origami paper [ __ ] planes god damn it paper planes with a [ __ ] i could fold all types of paper planes you guys when i was a kid not now you know why i can't do it now because i lost the book i didn't look that [ __ ] up read that [ __ ] in the book you know what i mean books are cool as [ __ ] you can learn how to make paper airplanes and [ __ ] who would have thought mm-hmm starting to get good at this [ __ ] so um okay well brown is foreign i until you quit this next one's gonna squirt like a [ __ ] so um okay i have that camera ready i'm gonna record this one on my phone i'm not sure how i'ma do it watch me money money all the time hey money please no worries it's only 200 degrees touch it with your [ __ ] hands that sense sorry i'm trying to align this a little bit differently here safety reasons there it is my press has a ram that can adjust positions so um it's a little bit different than most the ram isn't stationary which means that it can come out of alignment sometimes if i move it or whatever but it's all we're helping to make good taking care of your summer projects is a breeze bam summer savings on all your favorite brands make things even easier so freshen up the deck and fire up the grill summer's here and it's as close as your home yard get more done let's get it i've used this prosper [ __ ] ever you're biking like five years now i just let go of the [ __ ] bar my bad you guys the camera is on a very unsteady amount kinda i don't have the tripod leg spread out very well all right is to the place whoa the puck slit in the plates when i was adjusting it apparently almost popped out of the front no blow out though but i gotta pull it out real quick and readjust it i'm so glad that didn't blow out but somehow that slipped out that's a trip i'm so happy that i didn't blow out that's crazy what the [ __ ] i've never had that happened that's a trip that's a trip son experience saved for real he wouldn't would he he [ __ ] would let's go back on the plates you go you son of a [ __ ] that was a trippy trip trippy trip trip this thing is about i was like why is it not going like it should be leaking way more and then all of a sudden the handle slipped and i was like what the [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] what happened put that back on the plate for a second up a let that so hmm who's your daddy who's your daddy what a safe uh is before oh yeah good extraction i'll take it oh yeah let's power through it two more to go parchment gets added to the jar everything i want everything together mixed together equal even steven the stuff that sticks to the parchment might be different terpenes might be different different [ __ ] you know you don't want to leave it out shop from the comfort of your home at sprint.com that's not a lot of work bro i know i'm saying it's already time to upgrade the jar again i just got this damn jar i'm upset it's not fun i thought for sure it was going to be good enough we knew get a bigger drawer uh bertha it's time to go squirtle what the [ __ ] it did it again something's going on here is it sliding something's happening here there's no blowout but it's sliding off pressure's not being applied evenly to the plates somehow or they're too tight or i pre-packed them at an angle never had this happen okay i know what i'm about to do fix this i'm going to have to increase the pressure even slower every problem there is a solution hmm leaned on him to apply pressure for the pre-press by doing it evenly i had to have been time to upgrade and put my bigger plates on i guess for these bigger presses right inside there i hope you guys are watching this if you guys aren't [ __ ] paying attention i don't know what you're doing right now when i mess up that's when you guys need to pay attention because i don't mess up very often not to sound cocky whatsoever but i don't so if i make a mistake that's resulting in some type of mess up it would benefit everybody around me to pay attention and realize what i'm doing wrong so i got my light that's fine before i make sure i got the jar underneath there i didn't think it was going to squirt like that still this parchment is heavy from the [ __ ] first part of the press but it's still flowing good that's all that matters and no blowout fan dumb strong on the top setting don't you get a damn hum my curl is my rocker maybe i choose you and i don't even have i don't even have um i have a couple theories for what it is lots of adjusts right now it's increasing pressure too fast and also i have the press at a a pretty good angle right now leaning towards the front and i think that the hash is melting and making the puck inside uneven and then it blows out the front like that so i think i'm just going to go ahead oops just hit the table i'm going to go ahead and flatten out the press a little bit more risky with this puck anymore how would i do on the save [ __ ] crazy giving her incredible so okay my battery at 34 okay um check the alignment of the plates one more me come on gloves don't stupid i know it's not that cold in here but then mm-hmm little 74 degrees in here oh missiles contemplating life changes foreign foreign let me grab some parchment hold on i got an idea not so much as an idea that i just want to do something for this press just insurance actually all okay searching for savings on descriptions is so complex it's like getting a documentary unfortunately you just savings period not all patients eligible savings so um me yes i haven't even hit one ton of pressure you guys think i'm kidding look so just hit two and a half oh figured it out right pressure was increasing too fast and the angle probably didn't know so so well aren't you guys glad i got the internet connections really good attraction well wow please so um batteries are charged let's get a battery swap in before we do anything else we'll go from there sound good oh think so okay all right so good job bertha good job baby we're gonna take a dab and then after this dab i'm going to um go ahead and collect what's on the parchment and get it added to the jar while it's still warm man that's heavy that's heavy i mean yield wise i'm thinking it's got to be it's got to be upwards of 80 it has to be you know there's it is no [ __ ] way it's not it's a little harsh didn't it that's okay i'll turn it down i knew there was a little [ __ ] nap thingy in here a little [ __ ] flew right on me else we know there's never a good time to run out of fresh luckily our delivery and free pickup excuse me so whether it's a few extra guns from the back all right i mean you can't help it i got lights on in here when i come in through the garage little [ __ ] just came in with me i guess oh boy oh what are we taking a dab off i mean this is the 160 and 25. this [ __ ] is looking better than some people's like 90s come on man this is my throwaway edibles what's your calling air force reserve af reserve dot com all righty i got the drugs already got a little bit of runs on here i'm gonna grab some more though on the outside of one of these parchments but i smeared i know there's like a bunch on the outside i could take so i don't have to dip into the jar or anything i'm i'm weird right now you're like call that fresh press man i wish i'll give you a melt so like wood that's runs wow wow that flavor is intense now that i haven't dabbed it in a while in a while holy [ __ ] it is intense um hitter hitter hitter hitter hitter goodness q-tip foreign all right fire all right here we go we're gonna collect the rest uh i don't have a tool i can even stick that far down into the jar to reach the bottom that's being 100 you guys want to get the girls so all right all right all right all right hash dust all over there packing the bags so all right you guys i'm going to turn up the music and i'm probably going to space out a little bit i have the chat right behind the camera though so i can see what you guys are saying and i will talk to you guys so

and in this one I'm about to attempt three bowls and under or around 45 seconds because yesterday was a failed challenge but I mean we did finish the five bowls that's all that really matters fail or pass guys you just really had to finish all the weed there's always the goal obviously as it's smokin but today we're going for 45 seconds three bowls that's two less than yesterday 15 seconds less so I'm hoping this one's a little bit easier but of course I had to make a challenging so I did pack these bowls pretty fast especially the last one of course so this is a challenge has to be somewhat challenging and I'll talk to that I have a little bit of a surprise I'm gonna be issuing this challenge out to 204 greenery the reason being is because I saw on your green crack video that your magnifying glass broke and check this out bro i am i have these unredeemed of points from work right and I couldn't find [ __ ] that I wanted on the website but the thing is is that the hey they have the exact magnifying glasses with lights for really cheap like I have so many points I could probably buy like [ __ ] twelve of them so I'm down this [ __ ] to buy you one and send it to you but over in Canadia if you respond to this an attempt this passer failed just you gotta respond and I'll send you one of those magnifying glasses that you just said you broke just randomly thought of it while I was high and I figured I might as well help you out since I can't find anything that I liked they have my camcorders and [ __ ] all kinds of stuff but yeah I mean ultimately there's nothing I really need and you said in your video that you broke it I noticed that that's a really key thing in your strainer videos so and then if you respond it's all yours whoo let's get her done enough talking three Bulls in under 45 seconds guys Cheers whoo all right I think we did it mm-hmm a43 the ball got a little snug so didn't I catch dude but I do believe that I killed the Greens at least for the most part oh so there you have it once more I think on this level three pools in one breath I mean not one breath um in under 45 seconds please be sure to do so with maximum effort guys you saw yesterday that we don't always you know actually follow through with completing these challenges but I mean it's up to us whether we you know keep moving order get discouraged by a simple mishap you know I actually did this one real satisfied with it I'm high as [ __ ] and I hope you guys enjoy it I'll sit here recover a little bit with you guys miss the 204 greenery I'll be waiting for your response especially if you want to see that magnifying glass bro there's a little random thing I thought of when I was watching your videos I hit you up directly on IG to actually talk to you about it I think you actually just responded while I started making the video oh yeah man I mean I figured it'd be cool I was like I said going through the website and find [ __ ] that I wanted everything that I wanted was way too offensive like I'd have enough points to get it and I mean the only way we accumulated points really was just showing up to work I had no idea I had it today I looked at what I thought was a lot of points but not enough he got all the [ __ ] I want but definitely down to come up on some of those magnifying glass a couple other little thing uh-oh No I hope you guys enjoyed going down in the comments let me know what you guys think subscribe if you haven't already give this video a thumbs up if you did enjoy if you didn't get your fix go check out my other videos on this channel there's plenty of them there's plenty of crazy hits there's lots of strain reviews a lot of close-ups on beautiful beautiful strains a lot of funny collabs with my homies that always have me laughing yeah I'm pretty [ __ ] stone hope you guys are too whoa but until next time I'm baked with you for twenty guys have a good one keep a smile on your face", "1Xc5LZgOtZo": "now i'll warn you it's um a little in my opinion uh you're warning me now well yeah because it'll go out but yours hasn't gone out so i'm glad it hasn't i will tell you that it's a creeper and that you will think that um you are at a certain level but it will creep on you what fun [Music] do [Music] hey everybody welcome to high rollers i'm your host derek gilman and together we are going to explore the world of cannabis connoisseurship the tools the techniques the rituals we're gonna get into the nitty-gritty we're gonna geek out on all these details and have a good time and consume while we're doing it uh joining us today on our journey it's a good friend of mine mr niels anderson niels is joining us today to discuss old school techniques old school genetics neil has been consuming uh cannabis since the mid 70s and he's just got a lot of great stories to tell and some techniques and a few hacks uh welcome to high rollers neil it's good to be here so good to have you man so um just let's i'm gonna describe to the audience how you and i met because i think it's a fun little story effectively we both here live in ventura county and we were trying to lobby the county to be a little more progressive in its uh and its cannabis regulations unfortunately as we both know ventura county is a little bit uptight when it comes to cannabis regulation and especially here in the state of california where it's supposed to be legal now right very conservative yeah and so uh we both belong to uh the vcca now defunct vcca which was the ventura county cannabis alliance and this was an advocacy group that was trying to lobby the county board of supervisors effectively into doing the right thing and while we weren't successful in that one of the great things that came out of this was getting to meet you niels you i think had approached me initially to say hi um and then we just kind of started chatting a little bit and one of the first things that you mentioned meals that just perked up my attention is you said hey you know i've been growing cannabis now since uh you know early mid 70s i've been doing it all to myself you know niels goes on to tell me how effectively he had gotten a hold of some tie stick back in the 70s amongst some other genetics as well and had been replicating those genetics keeping them pure unlike most breeders over these last few decades who have been crossing this with that niels the purest here uh kept the thai stick pure kept the malawi pure kept the hawaiian pure and uh and as soon as he mentioned this i was just blown away man and i just knew i had to get to know you better it was a fun interaction when we first met i think it's not an area where i've had the opportunity to socialize to do what we're doing now to to share our experiences but also i didn't realize at the time how unique that i just happened to grow up in santa monica happened to be at the right place at the right time and got to experience uh i believe the finest of all the the cannabis that came in imported and the reason why was because it was really consumed not only by the musicians and the rock bands but really by the groupies and they would they wanted the best and they wanted as much as they could get their hands on and i just happened to be lucky enough to be there and you traveled in some in some unique circles that actually granted you access to some of the finer herb that was flowing through southern california at the time right i was very lucky i had family friends whose parents were entertainment attorneys that seemed to acquire the product and this was a whole other time you know this was 40 50 years ago you go on to you know start collecting these different varieties as you're sampling them right you know i named a couple like the thai and the hawaiian and the malawi um and you're and you're saving these seeds through the process right i am but what also is unique is that it's always sativa most people do not want to bother with growing sativa first off it uh does not typically yield the large dense buds in that uh also it takes much longer to flower maybe even upwards of a month so it's just not attractive for somebody that's growing for product i never was i was growing always to supply a medication for a condition that i had that cannabis worked beautifully for and i was raised in a very conservative environment so i grew in a little two foot by three foot closet or actually a metal cabinet and when i got really brave i got two cabinets and then for 50 years now okay half a century you've almost you've effectively been an island unto yourself needed to be uh my work uh my thinking was very conservative and it just wasn't smart to seek out companionship in that dealing with cannabis at that time it was still misunderstood by the really the masses by the general population it was specifically a medication for me but a very important one because without it uh there was no medication and to this day there's no medication for a condition that i have um you were also highly involved in the scientific community um you were involved with some uh some amateur rocket uh research i believe right very much so in 1940 almost every state had an amateur rocket society but then they kept combining going out of business and that or losing interest whatever membership and there was only one reaction research society that stayed active and i felt very strongly about it to the point where when i joined there were three members when i left as president there were 700 and some odd amazing few of those members are some names i think our audience might recognize as well right well let's just say that there's quite a few people on spacex that will smile when they hear about uh this wonderful organization which is still in existence and you're a little modest and you don't like the name names but effectively uh elon musk uh was was part of your group right the guy he came to the rrs and we had a course uh where people would come out and build solid propellant rockets and they were all part of this course and now my interest is in medical cannabis because so many family and friends can benefit from the municipal medicinal properties of it [Music] you brought the tie you brought the hawaiian and you brought what's this third one you brought um this is um acapulco gold and this is a whole nother story uh it is a fascination of mine and the only thing on my bucket list that's how good my life has been my one thing on my bucket list is what is it that changes acapulco gold to gold and i was looking forward to isn't the genetics because you've been growing this out now and it's not turning gold absolutely in in fact this is my theory it wasn't unique to acapulco gold i think it's unique to any sativa grown anywhere in the right conditions first off the acapulco gold both santa marta both of them were mature perfect buds in other words that's one thing we don't talk about nowadays and if there were anything to learn from today's conversation it's in harvesting they never cut the cannabis plant and hung it up in a barn or anything like that it was always dried in the ground in other words they waited until the stock would rattle or whatever their nuance was when they walked through the field and then they would individually pull that particular plant up because it would be dried and i think it's the sitting in the ground drying out under the sun that's kind of bleaching out some of those chlorophylls that might be residual in there and i hope someday to learn what it is because several times i thought i was going really close there i i was almost sure i even remember calling derek derek i think i got it i think i got it i got he called me up on the phone real excited i've solved the code why don't you tell us a little bit about some of the tools and techniques you've learned over this time because i know you've got some stuff you want to share here with us well if i may i'll get into it kind of quick and then maybe we need to have something that i can show these tools how they're used i'm getting ready to start smoking here myself and if i may real quick uh marishum is uh sea foam it is a mineral naturally occurring in turkey um it's this white material and it's like mineralized it's like fossilized sea foam exactly so exactly so but what's really what drew me to this origin originally and and made me stick you don't use screens i never liked the idea of metal i never i the less the best and so if i could uh take my medication just by smoking it or vaporizing it that's what i wanted to do and these are actually toys uh these are key chains and most people would throw them out or use them just for that no they are the perfect cannabis pipe and it's as easy as just taking it apart you unscrew the uh nose piece and then you take out this little plastic piece and then you're done and now you have your pipe and what i found is that um the tubes that come on dry cleaners and so i took that tube and i put it together with the marichum and then i used shrink wrap why are you adding the tube to the mirsham uh to cool down the smoke what you find is depending on how long uh most people would find this very long i find this just adequate of length that it will cool down my smoke perfectly i hear this is yours i love i love by the way you rolled one for each of us too of course i happen to believe that everyone should have their own you and me both my friend uh this is a tapioca tube uh i bend over one end tape it and then what's remarkable about this is that you can take this traveling or anything like that and it protects the joint but where it's really wonderful is when you've finished and you have that roach that's really smelly in that you just pop it back in here tape it up and you're done and you don't stink up the room or anything and what's fun is since it's color cord coordinated you know what's in it you like to you like to use matches right yeah i've always been a match person i learned uh when i was uh in the 80s that wood matches everything leaves you taste it everything you'll taste if you're lighting something up except with paper matches if i light this and let it burn to where the the waxed area is burned it's as clean as it's going to be i'm not going to get anything else cleaner um i like it yeah it's good enough reason for me oh very good all right thank you sir i'll be over to you i just want to let it get and then after you get going this is my little fun novelty item and what it is it's a stainless steel funnel but what's really nice is when you're smoking and you're done you don't you just drop it and that way you don't smudge the end crease it or if you use water that's worse because then the joint never lights up again sure so you keep something like this just in the ashtray here maybe and then uh and as you see that's a pretty tall joint and there's no problem what kind of papers did you use these are called raw they're the newest paper put out by uh it's called classic raw and they are cannabis they are made from hemp why do you use these because they are the thinnest paper you can buy the thinnest paper made and they just came out as you know raw is huge it's been around for sure ever but just within the last year they came out with this new product nice uh yeah you know i i'm a big fan of the papers i use too everybody knows i use the club rolling papers yes but for that very same reason is the thinness of the paper i know that the clubs are 10 grams per square meter of paper 10 grams which is one square meter fun fact huh yeah and it's and ultimately because if you're going to roll a joint you know it's about smoking the cannabis and not smoking the paper or smoking any additives that were in the paper perhaps and so you want as little paper as possible i typically cut down my papers less is best i'd rather not have any but uh is wonderful neil's okay so so we have uh some varieties here to try so let's let's assess this first okay very good this is the tie but it's three years old what's your how have you had this stored for three years vacuum packed in a refrigerator uh in a mason jar you're keeping it dark you're keeping it you know away from any excess oxygen and you're keeping it cool to help you know preservatives and i cheat and i use a um bovi bag the little bovita uh humidity yes yep sure what i want to say though about the tie before we move on is the immediate thing i initially noticed was how smooth it was and you telling me that it's been curing for three years you know i'm sure speaks you know volumes towards that i'm also noticing a spiciness to it a woody kind of spicy that's the cure yes very good but but if i may get into the consciousness it's not a couch no yeah and thankfully so yeah no this is the i think one of the problems with sativa is a lot of people are looking for something that's not there sativa to me has nuances it's it's very up it's very um forward sure uh it's not couch potato it's not something no and i think that's that's that's the reputation sativa has you know people who are looking for more of a cerebral or a more energizing or creatively inspiring experience i think tend to lead to lean towards the satisfaction so few people get an opportunity to smoke a real sativa that isn't a hybrid and that's i think the bigger point here is is most of the sativas in the marketplace today are being deemed sativas are at best you know maybe maybe 40 sativa at best well and very good but i say it a little differently if it's not 100 it's not sativa in other words as soon as you introduce the indica um it's no longer sativa and and what i looked for and even now more so is to keep it sativa and what i would rather do is to mix buds than to mix genetics i would much rather grow out everything as land race do it on the back end right right because you can always do it you have more control you have total control you haven't contaminated you know for you know for better word the genetics will said and in fact that's what everybody's scrambling for now they're all looking for the land race the old land race it's kind of sad you know um also i like land race because i think it has a clarity you just can't get from an indica uh i'm feeling a lot of energy from this time it's gonna start growing on you it was a nice elevator is that why you only took a hit or two it is while you watched me go why one after the next how do you also okay what do you got next for us here uh the next one will be the hawaiian always look for the end where you have the little tab this is convenient uh you know niels one of the things that i love about you man um is your attention to the detail you really pay crawl into all the little nuances um yeah you know again just you know you come up with your your little holder you decide okay i'm going to color coordinate them you decide i'm going to get color coordinated tape but beyond that you put the tape on and you even make the little tab for the easy pull off and put back on right it's all fun i have uh two daughters uh one of them does not care for cannabis at all uh the other one uh benefits from it hugely and uh i'm lucky enough to be able to interact with her as an adult she just turned 30 on this level so that also drives me is i'm another one of my hobbies is cooking and what i'm trying to create is the cookbook of the ancestors so what that is is i'm gonna find the best recipes i can create this cookbook and then give it to my two daughters and then in turn they'll add to it oh wonderful or not and then in turn the next generation the next generation just for fun with cannabis i'm hoping to hand off all my genetics to my daughter um and let her uh enjoy the world that i have been blessed with um but also there's so many individuals now that are my age that are really in need of cannabis um that's really that is a truly uh uh remarkable gift that you're going to leave for your kids and a legacy um you know because again it's pretty unique maintaining these genetics in the pure form as you had i think even a lot of the source countries from what i've heard even their genetics to a large degree have been hybridized out okay some clowns back in the 80s late 80s early 90s went down to columbia went down to thailand went to mexico with indica genetics and started introducing them into these places yeah there are still pockets isolated pockets of pure genetics fortunately i hope so but yeah to have something like this here in california well it's available to any and all who are uh wanting and that's what i'm about it brings me tremendous joy to be able he's not serious don't you try and contact neil's okay he's not giving out these genetics this is between him and me all right uh i i'm going to use my lighter for this one okay this way we can we can spark simultaneously well that's a pretty fancy lighter cheers cheers tell us about it you want to know about my lighter so um i'm all about the tools as you know by now uh about me neils um because i like anything that's going to help individualize the experience for me and anything that's just going to help maximize my enjoyment so i like fun little gadgets and tools whether it be you know antique you know sterling silver ashtrays or something a little more contemporary like this lighter i had made by this artist wasteland odysseys made this lighter it's the name of the artist and it has been it's a tooled leather is what it is it's hand tooled and then it's been hand painted afterwards yeah i was so impressed with his work i've had a couple custom lighters made for a few of the guests i've had here on high rollers i had one made for a swami and i had one made for the dank duchess as well i saw swamis yeah that was really neat so this hawaiian this um has an interesting flavor to it much different than the thai uh yes it does um now i'll warn you it's um a little in my opinion uh you're warning me now well yeah because it'll go out but yours hasn't gone out so i'm glad it hasn't uh i will tell you that it's a creeper and that you will think that um you are at a certain level but it will creep on you what fun [Music] but i wanted to get back real quick to ty if i may what was interesting about ty is it had a freak in its genetics the seeds wouldn't always open what would happen is the seed would crack but then the cotyledons would not be able to work their way out and the seed would die so that's where we use this device which is this little what little gadget do you have here and now this is actually really important it's just a little a clamp uh miniature that a jeweler would use or somebody in miniature hobbies and that but what makes it very important is that it gives you the ability to crack the seed without going too far so in other words it allows you to apply just the right amount of force to the seed to split it without then damaging the cotyledons while we're on the subject of germination i think we should i think now's the time to tell our little story so we were filming the cannabis cultivation certificate for a green flower and we had mel frank and myself here in studio doing a course on uh seed germination and he had seeds that he had brought in these 22 year old skunk number one seeds right and he had him in various stages of germination he brought him in for this demonstration that we did we finished the shooting for the day and he says well i don't need these you know it's it's it was it was late fall when we did the class so it wasn't time to start you know for the next spring and he says hey i'm just gonna toss these out and i didn't have the heart mel frank's 22 year old skunk number one seeds so what do i do is i walk them out to uh out of the front of the office here a green flower and i find a little spot and i uh you know just move the dirt away and it was nice and moist near one of the sprinklers and i just put them in i threw the dirt on them just to give them a shot you know i just didn't i i i just could not throw them in the trash can okay this is life this is a beautiful life sure enough two weeks later these sprouts come up and there's a little patch of nine little uh little sproutlings little cannabis sproutlings however they they weren't going to live long here uh a green flower either somebody was going to get angry or one of the gardeners that comes and just services the facility was going to knock them down so i reached out to you niels and i said hey got these mel frank's you know skunk number ones man they're they're sprouted out front you got to come save them they're looking for a home and nils you came and adopted them and i came with my spoon so yes i did come down i felt kind of strange though going to the front door and helping yourself but i took five and left the three yeah and here we go here we are it's like a couple three months later this is one of the five right this is one of the five and this is uh a female that's flowering and actually it's already been pollinated uh but that's the phase that it's in right now is i'm going for seed because what you do is you self-pollinate them right you you now had a male or two in the group right i was lucky enough that uh when you planted the seeds there was one male all the rest were females and uh i actually as you know i do pollinate myself but this one i just left everything together in the grow chamber and let it pollinate all the plants you know 50 years after your journey began you know you've been you've been keeping these genetics alive these these land race you know cultivars and now all these years later you've got a new one to add to the collection that was also a relatively old school variety very much so and just the history not only uh with all due respect that it came from you but uh also that it was uh blessed by mill who i'm a huge fan of doesn't get any better than that man does it no skunk number ones well hey niels thank you so much for coming in today sharing your tools your techniques your genetics your stories with us it's been a good time man very well it's been fun and uh i also very much value our friendship know that the feeling is mutual meals i've enjoyed our friendship uh i've enjoyed uh hearing all your old stories sharing your wonderful genetics that you've been preserving and yeah it's been a fun journey man i look forward to continuing it with you i look forward to our further trips together also far out and i look forward to everyone joining us on the next episode of high rollers where we're going to crawl into the tools the techniques and we're going to have a good time so see you next time", "zVQruAIpxWk": "[Music] welcome to wheat entertainment and we love talking about grandy flora strains and this bud is something called yada da and it's really a unique looking bud but it was crunchy dry when i got it i opened up this bag and then i set it down and now it's even drier because i think i got this thing i don't know three weeks ago a month ago it just sat in the back i don't know why i didn't review it but i didn't do it so today's the day for yada da and let me load my little scooper into vapor cup straw i've already got two in here we're gonna add the third then we're gonna tamper and we're going to stick this down in the vapor cup then we're going to talk about yadda da yada comes in this bag and i got this at cookies maywood i got this at the apples and bananas drop down there i ran down there they held that for me and there were some comments on wheat entertainment so i grabbed it when i was down there and this flower has 26 thc and people are asking for the package date and uh so i'm going to give it that but to get that date i need a magnifying glass because my eyes aren't so good anymore so this is the package manufactured it is 9 29 20. oh no wonder it's so dry it's been in this bag for months right and you know what's crazy you would think that they're saving money on the jars right so at least they would give us some kind of moisture pack in here so these flowers when they come out of this bag are more fresh so let's say i got this the beginning january was harvested three months before crazy just crazy but anyway it's not about the dryness i don't wait for that so even though i note it that has nothing to do with my ratings my ratings are all about the something something and everyone's got their own something something that they're looking for but what i'm looking for are heavy flowers with focus that could grin me out i have to stay active i have a lot of responsibilities have to take care of i need flowers that can let me do that now i'm also a heavy hitter so a lot of the flowers even though i call them focus flowers they could stone you to the bone but it doesn't necessarily do that for me but certain ones do like the couch lock flowers but this isn't about catch lock i'm not looking for those type of flies this is about focused flowers that can grin me out so today it's jan dada turn to get the review we're looking for the best well let's check it out so you can see that's about amount a time it takes for vapor cup to work you can see that right there that's the terpenes the cannabinoids the water vapor and the oil vapor you can see it condenses right on the straw it takes about a minute and 20 once this cup is hot and also a lot of people have vapor cup so make sure your cup is hot if the cup is hot you need less time in the chamber if it's a fresh you just start it up you're going to need more time in the chamber and that's one of the things when you get vapor cup you got to learn use but i love this thing this thing changed my life but today it's about yada da so let's check it out yada da by grandiflora at 330 degrees out of vapor cup let's do this again so this flower's got a light og taste with a pungent pal but there's much bigger pungent pals than this one but it has it and the pungent pal it's i'm gonna say it's something like the chicken wing you know when you go buy chicken wings you smell it it makes you kind of like the ammonia taste people say ammonia but if you try vapor cup i'm going to tell you it's a pungent pal this flower took me a lot of flour to get stoned actually but it definitely got me stoned this flower's strong enough but not super strong and i thought it was good so what did i rate yada da i'm looking for the best and this flower you know at first i'm saying it's not strong enough but i used a really lot of it i used up half an eighth on the session i mean i really used a lot of it and in the end the feeling was actually kind of good it wasn't heavy it wasn't you had focus or didn't have focus i would say it was like a cruiser a little bit i wish it personally would have been a little heavier this flower gets an 8.65 which means it's a good flower if you're not a super heavyweight yeah it's a try but for someone who's a super heavyweight this flower may be not strong enough for them it was good but there's definitely better out of granny flora if you want to get a vapor cup this item right here and i'm telling you instead of smoking your flour up and joints get one of these things that little bit of flour that i put into this cup can last you 10 minutes and stone you to the bone i love this thing makes so many opportunities for use i love it and you can see it at vaporcup.com if you want to see my favorite picks you can see them on wheat entertainment.com that site's just getting updated right now it's going to have my top 100 strains in la out of 1500 strains i tried this is my journey i'm looking for the best thanks for joining in if you have a tip for me leave it below the video i'm the doctor i post every day but sunday it's my day off party on my friends [Music] you", "Wx8ncksrkC8": "[Music] oh what's going on everybody my name is greg aka flippadelphia philadelphia flip flip play in philadelphia but a lot of people just call me flip and on this channel we smoke weed talk about weed products and just kind of chill if that sounds like something you'd be into hit that subscribe button it's like right here whisper style and today's nickname was brought to you by peyton moore thanks for the nickname homie and always sunny in philadelphia is one of my favorite [ __ ] shows so big shout outs to that if you've got an idea for what my next nickname should be leave it in the comments and maybe i'll consider that [ __ ] at some point if i feel like it and in today's video we're going to talk about something that can turn any bong you have into a dab rig an electronic dab rig it's the dab x mach 1 titanium rocket i did the lights in the back red and white because i feel like that's like standard rocket colors for some reason i don't [ __ ] know and if you stick around to the end of the video so yeah you can save some money on it but before we get into anything i figured we could use this [ __ ] to take a dab obviously because that's what the [ __ ] does i got some island sweet skunk right yeah that's what the [ __ ] it's called island sweet skunk by the homies over at cresco they make some [ __ ] flame ass [ __ ] straight up so let's get right into it [Music] please [Music] [Music] okay so the dab x that [ __ ] was [ __ ] dope uh and it comes with a bunch of little accessories and stuff right so first of all in here you got like a little extra chamber you got like a little traveling cap it's not a carb cat people i thought it was at first too but it's not so you're not using it you can put that on the top so no dirt and debris can get in there and [ __ ] all right so that's [ __ ] cool it comes with this little stand in there so like you never really have to put it on its side you can always just kind of like i mean you can't put that you could have put it on there with the battery because it's too heavy but you can always have this part like one a little stand in there and just have the battery next to it and it's all magnetic so you just like kind of click it together and it's ready to go right you just throw that onto your piece and bing bang boom you can take a dab the little cap says dab x this is gonna be so hard to see this look at that there it's so cute can you see it bad look at that it's dope and it's not a car cat i swear they literally hit me up like in the messages and they were like hey just so you know that's not a carb cap it's for like storage i was like oh all right cool you just take it out look put it in this little stand next to the thing it's got usbc charging and [ __ ] very cool right you're just gonna put them next to each other on the shelf it's [ __ ] heat it's fire super easy to use five clicks on five clicks off i feel like i said five because it's fly and five maybe i don't know i'm high [ __ ] right now other [ __ ] that it comes with it comes with the little dab tool you saw me use uh for the hit right it comes with an extra chamber for on top for when your like little bowl gets a little dirty and [ __ ] so you can just replace that just screws on super simple and it comes with this like little case in which this will be and in here is also like a charging cable and some extra o-rings and [ __ ] like that you know just general upkeep type [ __ ] right but most importantly i like the little box that comes in it's [ __ ] dope and the outside is that titanium kind of color i might just i'm keep this box i'm like a stickler for boxes like companies have cool boxes there's usually cool [ __ ] inside them right but let's go over some specifics right it has four temperature settings uh which you can cycle through using three clicks uh so you turn it on five clicks let me just show you actually it'll be way easier just pop it off so five clicks on and off it's gonna do a little light show when it turns on and then one two three wait man i did maybe i turned it off [ __ ] because it was already on all right two three four five turns on right i got it at the blue setting that's their like preferred setting it's the lowest one honestly but isn't that like 380 to 400 degree range nice cool dab you get all that full flavor i really like that [ __ ] right click it three times maybe i clicked it five times by accident or maybe it's on the white setting the white settings that stoner setting 400 to 420 degrees hey 420 baby and they say that's the best for like pressed stuff you know what i mean if you got some dabs that's been pressed you want to use that setting on there and then you can click it again three times boom boom boom we got the green setting the flipping loud setting hey we gotta take a hit on the green setting at some point even though i think they said this is more for like crystalline products you know what i mean uh you got diamonds and [ __ ] like that you want to use that on this setting right and then of course you got that crazy setting the red setting the danger [ __ ] setting the i'm gonna hit you in the [ __ ] lungs setting right and they say that's really best for like if you got like a bigger [ __ ] setup like if you about to take like a three foot bong out of hit like hit out of this [ __ ] we have a three and a half foot bong his name is mammoth like mammoth because he's big as [ __ ] he's actually in the corner over there i have not broke him out on the channel yet maybe i'll have to one of these days he needs some like a little bit of upkeep though and a new stem uh he's he's older he's an old man now but he's cool as [ __ ] so maybe we'll break him out one of these days and [ __ ] maybe we can throw the dab x on there let's take another dab real quick though just oh wait i forgot to tell you all the temperature settings i don't even [ __ ] remember where i get to white right all right so the greens like 420 to 440 and the red is like 440 to 470 i think they said the reds just like crazy [ __ ] we might have to take a red setting or at least a green one because channel colors and [ __ ] gotta rep the channel of course all right so where was i all right so we we got through circling through our [ __ ] right uh when you're ready you're gonna hit the launch sequence i like that they called it a launch sequence because it's the rocket it makes sense [ __ ] liftoff you know what i mean cool [ __ ] like that so uh let's let's do this [ __ ] let's take another little dab real quick right let's do it on the uh should we do it on the [ __ ] crazy red setting i mean this this is a small this is a small bong i'm using right here so i feel like it might be a little too much there's some water on the top of it that's weird let's do the green setting right let's get through here let's get to green there's white we're gonna go crazy the green all right and then you get the the temperature and like i said that just kind of clicks on there you're gonna grab this little tool man i [ __ ] love dabs get you super big let's just do a little one a little bit bigger though a little bit bigger a little more running out running out of my [ __ ] i'm gonna have to go to the dispensary soon all right time to take a dab all right so just hit the launch sequence it's a two clicker bing bing all right it says heating up in whatever color you chose i know that might be hard to see you see it's already heating up right and then you just inhale slow and then this little buttons for when you want to clear the chamber right it actually vibrates when it's ready i don't know if you heard that because my letter was moving damn green green sentence [ __ ] crazy damn okay that [ __ ] hit me that was strong as [ __ ] right green heated up like what's up clean out one of these bad boys i'm good to go whoo this [ __ ] is [ __ ] flames all right so there is some [ __ ] i forgot to tell you about right so if you've already been taking dabs and like it's already like it's going around and you're just throwing more in it you can skip the preheat like setting by doing like like a long hold and then a short hold for like it like skips all the preheat [ __ ] and if you're just keeping it going you want to keep hitting it and [ __ ] and it's already heated up you can enter manual mode where you literally just like hold this button down as long as you want to hit it for right so you hitting it you just like you just hold it like you know what i mean manual mode just has it this should have light up so it knew like that we're gonna turn it off for a second because i'm highest but all right whoo shit's nice man i'm super happy they hit me up with this because this [ __ ] is dope there's a little bit in there that button right there that's like the clear the chamber button right you hit that hits that extra airflow so like you kind of like you don't hit that button this one right here and then like you kind of let it get all like [ __ ] milky in there and then boom hit it with the clear [ __ ] like watch right listen to this i just drank some water i put a little extra water in here between the hits because there was like this much water left in the water bottle so i was like ah this could take it and it was like a lot more than i had originally planned so i just drank a little bit of water because this is filled up a little high at this point honestly dabs where have you been on my i wish i was younger when dabs like came out and [ __ ] you know what i mean and if you ever want to know where your battery's at you can always check it by clicking this button four times one two three four and it'll tell you where your battery's at white means you're fully charged [Music] hey [Music] [Music] [Music] apparently the battery is bigger ship you can get anywhere between 30 to 50 dabs off one full battery depending on what [ __ ] temperature setting you're using it at yeah so that's [ __ ] dope i mean this [ __ ] lasts forever once again i love the cool little case that it comes in because it's cool opens like a book there's a nice little message written from the guy you know what i mean it's like hey man that's buying this rocket mock one if this is just the mach 1 rocket like i hope i hope i can't wait to see what like more [ __ ] they do you know what i mean because this is already dope and shout out to their website dabex.com right right here and i'm gonna tell you why i'm shouting out the website specifically because there's something super [ __ ] satisfying when you scroll down their website because as you scroll down like it has this whole thing like being put together as you scroll and it's cool as [ __ ] i'm gonna put it up on the screen i probably did that already while i was talking about it and this is now a relevant statement that's how we run things around here irrelevantly it's just something super satisfying about that for me like the website was cool as [ __ ] so like i'm gonna make sure y'all see that cool ass website also the little x's that kind of turn or do their little [ __ ] dance when you're when you're reading through the [ __ ] i just hit myself in the hat i'm [ __ ] baked right now yo all right so before i recorded this video i ate uh a nerds rope they're like 400 milligrams of pop so i was already like like feeling that [ __ ] before we started and like i'm in full effect from that and the dab at this point like whoo i still got some of those nerd ropes left too let me see if i can find one to show you guys i think i have like two more be right back all right so yeah [ __ ] medicated [ __ ] nerds ropes 400 milligrams 60 minute excavation time it's been about an hour 20. i'm wrecked all right but before we go i gotta tell you make sure you hit up their website with all that cool [ __ ] i just talked about and make sure you use my coupon but you gotta be quick about this because the first 20 people are the only people that are going to get this right so i've used my code loud 20 you can get 20 off but you have to be one of the first people to use the coder it's not going to work straight up but the code is loud 20 first 20 people get 20 off i think they run for like 250 bucks so you gotta act fast because people are probably gonna scoop these up pretty quick right i'm high [ __ ] i'm gonna get the [ __ ] out of here don't forget to like comment share subscribe all that [ __ ] normal youtubers tell you to do before we go should we take another dab probably not but we're gonna oh man i'm running super loud [Music] not on green again that [ __ ] was crazy back to blue cresco makes the best [ __ ] [ __ ] i swear to god [Music] [Music] of karate and friendship for everyone day man [ __ ] love that show man what have you taken permission from marijuana a few marijuana", "1PaBHXjylns": "hey everybody and welcome back so check it out for this video I will be trying this is the Platinum garlic live sauce by Willamette Valley alchemy alright so this is the platinum garlic this is a live sauce it's very salty and I'm gonna be trying out for the first time here oh really quick before we open it up we're gonna tell the test results here now on this product it does not actually say a percentage so like these ones by Willamette they say percentage right there and whatnot this one however doesn't okay there's no percentage except for the terpene percent the terpene percent is 8 point 23% terpenes on this product right here however it does say th see the total container is 630 point 6 milligrams so I'm assuming and somebody correct me if I'm wrong that's in the 60 percentile it's like 63 64 percent around there correct me if I'm wrong somebody in the comment section but I believe that's how it goes so this should be around in the 60 percentiles somewhere in there alright and this again is 8 point 23 percent on the terpenes I guess this is more of a product where they focus more on the terpenes the flavor the taste then they do like actual THC I guess maybe maybe not I don't know but I kind of get that where you know the terpenes seem to be the main focus so that that's what I gather from this product I could be totally wrong maybe that's not the way they intended it but that's what I gather so far from just you know being able to read everything you know the terpenes are right there and a percentage easy to read right there the front however all the other stuff is in the back and there's no percentage of it it's milligrams so leads me to believe that we're supposed to be focusing on the terpenes for this product ok which most sauces are like them alright now we open it up I got in there nice little logo right there we'll have a valley logo look at all sexy as [ __ ] and then I open it up and you get a wooden coin in wooden coins says welcome to the Willamette Valley alchemy family this is the shield shield is going to protect me from nasty dabs nasty dabs this keeps the nasty dabs away all right so if you got that open blast shitty butane soup you know what I mean dad's keep it away I got the shield it's gonna protect me right over here protect me at all times all right you got a nice little glass container here and make sure there's nothing else in there now the farm that made the product that they use to make this product is a rogue farmer okay that is the farm that they use to cultivate to make this okay well lament valley is just the processor and this live sauce this platinum garlic is an indica so in the couch so to speak is this should be a body hi nice relaxing body hi this should be like you know something it'd be like anybody going through like really hard pain anybody going through appetite situations where you know loss of appetite and stuff like that anybody going through you know problems with insomnia sleeping stuff like that in because the way you should go and whoa whoa whoa oh that smells delicious that really does holy [ __ ] okay so that is what we're [ __ ] with right there guys look at how beautiful look at how beautiful of a product that is that is a really nice product you have to admit you have to admit that is it even if you don't like sauce even if you don't like this kind of consistency in your dabs this is right here look sexy nice nice very very vibrant golden color to it and it smells delicious all right so let's try this I can't wait any longer let's try this if you've ever had this product before the Platinum garlic's garlic's if you've ever had the Platinum garlic then let me know in the comment section below on this video your thoughts and opinions on this product if you've ever tried Willamette Valley products then let me know your thoughts on that company in the comment section below or I'm always wanting to know other people's thoughts and opinions on some of these products that I try so let me know your thoughts in the comment section a big shout out to Empire Glass Works we're gonna use use this UV glass right right there up to nice little designs in there you guys probably seen it in my other videos but I like it I really like this piece it's one of my absolute favorites [Music] [Music] all right so I got a nice little hearty sized dab here of this live sauce and we're gonna wait for this nail to cool down because we definitely do not want to take it hot we want to make sure that we take this product at the right temperature okay cuz when you have a product that focuses on the terpenes like this one does you want to make sure that you take it at the right temperature so you can get the full experience the full flavor the whole package you know what I mean now really quick while we're letting this cool down let me tell you guys if you guys ever have glass cases like this these little glass containers and you guys got this kind of sauce or anything like that in them you'll notice that you know no matter what you do with your dab stick as much as you try to get it all you can't ever get it all okay there's always like a little bits that will stick over here to the sides and da-da-da-da-da and you just get in there with your dad stick but unfortunately you can't get every little last drop well I have a solution for your problem all you need to use is a straw that's right a plastic straw a drinking straw make sure it's clean and get it on in there get all the little bits all every little bit in there and then you just take your little dab stick and go poop and you got it on the end of your damn stick okay it's that easy just a little helpful technique if you guys are having issues with that I actually have a video on that so go check it out if you're interested we should be right we're located here we go much love guys thank you for watching the video you guys are all [ __ ] awesome [Music] [Music] all right I'm high as you guys could clearly see that did the trick okay that was really great the high is great all right I love it definitely Zach offer made me cough but taste it great okay you get a perfect blend of what I'm assuming is Platinum Girl Scout cookies I'm assuming that's what makes the Platinum side of this platinum garlic because you definitely get kind of a tinge of that you definitely get kind of like a little flavor you know just a little tinge of it and I really like it and you definitely get the garlic okay the garlic's there if you've ever had like garlic breath garlic cane GMO any of those kind of strains than you know what I'm talking about it's got that stinky gassy garlic taste to it you know that just pungent musters the nostrils taste to it it definitely is there it's definitely present and it's definitely I wouldn't say it's like super you know just mouth-watering gushers taste you know but it's definitely not mild either it's like somewhere in between it's it's perfect okay if you are a Terp [ __ ] okay if you were somebody that loves those terpenes that's all you're about you don't care about getting high then this is for you although you are gonna get high like high suck but seriously though this you're somebody that chases those terpenes chases that flavor this is for you check this product out now I paid $36 recreationally for this product okay now I'm sure depending on what dispensary you go to that price is going to fluctuate but that's where about around where it should be about thirty-six dollars for this one they do have other ones that range a little higher into like the 40s and stuff so just be aware this is the Platinum garlic mints not those other ones oh haha I'm a dumbass I'm a [ __ ] [ __ ] dumbass the percentage is on this container not that container so everybody just go ahead and start making fun of me in the comment section right now cuz that was a total stoner move right now just go ahead I'll wait oh wait just everybody make your comments this guy's [ __ ] [ __ ] this guy's dumb this guy [ __ ] it getting too high this guy's no idea was talking about anyway so 63 percent THC so I was right okay 63 percent THC I knew it I was right and then of course I already told you guys the terpenes and it absolutely has no CBD in it okay so those are the overall test results of this product and it is an indica so I mean overall I have to give this to two thumbs up two big thumbs up that been easily hands down Amy wasn't even a hard decision to make sometimes I've had hard decisions because I like to reserve my two thumbs up for products that are really good okay so that way if you guys ever decide to try any of these products that you see in my videos you'll somewhat agree with me I've had a lot of people agree with me that's you know but you know products to get to thumbs up highly highly recommended I haven't had a single person complain be like oh that [ __ ] you recommended was garbage you know like everything that I try to preserve the double thumbs up for really good and this definitely earned it okay hands down this is a product at that price point that kind of you know sauce live sauce that kind of flavor that kind of chirps that kind of high I'm pretty high yeah man that is definitely two thumbs up worthy right there so it has definitely earned it big shout out to Willamette Valley alchemy you can follow them on Facebook and Instagram they are a really good company okay consistency is key and they definitely keep a consistent product at good prices so check them out legal Oregon

"what's up homie murder bombs small tubes been a minute [Music] we here at the lab you know um yes that well like you can see it there's little circulator running that's recovering a run from the closed loop system but for right now we bounce in a little bit of dry [ __ ] just real quick nothing's nothing special just doing some quick bounce tech let me get that off here so it doesn't contaminate that just doing some quick balance tags you know it's been a long day i've run a little over four and a half pounds and i don't have any hash i mean i have somehow but i want different you know what i'm talking about so how is everybody how's your day going what day is it [Music] okay that's the this is uh 120 through 159 not the cleanest or anything just trying to just trying to get a little something together to rip with you guys oh we can't do it like that can't see [ __ ] um [Music] not bad huh for some midzies so you're looking to learn about some dry [ __ ] mojo jojo well then i i have wonderful news for you i uh i finished uh shooting and there's just a little bit of editing for the um second video in the patreon series and aside from that i had all this uh dressed up stuff out and i had some material that i was working with so i went ahead and shut up oh comprehensive driveshift uh tutorial-ish video really a sort of revisiting because i have uh i watched a couple of bubble man's um old videos and some john brothel and a d420k and i realized my dry sip tack is nowhere near what it should be and um well to give you an idea why i'm feeling okay about it i'll just show you here in a second we pressed some rosin we're gonna show you [Music] and what we're doing [Music] wanted to see what kind of a quality product i can get from this and still um this this will still maintain a pretty a really reasonable view um this is 120 through 1 49 159 dry sift but this is in a 50 micron bag um a little bit larger than i typically use for hash but not too let's see what we got right here again not not to clean just trying to bounce any particulate through the screen that's smaller than 74 micron obviously boom playing drum solos over here [Music] i tried to use the camera last time but i guess you can't focus when you're live on youtube oh [ __ ] can you guys see this not bad for how long you saw we just worked on it 519 canada here shout out to my dry sipped masters from the north marcus of course uh john six grams i don't know i guess i could weigh it should we wear it yeah we can wear it why not oops we do have a little scale right here anyway so shout out to whoever the hell this company is no more batteries [ __ ] it usb rechargeable scale and i charged i've charged it one time and i've been using it for almost a month all right so we're going to weigh this the easy way [Music] make it a little bit of dry ice sit and really i was just bringing you guys in to take a break with me but when i set up the stream i noticed i had all that sift on the screen and i thought you guys might like to watch that hey four grams 3.95 looked like more didn't it all right guys it's good yeah i am tired i'm ready to take a dab i'm not sure how much i'm gonna get done after that but i have put in a very full day all right um [Music] you guys wanna you gotta [ __ ] it i guess we could press this real quick i do have some wonderful things to show you that i pressed earlier today from some dry sift that i spent much more time with um so if this stuff comes out amazing i'm going to be a little bit disappointed because why did i spend all that time making that stuff nah it's just there's absolute technique that cannot be denied and then of course there's the advantage to you know fully mature trichomes very dry fully mature trichomes in a very cold environment with very low humidity i mean in that setting you don't even really have to be this very good at this thing with all your variables perfect like that you're gonna you're gonna get some decent hatch but for uh mojo that said in the comments there a little bit ago about getting some screens or recently got some screens for driving oh what's happening here guys i can feel just a little bit of loose sift that's around it you know i don't want that on the parchment obviously okay now where's the first one the one i'm on i don't know we'll see if we get any yold out of this this actually is some 160 160 to 249. huge very high micron hash i don't think we're gonna press that but hey let's see what happens with this step as a matter of fact i know i want to press this because [Music] we want to try to stream i guess by a little bit of dry slipping i meant a lot sorry sorry sorry let's go let's go let's go [Music] all right here we [Music] that's a go too close how's everybody doing how's everybody doing it was a little fluffy you know what that points to unfortunately a high uh count of a capitate and stocks so that's contentment um only only contaminant would have it looking so fluffy like that we both thought it was like [ __ ] when you said seven grams i was like yeah probably maybe even a little more and then it was half all right guys so we're gonna first press the uh which one is this i can't remember which one was the bigger bag now the bigger bag was the last one so this is the 120-159 this is the 74-119 i think yes this is the 70 419 that's the stuff that we thought was seven grams but it's actually get my big fat head out of your way [Music] [Music] should be ready to go whoa those are some big comments yo what up austin video is called miz uh mecca mccall man static oh yeah [Music] so i don't know who so so dare you you must not have been here for the beginning i was talking about the marcus um adding to your driveshift quiver that i watched about six years ago and then i revisited over this past weekend and it was a really it was a wonderful reminder um no we're not of course i didn't just do static tech i don't have the time for that right now just want to make some dabs [Music] no they're actually four thousand dollars so sorry to i'm sorry to so sir dirty i love your information i appreciate the help and everything but you're a little bit incorrect there brother um yes of course the video at least i well i mean bubble man pro had had published tutorials on full mel dry sift and static tech six years ago so that makes sense as far as the drying being done with a freeze dryer oh yeah sure it's a great way to do it but old school microplaning and and drying um on cardboard honestly if you know what you're doing if you know how to keep your room cool and dry it can be very dope aside from that even whether or not you're freeze drying or not you're going to have to microplane um unless you're just going to stuff chunks of well you know i have no way of doing static technique the same thing as you were thinking security i'd like to check that yeah oh of course we know that's v man yep it is you're absolutely right sir dirty it is very simple the uh well there's the [ __ ] [Music] oh he's always doing it dude that's that's all that's like every single day for solving this bacon big he goes live for like four hours at a time and washes and presses and you know all that that's what's up yeah so depending on if you want a pharmaceutical freeze dryer which for the record if you're going to get one through low temp um and we are we're only talking about harvest rate i am not going to speak on anybody or any other company's freeze dryer if you're going to go through low temp you're not you're only going to be able to get a pharmaceutical one and they're not and that's not 2 000. they do have a small freeze dryer that's like it has three shelves it's very very small if you don't need a pump or anything like that if i remember correctly i think it's uh we could just look it up i think it's like 25 maybe maybe 3 500 but if i remember correctly actually i think the medium one is because i was looking at the medium one with a pump and it was going to be right here just over four just over four grand i'm so interested in that uh [Music] i love it i love it um yeah i'm so interested in this static tech austin what you got what you got that's new yeah you and that's don't even get me started on that oil free clown so you know dope about fire fire driveshift if you accidentally [ __ ] around and get and get caught answering some questions on youtube and just watching your [ __ ] burn there's the 120 micron obviously buttered to hell because how long i let it sit on the press but i don't think it's gonna hurt it [Music] all right let's press the big one and then let's go take a dab and then i need to get the [ __ ] out of here but i like to say dear tate because it reminds me of joe dirk [Music] oh that's right yeah okay a moderator i understand i'm sorry i've been so into reddit lately you guys that it's just usually i mean bops are mostly moderators over there but anyway i get what you mean now you got a blue ranch when you go live with them and you help them keep [ __ ] together [Music] i know homie i'm waiting for my taxes to come back so i can make skunk man austin god damn it yo if you don't know anything about skunk man sam you actually don't even know anything about triceps and sir dairy that's you seem very knowledgeable and i don't mean to say that to be rude but i actually you're pretty knowledgeable so you probably know who scott manson is marcus himself bubble man himself shouted out to scott manson without skunk man sam we would be we'd be a long way behind in the full mount [Music] there we go there we go probably let that guy warm up for a little bit too long but that's okay that's the beautiful thing about pressing at 155 degrees you got a little bit of yeah a little bit of leeway looks like there's a couple of you in here hope you guys are having a good day i am wrapping up my work week we're trying to anyway i'm gonna have to come back tomorrow of course but here we go let's get a little bit of frozen banana dry sip hash rosin glow for you again remember guys i didn't really clean it we certainly didn't break out any static tech we're just trying to get some dabs for me to get going with skunk man sam is the [ __ ] man just i gotta say it again austin you know what's up hey thanks mojo i laven if you're old school weed too you remember brett mavericks using the static tech on a pool table with the playing card brett maverick used mavic was that that's that's long enough static tech ago that that's before uh i was seeing people regularly doing it with books and dvds and things damn see i knew we had some crossover man i love solving this bacon bank he's such a cool dude and you ain't kidding i do need a netflix series and i'm down for that pay too um but he is such a cool dude and i just like what he's about um i of course i'm i'm kind of busy doing the same same similar stuff so because of that you know oh i have the timer set for 90 seconds i'm gonna press a little longer than that it just we're probably about 110 right now um [Music] also i don't want to get too crazy with the pressure because i just want this to be fire i don't really care about you um that's a shitty thing to say yeah but solving this bacon baby's such a he's such a cool dude and he's just he just seems to be so like the thing i some people are like so you could say that but they're just so nice i don't get that with him i get to know [ __ ] from him i like that you don't need to be [ __ ] nice for me to be a fan of yours you need to be about your game and he is he's about his game i just don't know personally i get silly with trying to be nice to everybody again some presses you just don't [ __ ] care about the yield this was on the plant how long ago did we start streaming 21 minutes ago this was bud a little over 30 minutes ago now let's see here's our first press this is our one yeah this is the big microphone i think that stuff's going to be better 35 40 minutes ago for sure this stuff was flour in a plastic bin in a tupperware you know what's that you know what time it is only i had a [ __ ] rig ready over here [Music] better not take forever geez my desk is messy i'm so sorry you guys let's uh just bring you in on about that much of it so you don't have to look right at all oh i know what i want to show you so that's the this is a little bit of frozen banana dressing pass rosin that we just pressed together we made it [ __ ] around with the card didn't that card moved it around a little bit let some of the let's let gravity do most of the work for us and uh there we got those two processors from it i couldn't absolutely get a second press and i will later earlier today what did i press oh this is nightwing so here's some night queen dry swift rosin that i pressed a couple hours ago and this is the second press i never [ __ ] with second presses unless it's good hash good hash will press two sometimes even three times if you're not if you're if you're doing short presses or whatever if you're [ __ ] it out you shouldn't have to press it three times but anyway i just want to share that a little bit a little bit a little with you we got some super fire rosins for dab on and um we made them all from the plant to the parchment ready for the bag and it's just 45 minutes tops where are you where are you oh you guys wanna get silly little slurper dab i just saw the case over here don't do that that's how you lose a marble all right guys i gotta have that gauge up all right how we doing how we doing how we doing just so you know i can't see you and i have no idea what the hell is going on but i love you guys [Music] [Music] all righty then [Music] let's uh let's start this [ __ ] off right i'm going to start it off with that second press from the uh from the night queen oh [ __ ] i forgot that i'm working one thing [Music] and by working i mean taking a break i like to take a break about every six to eight hours yes i do work 12 hour days 10 to 12 hour days today is going to be a pretty short day though i'll be out of here i'll be out here right around 10 hours um anyway yes we'll slow down the recovery there a little bit so i can play with you guys for just a minute come on guys i think i just want to look at the picture of that deer pooping now so again give me something let me know what's up give me something to read in there sir dirty had all sorts of good information i do i hate that i'm so uh contrarian and so oppositional and i'm sorry about that but it seems like sometimes like somebody i mean regardless of whether or not he's right about the price we can agree to disagree or just look it up or whatever but i don't know why i have to oh no you're not right he [ __ ] cares if any of us are going to buy a freeze driver we'll find out by the time we check out you know what i'm saying you know what i'm saying there we go that blazer though all right so we're going to start this off with a excruciating dab of the night queen second press tricep hashgraph oh i barely even smoked last night i certainly haven't smoked anything yet today i've been working for since 10 when it's about 7 30. [ __ ] i'm at nine and a half hours now it looks like it's gonna be more like an eleven-hour day whatever where's that second graph that's not it that's not it that's a good problem to have right you like that you guys this is the other reason why i want to do a dab with a second press to start and you might be able to pick up you guys having fun watching me let me watch when i finally get my youtube page pulled up here on my laptop i'll be sitting here by myself i mean i don't know how anybody wants this [ __ ] i gotta be [ __ ] annoying as all hell but i love you guys and i love sharing my little bits of knowledge about how to make hashish with you well and don't worry guys if i knock this rig over digger gave this one to me um for court sales i want to say three years ago so it's a decent ring but it didn't cost anything surprise says oh that's me right there i was like i call myself a surprise set all right here we go oh that's that's actually a very big dab already cheers ladies and gentlemen oh my god i'm not even gonna be able to dab the president that's some night queen and really it's like trim then keith that i threw over a screen real quick and it was so terpy i almost couldn't even i really whoa that must be good where there's the very turkey dab one of you what whatever mcafee any cheers come on dude my antivirus pop up was cracking the comments and then thank you elite uh 27 m uh 27 32 and four and that's for the regular and that's in us dollars iso um but that's just a regular freeze driver it is a food grade freezer option but it's not the pharmaceutical ones which have way way way more um options and settings that you can play with as far as dry times dry times depth of vacuum temperature sublimation is a really amazing thing got me by the nose it really did too man it's like uh and honestly that's the oh that's the second press um mixed micron or whatever it didn't it doesn't have a very clean melt to be perfectly honest with you i'm a little less than impressed with that there's absolutely no char or particulate or anything it's just a little darker than i think it should know anyway let me set this down over here or not shut this down oh man yo night queen [ __ ] give me a break jesus i have never experienced that strain being that loud before um i i've washed it and pressed it i have some sugar of it it's just amazing but never had that happen jesus this frozen banana [ __ ] looks amazing this is not frozen now that's good man all right there we go now this should be the bee's knees wait that's the night queen again i can't do that it's definitely gonna be good that's the 120. the 120 to 159 oh all right here we go no he said it was 2k for a freeze driver and it's 2700 and if you're in canada that's more like three um so he was off by 50 number one and then number two that's if you if you have a pump if you need a pump too it's more unless i'm mistaken if that's the price with the oil pump the other thing is that anybody trying to get one of these to use it in a setting like i'm trying to use it in is not looking for an oil-free pump the oil free pump is like an extra six to eight hundred bucks so at that point it's 35 for the small one and for the record that freeze dryer is so [ __ ] small you're gonna be pissed at yourself for spending three thousand dollars on something that small when you could have spent four thousand on something that is significantly better but still goes back to my point i just i don't know why i always got to be right anyway that's fair and honestly that's the thing is if it's a thing to waste and you're like a hobbyist or whatever damn you're really going in on your hobby but for me i look at it as like well why would i spend two to three grand on something that then when i recoup the value for it it's too small so i mean um freeze dryer is on the schedule not sure what size i'll be getting but we'll see you know what's up it really does man what kind of class is on a dab right what would i say and then aside from that hello annie yeehaw right man damn i [ __ ] but i'm almost scared to go in on another job but we got but number one i need to wrap it up and number two come on jesus man i got dab sweats and [ __ ] my gloves all hashy man jesus and my hands are clammy now because they were in the glove that's probably why i was so hot it couldn't have anything to do with that dab i just took i'm sure it had to do with the gloves all right ladies and gentlemen you know how much i love you um i mean if you don't know who's being silly if sir dirty's still here let's haven't seen a comic i'm gonna walk but if you're stupid still here looks like we're going to split the difference um we're both no i mean to be fair i don't know i don't know actually i don't know about that before i think i just said they're not too um but also i was speaking about the pharmaceutical freezer regardless it is the morton salt girl except it's the morton salt girl taken and done by slinger which marble slinger is a glassblower but then he takes it and he puts an assault rifle in her hands and we have a salt girl that makes sense and this is a special february edition this one's called oh this one's called rain and blood that's right that was the other thing the slayer rain and blood um yeah i love slinger [ __ ] um but this is a this is the picasso version of the design super cool first time i saw it i was like that's like a morton salt girl and then i realized he's holding a gun and i'm like a salt assault like a salt oh god and i've been in love with it ever since because i'm an old nerd and when i see some [ __ ] like that and i think it's cool i never get over it jesus christ look at this [ __ ] frozen bananas you guys it's on was he i didn't know that was i didn't know that was with it but at the same time i was too you know hope you're still here if you're still here let me say something um that's what i was saying about the split the difference oh my god look at that melt you guys need to see the color this rosin is melting into uh [ __ ] dude i went in hot we went in just under 600 degrees holy [ __ ] you guys whoa hey what's up austin my homies in the northeast you know i love you i'm saying that a lot of them anyway that is a beautiful amount and if we were if you remember i was out of the right micron bag so i had to press that at 50. that's the 74 to 119 pressed in a 50 micron bag almost like the same size um you know not really but just a little bit so the fact that i knew that was going to be a little charry or maybe dark on the end as it did get a little char charlie when it dried up or finished but i cannot get over the color of that when it melted down was [ __ ] beautiful and it maintained its color for a minute tastes great tastes great it's a very interesting terpene profile um very very unique for me uh well you guys know it's got to be unique for me because every time i take a dab or a hit of anything i [ __ ] cough for 10 minutes and cry and that isn't happening so it must be different all right guys i was going to say have a great day but that dad was so [ __ ] delicious so delicious just like dog food tastes exactly like it smells delicious all right that's the low mic that's the that's the mids frozen bananas compared to this because this is way way way larger micron hash pressed out of a 50 micron bag so this is certain oh my god what do you guys think drop it i don't know sorry guys this [ __ ] is and i'd like to smoke something with some of my homies back home in missoula how is annie doing man thank you mom um reached out to me about um tincture help for either a sick person or a sick dog or i can't remember exactly but i wasn't able to find the uh micro encapsulation article i was looking for anyway uh it's been a while i'm glad you made it over so if anybody has the chance to try this strain frozen bananas this is my absolute first very very first experience with it [ __ ] uh don't get me wrong the guy that i the guy that i work with is an incredible brother absolutely incredible of the highest calorie so you know if you get your wheat from somebody that all the strains look the same don't be necessarily excited about frozen bananas it might not be that different this is very very exciting for me because it's so different than what i'm used to eddie peace 340. well that means it's 6 40 in california and almost 10 o'clock on the east coast cheers ladies and gentlemen that's exactly how you spell it with a k and one l oh my god wait you guys know i like that i like the flare for the dramatic but i tend not to exaggerate especially not when it comes to ash no cap definitely some of the best cash i have had hashtag that i've smoked so far this year period i don't care if it's from a hyperzone maker or if it's from the dispensary down the street this frozen banana ah find me um 120 to 159 the micron is dry ships hash rising is [ __ ] wild i cannot explain this taste to you guys i guess it is kind of mild like the way a banana is like a mild fruit but yo for real grizz that's what's up man austin where are you that's super cool yeah caspell's though also california's the only town county whatever it's the only place in montana that has a chick-fil-a so if you know what i'm talking about when i say there's nothing quite like the taste of [ __ ] hate oh you can only get it in council i got jokes open your heart let the hate out oh oh you guys i gotta lose some weight i gained weight during quarantine and then i just uh gained a little more love to michigan oh good luck with that because to be honest with you this is the problem the dab before this one i was supposed to quit and get and just finish what i need to do and be done but this [ __ ] is so good man so good nah anyway i hope you all have a wonderful week and hope you all have a wonderful weekend uh for those of you that are patrons or interested in becoming a patreon i'm sorry for those of you that are interested in patreon or are already patrons um i published uh one of the first of an eight video series um a couple days ago i've i have minutes maybe an hour left of editing for the uh part two part three is going to be wild it's going to be a celebration so far we're all only into hydrocarbon content but episode four if you can't tell from all these parchments around me is a dry sift and dry sift pressing episode so we got content coming go over and check it out if you like i and i say this because i encourage you those of you that are interested to just to go over and check it out it's you certainly you know pick the tier that you want with for whatever much you want to support me if you if you don't really give a [ __ ] about that and you just want to see what but what's up with the videos or if they're worth the money whatever then just do the small one you know either way you get to see with everything i just ask that anybody that has the ability and has any interest in helping to support me does that like mr david brazier has been like a [ __ ] high-level tear patron for a year and i mean i've while i think he's i think he's the longest that couple a couple of you guys have been rode with me and it's amazing but mr brazier from alaska i think he absolutely holds the record yes sir i'm gonna try i know this much up until um when i came to work today i had always had some hats you know what that or some oil or whatever but didn't really have any fire rotting feeling like my weekend's gonna be pretty sweet now let's get it started right cheers ladies and gentlemen after this i am gonna rock and roll and go ahead and finish my day pardon me i do encourage you to check out patreon if you're interested in processing a tutorial um hash tutorial but essentially processing tutorial content if you want to learn how to make some stuff make some high high quality stuff uh like there's there's a lot i number one i encourage you if you're gonna get into it to get a notebook my videos are you think my videos are long here the number two that's being published should be published tomorrow it's one right now i think i'm going to be able to knock down another couple minutes so if i should be able to get it to around one hour and 50 minutes it's just under two hours it's a [ __ ] movie i mean but it sucks and it's not entertaining however the amount of information in it is is probably pretty valuable um again check it out if you're interested if you're not i'm always here on youtube you can always email 710.consultations gmail.com you can always email the 7th extractions at gmail.com you're interested in booking a consultation and i'm actually i'm commenting from my 710 consultation so there it is 710.consultations gmail.com or you can text that number if you're interested in booking a conversation and for those of you that are interested in going over and checking out patreon that's great because i feel like i owe so much to the people that have supported me over the last year and the amount of content i i just fell short on being able to publish on time at all um i have this very very very comprehensive eight video series that i'm working on now and when it's finished it may be more like nine or ten videos but when it's finished i'm definitely going to turn off enrollment for a while um it's i uh it's hard when you finish a ton of content and then you need to get back to you know to work and or whatever you're doing and you have a new patreon patron or a subscriber or something come in and then you know their first question is when are you going to post something and i'm going like in my mind i'm thinking like i'm not even trying to shoot anything for a month so it's it's uh it's an interesting thing i'm not the kind of i'm not the kind of uh creator on patreon that like has a podcast going or anything that you would want you know that you check out regularly but there is a significant amount of information available to you right now and when i'm finished my a video series the amount of information that's available to you for the cheapest monthly subscription which is insanely cheap i think it's a pretty good deal i wish somebody would have put all that information together for me and been like give me a couple bucks and you can watch all these videos for a month all right guys yes you're absolutely right i didn't want so austin thank you um as far as things like if you might be interested in them like merchandise uh some personal time with me one-on-one stuff like if that's the kind of thing you're interested in there are some advantages to the opportunities but cheers ladies and gentlemen frozen bananas oh i'm under the same name i am everywhere brother however i do think it is all just one word i don't know why i spaced that either jesus that [ __ ] is so good i want to try a dab of it and save peace and kill the stream and that's my third day oh i love you guys but i gotta get back to it and get it wrapped up again i hope you have a wonderful weekend should anybody have any questions comments concerns anything feel free to go ahead and throw that in the comments section below and aside from that if you have any uh interest in a consultation inquiry you can email 710 dot consultations at gmail.com or you can text the number that i wrote in the chat 406-500-6698 peace", "QAkbtBShyp0": "hey everyone how's it going Eric here with peer pressure we're gonna be showing you our top five tips and tricks for getting the most out of your flower rosin so whether you're pressing at home on a hair straightener or using an industry-leading press like our peg speak rosin press we've got all the tips and tricks so you can get the most out of it tip number one quality in quality out this is the most important thing that you should know when you're making flower rosin or any rosin the better the material you're starting with the better your results are going to be and the fresher it is the better the clarity as material tends to age it's gonna oxidize and you're gonna find that that rosin is gonna come out darker so if you're looking to make the best flower rods and you possibly can get stellar material and press it as soon after its dried and cured as possible tip number two relative humidity makes a huge difference with flower rosin now you can go check out our other video where we did the full in-depth test but what you need to know is that your flower should be at least at 55 to 62% humidity before you press it this makes a massive difference in your yield so just make sure that your material is properly hydrated before you press it tip number three choose your temperature based on your desired results so we encourage a lot of experimentation and you're gonna find that most people are either pressing on the lower temperature range which is about 160 to 190 degrees Fahrenheit or the higher temperature range which is anything from 190 to as high as 250 degrees so depending on what kind of consistency you want to achieve that's where you're gonna set your temperature on the lower range you're gonna be looking at more of a butter on the higher range more of an oil or a shatter so when you have some material that you're playing around with we encourage you to try both ends of the spectrum and see which one you like the most tip number 4 choose the right micron bag type now you can absolutely press flower outside of a bag and get great results but that's usually only a gram or two you're gonna want to press in a 90 or 115 micron bag or at the most 150 we recommend not going any lower than 90 because that's when you're gonna see a huge drop-off in yield so if you're pressing flour in a bag make sure to stick in that range and finally tip number five if you're looking to make the highest quality flour on possible you absolutely don't need to overdo it on the pressure now you can definitely over press your flour rosin by applying way too much force at your bag and in fact we've seen great results not only with yield but of course with quality pressing at the lower end of the pressure range anything from around 550 to 1600 psi at the bag so when you're applying way too much pressure in the many thousands what can often happen is that you're pushing out plant fats lipids you know the waxes as well as all of those undesirable plant materials into the rosin really over pressing it so if you're looking for the highest quality rosin we recommend trying the lower pressure range and seeing your results thanks for watching we hope that you found that was helpful for more tips and tricks make sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel and follow us on social media at Goa peer pressure thanks again for watching [Music]", "FIkJQcDLGg0": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] what's up [Music] just what is it that you want to do [Music] just what is it that you want to do hello hello my hi friends dizzy grower here with a quick garden update for ya this is the two by two and a half gorilla grow tent which i'm running the chilled x3 mini this is day 44 of flower and these flowers are honestly a little behind schedule this plant got pretty stressed these plants got pretty stressed out by the thrift problem and i'm honestly still finding a few here and there so i did order some predators for the thrips called ambolysis cucumbers and they haven't arrived yet but they will be distributed directly onto the leaves and hopefully wipe out the rest of the issue um yeah so everything else is going fine in here though we're still plugging along and i'm not giving up yet now we're going to peek in at the 2x4 i'm running the hlgr spec here and the max stomper this is one max stomper plant this one had the same problem but honestly was way more resilient to the thrips than the primal punch was it recovered way better as you can see it has a ton more foliage that it was able to regenerate after i had to strip out all the leaves what's this i really don't know you guys can you help me figure this out because i'm kind of stumped here all of a sudden right in the very center of the tent over this last week i noticed right at that really crispy leaf some browning and then kind of all around it here you can see some curled leaves and just stress on the center area of the plant now this is not all stemming off of the same branch and i don't see any problem anywhere else in the tent so i'm really kind of confused it starts right down here and worst at the bottom there but works its way up i thought maybe light burn but since the worst is down low it doesn't quite make sense i went ahead and rose the light up raised the light up the last about inch and a half two inches that i could in there and it's not up to 100 percent either so i'm not really sure what's going on but the buds are developing pretty well they actually look a little bit bigger and better than the buds in the primal tent and they're about a full week behind time wise so yeah this tent is doing pretty good uh frosty and it's starting to smell nice and they're really interesting scent um different than any other thing that we're growing right now so pretty cool let me know what you guys think about that strange weird browning area if you have any thoughts as to what that could be and lastly we'll move on to the primal punch one this one is a three by three gorilla grow tent and i'm running the grow mao hacked light with four four led uh pucks and the chilled red board in the center this light always kicks ass and the spheno always kicks ass she was a little bit thirsty this day but you can see that she's getting really heavy everything is starting to lean on this grog screen pretty good and we still have about 10 to 14 days to go on the grow cycle here buds are looking really really frosty smelling nice they're doing their typical uh box tailing thing that they seem to do always on the spheno and they look like little rosebuds i really like this vino it's cool uh you can just see how much nug me is right there there's just like nug nuggets that's what happens when you scrog out well um everything that would have been a side you know on the branch is now kind of at the same level and everything all those buds are getting bigger than they would have if you just let it grow straight up you can see i'm starting to get some discoloration on the leaves a little bit of fade i had a little bit of like burning marks on these ones too i don't know if you can see that in the fan right there there's like a little yellow spot i don't know what's going on with that either i don't know if my entire room is just having some sort of issue but it doesn't look the same as the other tent i don't know anyway this one will finish out pretty soon and i'm looking forward to the harvest on it as always she is a resin production queen we get a lot a lot of resin which equates to a lot a lot of rosin all right well that's it for this one you guys i hope you have a great week we'll see you next time bye [Music] you", "0ygtX2nyexo": "I would like to tell you\nabout the most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to me in my years\nof working as a palliative care physician. This happened a couple of years ago. I was asked as a consultant\nto see a woman in her 70s -- retired English professor\nwho had pancreatic cancer. I was asked to see her because\nshe had pain, nausea, vomiting ... When I went to see her,\nwe talked about those symptoms and in the course of that consultation, she asked me whether I thought\nthat medical marijuana might help her. I thought back to everything that I had learned in medical school\nabout medical marijuana, which didn't take very long\nbecause I had learned absolutely nothing. And so I told her that as far as I knew, medical marijuana\nhad no benefits whatsoever. And she smiled and nodded and reached\ninto the handbag next to the bed, and pulled out a stack of about a dozen\nrandomized controlled trials showing that medical\nmarijuana has benefits for symptoms like nausea\nand pain and anxiety. She handed me those articles and said, \"Maybe you should read these\nbefore offering an opinion ... doctor.\" (Laughter) So I did. That night I read all of those articles\nand found a bunch more. When I came to see her the next morning, I had to admit that it looks like\nthere is some evidence that marijuana can offer medical benefits and I suggested that if she\nreally was interested, she should try it. You know what she said? This 73-year-old,\nretired English professor? She said, \"I did try it\nabout six months ago. It was amazing. I've been using it every day since. It's the best drug I've discovered. I don't know why it took me 73 years\nto discover this stuff. It's amazing.\" (Laughter) That was the moment at which I realized I needed to learn something\nabout medical marijuana because what I was prepared for\nin medical school bore no relationship to reality. So I started reading more articles,\nI started talking to researchers, I started talking to doctors, and most importantly,\nI started listening to patients. I ended up writing a book\nbased on those conversations, and that book really revolved\naround three surprises -- surprises to me, anyway. One I already alluded to -- that there really are some benefits\nto medical marijuana. Those benefits may not be\nas huge or as stunning as some of the most avid proponents\nof medical marijuana would have us believe, but they are real. Surprise number two: medical marijuana does have some risks. Those risks may not be\nas huge and as scary as some of the opponents of medical\nmarijuana would have us believe, but they are real risks, nonetheless. But it was the third surprise\nthat was most ... surprising. And that is that a lot\nof the patients I talked with who've turned to medical\nmarijuana for help, weren't turning to medical marijuana\nbecause of its benefits or the balance of risks and benefits, or because they thought\nit was a wonder drug, but because it gave them\ncontrol over their illness. It let them manage their health in a way that was productive and efficient and effective and comfortable for them. To show you what I mean,\nlet me tell you about another patient. Robin was in her early 40s when I met her. She looked though\nlike she was in her late 60s. She had suffered from rheumatoid arthritis\nfor the last 20 years, her hands were gnarled by arthritis, her spine was crooked, she had to rely\non a wheelchair to get around. She looked weak and frail, and I guess physically she probably was, but emotionally,\ncognitively, psychologically, she was among the toughest\npeople I've ever met. And when I sat down next to her in a medical marijuana dispensary\nin Northern California to ask her about why she turned\nto medical marijuana, what it did for her and how it helped her, she started out by telling me things that I had heard\nfrom many patients before. It helped with her anxiety; it helped with her pain; when her pain was better,\nshe slept better. And I'd heard all that before. But then she said something\nthat I'd never heard before, and that is that it gave her\ncontrol over her life and over her health. She could use it when she wanted, in the way that she wanted, at the dose and frequency\nthat worked for her. And if it didn't work for her,\nthen she could make changes. Everything was up to her. The most important thing she said was she didn't need\nanybody else's permission -- not a clinic appointment,\nnot a doctor's prescription, not a pharmacist's order. It was all up to her. She was in control. And if that seems like a little thing\nfor somebody with chronic illness, it's not -- not at all. When we face a chronic serious illness, whether it's rheumatoid arthritis\nor lupus or cancer or diabetes, or cirrhosis, we lose control. And note what I said: \"when,\" not \"if.\" All of us at some point in our lives\nwill face a chronic serious illness that causes us to lose control. We'll see our function decline,\nsome of us will see our cognition decline, we'll be no longer able\nto care for ourselves, to do the things that we want to do. Our bodies will betray us, and in that process, we'll lose control. And that's scary. Not just scary -- that's frightening, it's terrifying. When I talk to my patients,\nmy palliative care patients, many of whom are facing illnesses\nthat will end their lives, they have a lot of be frightened of -- pain, nausea, vomiting,\nconstipation, fatigue, their impending mortality. But what scares them\nmore than anything else is this possibility that at some point, tomorrow or a month from now, they're going to lose\ncontrol of their health, of their lives, of their healthcare, and they're going to become\ndependent on others, and that's terrifying. So it's no wonder really\nthat patients like Robin, who I just told you about, who I met in that clinic, turn to medical marijuana to try to claw back\nsome semblance of control. How do they do it though? How do these medical\nmarijuana dispensaries -- like the one where I met Robin -- how do they give patients like Robin\nback the sort of control that they need? And how do they do it in a way that mainstream\nmedical hospitals and clinics, at least for Robin, weren't able to? What's their secret? So I decided to find out. I went to a seedy clinic\nin Venice Beach in California and got a recommendation that would allow me\nto be a medical marijuana patient. I got a letter of recommendation\nthat would let me buy medical marijuana. I got that recommendation illegally, because I'm not\na resident of California -- I should note that. I should also note, for the record, that I never used that letter\nof recommendation to make a purchase, and to all of you DEA agents out there -- (Laughter) love the work that you're doing, keep it up. (Laughter) Even though it didn't let me\nmake a purchase though, that letter was priceless\nbecause it let me be a patient. It let me experience\nwhat patients like Robin experience when they go to a medical\nmarijuana dispensary. And what I experienced -- what they experience every day, hundreds of thousands\nof people like Robin -- was really amazing. I walked into the clinic, and from the moment that I entered\nmany of these clinics and dispensaries, I felt like that dispensary, that clinic, was there for me. There were questions\nat the outset about who I am, what kind of work I do, what my goals are in looking\nfor a medical marijuana prescription, or product, what my goals are,\nwhat my preferences are, what my hopes are, how do I think, how do I hope\nthis might help me, what am I afraid of. These are the sorts of questions that patients like Robin\nget asked all the time. These are the sorts of questions\nthat make me confident that the person I'm talking with\nreally has my best interests at heart and wants to get to know me. The second thing I learned\nin those clinics is the availability of education. Education from the folks\nbehind the counter, but also education\nfrom folks in the waiting room. People I met were more than happy,\nas I was sitting next to them -- people like Robin -- to tell me about who they are,\nwhy they use medical marijuana, what helps them, how it helps them, and to give me advice and suggestions. Those waiting rooms really are\na hive of interaction, advice and support. And third, the folks behind the counter. I was amazed at how willing\nthose people were to spend sometimes an hour or more\ntalking me through the nuances of this strain versus that strain, smoking versus vaporizing, edibles versus tinctures -- all, remember, without me\nmaking any purchase whatsoever. Think about the last time\nyou went to any hospital or clinic and the last time anybody spent an hour\nexplaining those sorts of things to you. The fact that patients like Robin\nare going to these clinics, are going to these dispensaries and getting that sort\nof personalized attention and education and service, really should be a wake-up call\nto the healthcare system. People like Robin are turning away\nfrom mainstream medicine, turning to medical marijuana dispensaries because those dispensaries\nare giving them what they need. If that's a wake-up call\nto the medical establishment, it's a wake-up call that many\nof my colleagues are either not hearing or not wanting to hear. When I talk to my colleagues,\nphysicians in particular, about medical marijuana, they say, \"Oh, we need more evidence. We need more research into benefits,\nwe need more evidence about risks.\" And you know what? They're right. They're absolutely right. We do need much more evidence\nabout the benefits of medical marijuana. We also need to ask the federal government\nto reschedule marijuana to Schedule II, or to deschedule it entirely\nto make that research possible. We also need more research\ninto medical marijuana's risks. Medical marijuana's risks -- we know a lot about\nthe risks of recreational use, we know next to nothing\nabout the risks of medical marijuana. So we absolutely do need research, but to say that we need research and not that we need\nto make any changes now is to miss the point entirely. People like Robin\naren't seeking out medical marijuana because they think it's a wonder drug, or because they think\nit's entirely risk-free. They seek it out because the context\nin which it's delivered and administered and used, gives them the sort of control\nthey need over their lives. And that's a wake-up call\nwe really need to pay attention to. The good news though is that\nthere are lessons we can learn today from those medical marijuana dispensaries. And those are lessons\nwe really should learn. These are often small,\nmom-and-pop operations run by people with no medical training. And while it's embarrassing to think that many of these clinics\nand dispensaries are providing services and support and meeting patients' needs in ways that billion-dollar\nhealthcare systems aren't -- we should be embarrassed by that -- but we can also learn from that. And there are probably\nthree lessons at least that we can learn\nfrom those small dispensaries. One: we need to find ways\nto give patients more control in small but important ways. How to interact with healthcare providers, when to interact\nwith healthcare providers, how to use medications\nin ways that work for them. In my own practice, I've gotten much more\ncreative and flexible in supporting my patients\nin using drugs safely to manage their symptoms -- with the emphasis on safely. Many of the drugs I prescribe\nare drugs like opioids or benzodiazepines which can be dangerous if overused. But here's the point. They can be dangerous if they're overused, but they can also be ineffective\nif they're not used in a way that's consistent with\nwhat patients want and need. So that flexibility,\nif it's delivered safely, can be extraordinarily valuable\nfor patients and their families. That's number one. Number two: education. Huge opportunities to learn from some of the tricks\nof those medical marijuana dispensaries to provide more education that doesn't require\na lot of physician time necessarily, or any physician time, but opportunities to learn\nabout what medications we're using and why, prognoses, trajectories of illness, and most importantly, opportunities for patients\nto learn from each other. How can we replicate what goes on in those clinic and medical\ndispensary waiting rooms? How patients learn from each other,\nhow people share with each other. And last but not least, putting patients first the way\nthose medical marijuana dispensaries do, making patients feel\nlegitimately like what they want, what they need, is why, as healthcare providers, we're here. Asking patients about their hopes,\ntheir fears, their goals and preferences. As a palliative care provider, I ask all my patients what they're\nhoping for and what they're afraid of. But here's the thing. Patients shouldn't have to wait\nuntil they're chronically seriously ill, often near the end of life, they shouldn't have to wait\nuntil they're seeing a physician like me before somebody asks them, \"What are you hoping for?\" \"What are you afraid of?\" That should be baked into the way\nthat healthcare is delivered. We can do this -- we really can. Medical marijuana dispensaries\nand clinics all across the country are figuring this out. They're figuring this out in ways that larger, more mainstream\nhealth systems are years behind. But we can learn from them, and we have to learn from them. All we have to do is swallow our pride -- put aside the thought for a minute that because we have\nlots of letters after our name, because we're experts, because we're chief medical officers\nof a large healthcare system, we know all there is to know\nabout how to meet patients' needs. We need to swallow our pride. We need to go visit\na few medical marijuana dispensaries. We need to figure out what they're doing. We need to figure out\nwhy so many patients like Robin are leaving our mainstream medical clinics and going to these medical\nmarijuana dispensaries instead. We need to figure out\nwhat their tricks are, what their tools are, and we need to learn from them. If we do, and I think we can,\nand I absolutely think we have to, we can guarantee all of our patients\nwill have a much better experience. Thank you. (Applause)", "K1VtZ1vqo8s": "Crete [Music] hey guys what's up welcome back I'm glad you're all here today if you happen to hear some birds chirping around the background perfect because it is springtime here in the northern hemisphere which means it's a perfect time to start to germinate seeds whether you're going to be going outdoors for the 2019 outdoor season or you're staying indoors and want new genetics or just new seedling plants for your indoor crop today I'm going to be showing you the few little things that I use and how I germinate seeds just like everything I do it's a very simple method it's something I've been doing for a really long time I think you know I think I'm on like 14 years now I'm sure there's plenty of other ways to do this and possibly better and you know just slightly easier ways to do this but this is how I do this like I said it's been successful for a long time now so today we're gonna be showing you how I germinate seeds so stay tuned alright so let's show you the little bit of equipment that we're gonna need to get these seeds up and going so obviously first things first we're gonna need some seeds so whatever a variety company strain even species you may be going with get those ready now what we're gonna be using here is banana split from the homie loci grow he started his own little breeding company here a breeding genetic company under grow genetics and they're just getting up and going he's got about six or seven crosses that are in testing right now and I was lucky enough to grab them so I could take some dope pictures and also get them kind of up and going and do some testing anyway we have the banana split which is banana punch by symbiotic genetics super hot they're crossed with ice cream man was his mail from compound genetics another super hot breeder out there so should be some serious fire in there and if you guys have been following me on instagram at green jeans garden you have seen the fire pictures before these things have even germinated as well as some other strains that got some dope pictures up so follow me at green jeans garden anyway so we have our seeds next we're gonna need a shot glass or anything really that holds some water because the first step is soaking the seeds and to go along with that we're gonna need some water simply now this is where everyone's gonna ask so what kind of water tap are oh this or that doesn't matter guys use tap use are out use what you got but whatever you use use the best you got if have RO water use it if you have clean spring water use it the idea is that it's clean water and it's neutral water and what I mean by neutral is it's somewhere in the range of upper fives at the lowest pH to around seven at the highest pH so just say Gerry generally neutral pH and you should be good to go and then once we soak the seeds we're kind of moving in the second process and that's going to be germinating them in the basic paper towel method that everyone knows and loves so that's going to consist of a paper towel and a ziplock baggie now the Ziploc baggie could also be a clone dome it could be anything that's just going to keep the paper towel from drying out too fast could even be two bowls but we'll get into that once we get going I picked pick eight of the beans that I want to germinate here save a few just in case for a rainy day you never know it so it's just kind of a we save one or two anyway got them as well as the two twin beans that I have in there photo goes up now so all we're gonna do here is we are going to put a little bit of water in there and we are going to simply drop these seeds into the water now you'll notice most of the seeds will float any that sink immediately are usually duds but they could be okay anyway just give a little little swirl and we are going to let the seeds soak for 12 hours okay so we've dropped our seeds in water we're going to let them soak for 12 hours and we let them soak for 12 hours in darkness now by dropping them in water and having generally good temperatures those are the two criteria to start the germination process light can be harmful essentially it's just really not necessary some species and strains and things do need light but overall 95% of seeds germinate the best and most successfully in darkness so as long as you have good moderate temperatures over 65 degrees under you know 80 80 82 and some moisture for the seeds to start their process they're going to germinate so what we're gonna do is we're actually just going to put these in one of these cabinets I have behind me here and come back in 12 hours [Music] ok so it's been about 16 hours now and the timeframe anywhere from you know 6 hours to 24 hours is plenty of time to get these seeds soaking and as you can see here these seeds have already sprouted tails in the shot glass now these things these are new fresh seeds very vigorous ready to go if you have some older seeds they might they probably won't sprout tails a lot of times my older seeds won't sprout tails in here which is why we actually go to this the second step of the method here the paper towel method some people will just germinate in the shot glass and honestly these seeds right here these could go straight from here to whatever your final or starter media is and probably be fine they're vigorous and ready to go but for the sake of how I always do seeds we're going to continue to take these from the sprouted tails in the shot glass here and get them into a paper towel so let's do that now okay so let's get these seeds transferred into the paper towel and it is just as easy as it may seem we are just literally just going to pour them in try not to spill them everywhere and keep them in our palm and we got one being left in there we'll just wash it on out use gravity and water and bam just don't tell my wife I'm doing it here on the counter all right once we have the seeds on the damp or moist paper towel we're just gonna fold it up maybe two three folds tops you don't need much as you can see here you can see the seeds through it we don't want it to be completely thick that we can't see through it but we want to be covered enough that it acts like you know some form of medium or soil all right so we have our seeds damp paper towel just let it drip dry give it a little ring on the edges we just want it we want it moist damp not dripping wet but obviously need some moisture for seeds act like you know pretend it's some moist cocoa or some moist soil once we have that we're gonna open up our ziploc bag or simply just gonna put it inside now this thing is like I said just acting as if it's a clone a cloned oh this is just they've always done it in ziplock baggies cuz you know they're more accessible and pretty much everyone has a sandwich bag I'm using a gallon ziplock here because to me the bigger the Ziploc the better which is why I think I cloned a clone dome works great for this situation the small Ziploc sometimes if your seeds take a while to germinate maybe they take 3 4 days to get going and they can get kind of just a funky little smell going you might want to change paper towel something like that and I've noticed a bigger a bigger Ziploc or cloned um or something like that that kind of mitigates that just a just a touch but these things are so vigorous they're only going to be in here another 12 hours or so maybe 20 for tops you'll see them and they're gonna be frickin explosive so all we're going to do is put it in here and kind of give it a little little puff give it a little air poof in there so it's got you know so the bags not laying right on on the seeds and we're going to put it right back into that dark space where we had success getting these tails out of the four so wherever that was for you go ahead and put it right back there [Music] okay so let's look at these guys all of them have have sprouted and one of the twins has sprouted one of them has not guys are looking at just some singles here look at that beautiful beautiful growth here we go and this one see that's a twin that only one has sprouted this twin both of them have sprouted guys this is a little weird [ __ ] Wiggins I'm so stoked but all the seeds looking good look at that tail fantastic so whoo okay alright guys so 24 hours after we put them into the paper towel we've now taken them out roughly 24 hours might be like 18 you know but give or take these seeds are extremely vigorous so don't expect results exactly like this I just want to clarify that right now tails popping out after 12 hours beautiful busted tails out this is just a very you know these are fresh seeds it's a vigorous strain obviously all good signs but if yours take a few days to get to get some tails sprouted this or that don't worry that's that's totally normal but once they do once you've opened them up we can transfer them from the paper towel to whatever starter medium you have so if you're gonna try to drop them into a rock wool cube that's your thing if you're putting them in soil that's your thing Pro mix whatever it may be that that's your choice at this point but we're using coco here but the you know the technique here is the same we're gonna lightly we've already buried our unburied them holes give them some nice nice spots to sprout and we're just going to lightly place each seedling in there I have eight little four-inch pots here and we have eight seedlings we're actually not going to do all of them because that twin sprouted so I got to actually go take some some great photographs and that should pop up right here and if not give me a few days and get all these potted up and nicely watered in I have one little watering technique that I'll show you once we get these in here but that's that so we are actually we're two days past once we first transplant these seedlings into their Coco medium and you can see there up there sprouted all of them even the twins that are in this bag you're going I just want to get that shell off there so I can get each one of these twins into their own own media but but yeah they're ready to go now I told you there was one little trick I have two watering and guys its watering so it's nothing revolutionary it's crazy the point of it is just when you first transplant your seeds you want to get them watered you want to get that basically that bond from the seed to that medium it kind of wants their wet it just creates that bond and to do that we want to do it gently we don't want to just flood the top here with water and let it do its thing most likely the plants to be fine honestly but you know most people are paying pretty good dollars for seeds these days ten plus dollars a seed so you want to take care of it let's just be gentle so simply what I was gonna show you is just be gentle with the water bottle that you were watering with nothing crazy um we don't want to flood or this is the kicker everyone forgets most of you guys have a pump sprayer whether it be a little hand like hairspray or thing or you actually have like a pump sprayer and this guys is the most gentle way to water in the top of your seedlings because it's a very light mist you can be very direct with it right where it needs to go and the perfect amount where it's not too not too agitating or not too too harmful for these seedlings now my only tip is that if you use your sprayer for your IPM be kind of you know pesticide or preventative anything it could be gnarly on a baby seedling just make sure you clean out your sprayer or have a dedicated clean sprayer something like that I know it might be an extra step but that is my suggestion other than that you guys should be off to the races that at this point and should be able to start feeding these plants now that they're to this point they're just starting to get their first true set of leaves you have those they're called cotyledons the leaves that don't really look like real leaves once they get past that they need some nutrients so at this point we need to give them light and we need to give them nutrients and we need to start treating them just like real plants which at this point they are if they're above the ground so whatever you're gonna do with your seedlings this year whether again if you're going outdoors for 2019 or you're staying indoors with new genetics that's how I pop and germinate I've always had fairly good success rate overall obviously these seeds are extremely vigorous new so they're kind of you know stars of the show here so don't expect identical results of the EC's work again vigorous freakin nature's but yeah you guys should be often going have some beautiful seedlings up and started and some great new genetics in your rooms or in your gardens so guys I appreciate it like this video if you liked it go ahead and just like it if you don't is what it is subscribe if you're not and I will see you guys next time whether it's a back to the basics little tutorial here or we're back in the garden guys so I appreciate it I'll see you next time for chief [Music]", "fVIclho0GoY": "[Music] yeah see i understand the purple lotus was started up you know quite different than i think a lot of other dispensaries and especially dispensaries in san jose were established it was just established by my by my wife and i was in a situation where i had a lot of money that i was coming into this with a huge investment or anything and just lost you know money doing in a business venture um it was kind of my first forte into business that lost a lot of money was credit card debt but we started up the shop with a very small amount of money about fifteen thousand dollars when i opened the shop i had you know just four jars of marijuana about a little less than two pounds of marijuana i mean this this place over here really set us off i mean you would have people flocking from all over this area to to come on a daily basis it became a community of people the landlord that i was leasing from was leasing to another dispensary upstairs so we had we had competition up there and all humility you know they were closed within about three months of us being there um you know we just my motto was to reinvest that product you know i sold the original product and then i made the sacrifice didn't hire anybody i worked for a year straight just myself right there every day all day and just put all the money back in the product and that increased business and so many people were such strong advocates because they saw what we were about which was first of all people love great cannabis they love great wheat so we had great weed at the good price and then we were good people we got more involved in the community and because people came every day we became you know they became part of our lives we became part of theirs also when we first moved in here i mean i would park up here every day and then at night time i would take the bud with me inside ikea bags for the first maybe three months because i didn't really have a good safe situation so i would take it with me at the end of the night bring all the cannabis back with me the next morning i said this was popping up here as much as i like to at the time say that they weren't you know people smoking people you know a lot going on up here in the parking lot we ended up needing to get a guard up here to ensure that everything was all cool everything was all cool but they came from every which way they came by car they came by bike scooter walking because these apartments right here and all this area around here you know the bus stops right there this was a community right here people are proud to say that they came here to jackson you hear people say oh i've been coming here since jackson great great great memories from this place fought hard to stay here you know didn't work out but uh this will always be the original [Music] spot we barely squeaked into our next location over on lundy it was it was a rough move i mean it was not a successful situation at all it's very tough to get somebody to lease to us during that time it's not like now it's still very federally legal and people are really concerned we paid six months in advance and got the place over here and once again from day one we had issues um you know just especially in this place this has a shared uh it's an office building uh as a shared air conditioning unit by this time we were carrying a large supply of marijuana and uh the whole buildings just stunk like even though this is not far away people felt like it was far away so this was always a place where we were waiting for white road this is you know we had white road that we were building out while we were here so we struggled through this place they wanted to evict us from day one we fought through that and ended up staying for six months while the business i don't think grew a lot of customers during that time what we did is we grew a lot of resilience during that time we used to tell them hey uh you'll find this over by the loading dock you know you know that's i believe at one point we ran an extension cord from way over here down to the street just so that we could sit there and put a light out so that people could know that we could tell them that there's a light down there because it was so dark you would miss this because this is a building that closes at nighttime except for if you're selling wheat up here then it closes a lot later [Music] this was the nicest place we had built out beautiful place it was formally been a bar and we just made it really nice restored the bar had it all set up to serve it was really right in the middle of where at that point a good portion of our patient base was that opened up people were lined out everybody they were fighting to be the first person to say that they were the first person to come through the door um you know my mom came to pictures of all of us so happy to be opening up this great location we have been working for months to get it we didn't have a lot of money evicted from the other spot this other spot unlucky wasn't working out so you know we got this set up big day our biggest day ever still had the other location open but pushing most of the people down here feeling great eight o'clock sheriff's come tell us we need to close this it just happens to be this whole area is san jose and this corner right here out of all this area annexed to the county and the city had given us a business license for the address but it still fell underneath the county zone and the county at that time it had a ban on all cannabis activity even though san jose city allowed it this was a beautiful place we put all of our resources into and they closed this place down right here it was a big blow it hurt especially after only being open for about 10 hours [Music] you know 903 was was a blessing i didn't see it at the time but blessings come hidden and you know looking at the spot there's only about eight parking spots assigned to us but see how you can make that work especially with the employees and you know us needing parking we ended up uh leasing a little spot next door for parking um and making it work we put four or five security guards there at about a 50-yard uh uh distance and they just funnel people in and out in and out in and out it was a 4 20 weekend hey what year we moved in over there and uh it was actually it was a convention there's a big hemp con or something in town and uh we did 42 42.8 you know out the door and by that time we had built our our our venue up to 30 or 35 strains good bud 42 out the door and it you know it worked so well that we just kept it moving from there we just decided hey this works and we just kept on doing it and we kept on selling at 42.8 and it became just very popular we got to the point that it was you know we were running five six hundred people a day in through what was a 600 square foot retail sales floor with eight parking spots i'll tell you man one christmas day we're the only shop open man lined up from here all the way down to the head man waiting to get inside the facility we were the only club open on christmas we've been we never closed from the first day we opened we never closed we never been closed for one day we've been open for i think it's coming up on 4 000 days in a row no matter what happened we opened almost 4 000 days in a row [Music] listen lou gehrig type street [ __ ] you know what i mean you started talking about that you know with iron man because iron man [Music] you", "j-FFcCKEEi8": "what's going on guys it's your boy sam from sammy cbd tv welcome back welcome back to everybody uh you know let's get you popping right like old times right all right guys today i got a review coming at you with the white cbg from a company known as nothing other than the main company called the diet dank cbg white white cbg diet dank guys this company i was introduced to uh by green point c company it's an absolute it is like an astonishing company um green point seed company i highly recommend them for any of you cultivators out there all right so why don't i just give you i'm gonna give you a little bit of a bust down i'm gonna i always like to i like to see what the company says in their description just so you guys know what they're bringing to the table okay so let's check it out white cbg hemp flower is an incredible popular among the hemp consumers the dense buds boasts an attractive ray of colors beneath the white trichome blanket a lot of you guys know cbg has got that white look to it um and it's always a little drier i've noticed out of all the strains in the past that i've ever smoked or vaped um this is an indica dominant strain guys so let me get right back into it all right so notably white cbg contains extremely low thc levels while maintaining a potent cannabinoid profile in fact white cbg contains up to 20 cbg and has thc percentages well below 0.3 hemp threshold as such consuming this indica dominant health cultivator will not cause anyone to feel high though it may make them feel a whole lot better anyway so cbg is one of over 100 cannabinoids guys um you guys know one of my favorite cannabinoids is cbn okay cbg is an especially exciting cannabinoid because it's the precursor to all the other cannabis based cannabinoids um it is the first cannabinoid to develop in the residence trichomes of the hemp flower okay so it usually transforms into other cannabinoids like thc then cbd throughout a process called cannabidrolic acid synthesis okay so you'll find perfect balance of cbg in white cbg they're claiming strains such as these have exceptionally high cbd levels because growers can allow them to develop cannabinoids while into the season without risking much thc development so they're saying it's skunky creamy pine aromas okay so it's an indica dominant hemp variety that features dense colorful buds coated in milky white trichomes mild odors producing a faint hint of fresh earth pine lemon and cilantro its most dominant terpenes include migraine pinene carotene and visible oh notably this unique profile combines nicely to create a relaxed while clear-headed experience just what i like to see and just what i like to hear right guys um indoor ground so it's exceptionally smooth causing a slight heat in the back of the throat a strong citrus flavor [Music] consume an after dessert or pleasant compliment to an early cup of joe despite its missing psychiatric properties consumers often find themselves feeling relaxed and better focused clutter-free mine that's what's up i have to uh no all jokes aside but guys we're gonna see what this is all about i'm actually kind of interested now that they're uh you know saying all these things about it all right guys so let's check it out let me bring this little closer to you one second one second boom check that out you like how that's that focus game i don't see anybody else's cameras on youtube looking like that boy all right i'm happy to be back you know i miss you guys much love much love we got some great reviews coming up front guys i've had this um five leaf wellness uh barry cross sitting in my like bedroom for like almost a week now i will get to it i'm sorry that'll be next i promised this one like a long time ago so i'm just trying to go in order again right so i'm getting that cilantro hempy it actually smells pretty pretty good all right not bad let's check it out guys that's the um that's not bad wow there's definitely a lot of trichomes on there wow yeah that's that's definitely got some trichomes on there you can't really tell first until you get it close and light let me uh let me just i'm gonna break it open a little bit oh wow i find it smelling like cilantro and grass but it's got this really nice hint of something in there guys it's like deep in there i'm getting that i think it's the citrus hold on man it does have citrus guys you gotta like really break it open though to really get it like i'm not gonna front like it's not strong but when you get it it's there oh man this [ __ ] smells so good all right so naturally it breaks down like with no effort i mean it's it's on the drier side i've had this for a while though too so you know look at that look at that look at that piece hanging on my nose but you know for real this [ __ ] was like you know it's a little dry but uh like i said i've had it for a little while now so guys i'm gonna be vaping this bad boy today because i want to know what it's all about as far as clean hit all right guys i'm going to be using the uh get high as an hi this is my get high vaporizer it's got the uh joint right there so one two 3 4 5. all right so as you can see the uh the green see it it's actually heating up currently right now yo when you guys get a moment because i had to listen to uncopyrighted music for my uh video because all like it's crazy because people are just heated up so i can't talk anymore all right guys let's see what it's all about cbg man cbg [Music] make it it's got like a really smooth wow i'm starting to feel now it's like it's right here it has that citrus taste guys it's got that real green like i'm talking like green green that's not bad i'm just gonna do that one that's that one ball pack this for this round because this [ __ ] is it's pretty official i could feel it already it's just creeping in there like real calming now not like super crazy or nothing as far as like making me anxious and [ __ ] yo some strains though y'all [ __ ] that i'm just gonna be honest crazy you know what i mean like i wouldn't even mess with them i wouldn't even mess with them man that is that's not bad though that's really not bad guys i might just kind of i kind of think this is pretty good white cbg dieting keep out of the reach of children consult your health care oh wow am i pregnant or nursing nope that's not bad guys so like i said this is a indica dominant [Music] strain huh we have other cbg strains too wow let me check that out i actually didn't even know that oh excuse me guys thank you alright huh wow guys i just i well now okay honestly i feel super calm right now like actually it's kind of it's quite a little it's quite pleasant i thought it would make me anxious truthfully but i'm gonna check this let me just dial in here see what we got we'll see it says within average resting range so you know i'm not getting the heart racing guys it's not making me very anxious maybe a tad anxious but most of it's in my head because a lot of you guys know i took a break from doing reviews so this is pretty cool listen to this guy so inactive in its acidic form cannabinoids like cbga become decarboxylated when heated altering their chemical structure most of you guys know that when you're making edibles you need to decarboxylate the flower first before you do it that way it's activated okay so cbda turns into cbd thca turns into thc okay so non-acidic cbg really binds to both cb1 and cb2 receptors throughout the body and may help regulate endocannabinoid signaling though cbg is not psychoactive it may help regulate the levels and reduce thc high that accompanies marijuana consumption uh it's a quick solution to marijuana over indulgence so apparently they're claiming that if you have too much thc you can use the cb g oh i really didn't know i didn't actually some of the stuff i didn't know about cbg like i said you guys know i'm ultra familiar with cbd thc et cetera cbn as well but cbg i wasn't 100 sure i did a review in the past about it but excuse me wow that is what the strains doing to me i feel like licking my eyes i feel like this super like calm dude i'm not gonna lie guys i was very very nervous okay i'm just gonna turn that music off because i want to be 100 real with you guys i was so freaking nervous to do review because my last experience with that cbd hemp flower i got the skywalker strain from plain jane and it just sent me into a full-blown panic attack um the one before that that set the tipping point like basically once i had this one strain from there on out panic attacks all the time a lot of you guys and i know a lot of you guys can uh you know that what's the word for that relate you can relate to what i'm saying because you know you know um so basically secret nature's secret dream strain sent me into a full-blown massive panic attack it is a sativa strain i freaked i mean i literally walked inside ripped my shirt off i went up to my girl said yo i think i'm gonna have a heart attack i think i'm dying um i was so so scared guys and you know what it makes me want to tear up because i'm being for real like you can't make that [ __ ] up and a lot of you guys are like [ __ ] or uh cbd's diet weed it's like first of all i'm gonna tell you right now that secret dream strain that i got through either it was the terpene profile or they definitely pushed through some stuff that was above the legal limit whatever okay i used to be a full-blown marijuana advocate i used to love thc and all that guys i can't use the anymore um only for the simple fact that it caused me to have psychosis um i got some synthetic k2 stuff guys if you don't know um it sent me to a full-blown psychosis state from there on out i couldn't smoke cigarettes i couldn't walk fast i couldn't do anything to elevate my heart rate it made me always think i was having a heart attack um when i used that k2 spice guys my heart rate went up to 196. okay that is terrifying okay terrifying so you know from there on out i couldn't do that and uh you know that secret dream strain really woke something up my mind from like that moment from years ago because i was i was panicking all the time guys like all the time you know so whatever it was i'm not gonna lie it made me freaking nervous um but anyway so basically i got the skywalker strain then from plain jane and it did the same thing um why did it do that i don't know so i just wanted you guys to know that if you guys are thc sensitive individuals okay like i had become later on in life um really check the thc a um in most strings okay a lot of people like the cbc along with the cbg and i got the delta eight vape cards and the delta eight this and that if you have a sensitivity to th e do not use delta eight at all okay common sense don't do it you're gonna freak the [ __ ] out you don't want to do that to yourself okay if you're sensitive to i can't say cbd because no one's really sensitive to cbd however well they're sorry man this this strain makes me tired so all those strains literally have thc in them okay the legal limit hence the legal limit so even though it's cbd hemp flour there's still some thc in it so if you are really that sensitive to thc like you like i am you really guys need to be careful for real i do not want to see anybody freak the [ __ ] out kill themselves jump in front of a bus because you're going through that crazy panic phase where you literally think you're really dying okay um i'm here for you guys if you ever need a friend to talk to comment down below all you guys know me i give away as much as i can in fact i'm having a two ounce giveaway coming up i'm gonna give two ounces to one individual okay two freaking ounces okay i might even do that not tomorrow but the next day okay i'm gonna give away two ounces to someone that really is in need okay um but anyway because i'm mumbling now to go back to what i was saying is you really got to be careful about the the tolerance problem okay guys um i don't want to see anybody freak out like for real so if that's the case i'd recommend the cbg because i didn't know that cg actually can bring down the thc high it's kind of interesting actually in fact i'm going to look more into cooler uh more other indica cbg strings because i really like this they use one freaking ball pack dude and it's got me going like a mug like i'm gonna show you another i'm gonna give you another picture of this little tiny this nug and how it looks okay so check that out you see that look at that you can see the frost look at this like frost balls protruding from it it's kind of insane wow this is dry see that you see it turned to dust that's interesting anyways guys it's your boy sam thanks for tuning in for another review i really appreciate it means a lot to me i enjoy everybody tuning in and thanks for thanks for always being there for me guys i took a break um some new some new people on youtube uh they're doing big things right now you know i i would have been a lot further i would probably have almost double as many subscribers as i did if i didn't stop making videos and staying in the algorithm but i had to do what i had to do for me but just know i'm back so guys if you're new to my channel like comment subscribe click the bell i got hundreds of videos you guys can browse through at any given time one of my favorite companies in the beginning was tweedle farms um not top notch like out of this world but they are consistent um it's outdoor or sun grown or greenhouse grown i mean their cush hemp was out of this world their suzy q was one of the best strains i've ever had huge freaking buds like it was huge um it was a great suzy q was a great strain i like i love that stream a lot of you guys ask me on a daily basis you message me on my facebook page guys by the way go check out sami cbd facebook page you guys can uh check out my uh stuff my favorite strain was tropical breeze from five leaf wellness um i'm gonna purchase their indoor bubble kush uh because i i love bubba kush so i'm excited to see what they're indoors all about but yeah check them out guys five leaked wellness shout out to bobby bobby the man i just talked to him a couple days ago he's a really good guy we talk on and off i talked to him about half a year ago he's a good dude he's a good dude i look forward to uh well i won't talk about it

just need to - I'm gonna take off like a [ __ ] water splash you know how to me I witness this ya seen it happen rising on the rocks I want everybody to send me their videos if they be doing pausing on the rocks like like the blush like negative and my point please you know what I mean we've been doing this is just now we got a name for it put the rocks that's a mean one that's a mean all we gotta do is wait a minute wait a minute and they'll be diving in the rising on the rocks Kem's we've got just witness that I could be a shirt I could be a shirt comment down below if you wear that shirt rosin on the rocks lots of mean shirt Oh especially no pot heads doing that they don't even know was rising in diamonds right now shout out to you at home if you know was rising and died Nicole

gotta make oil I clipping the blind oh when they lift up oh because you might not notice then you get resin on your like this we are", "-VzHBMDntHg": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another cali kosher video i ended up going to authentic again and i picked up some of their zerbert sauce i will post the video of me opening it i did open it but i didn't try it yet so uh basically on camera you're gonna get my initial reaction to the wax hopefully the lighting is good uh it's pretty dark outside i mean that's all right uh but yes serbert sauce let's read some of this stuff it is a hybrid 73.09 percent thc with cannabinoids total up to 83.93 percent uh cbd not determined uh manufactured date 619 2020. yeah and then package 6 25 20 20. all that stuff i bought it authentic for i believe it was 29 they did have lemon lemon something still but that was one of their old strains of the cali kosher so they sold it for 25 this might have been 27 i don't know could be wrong actually let me see all right so [Music] cali kosher was 25 so i'm gonna be using my inhilco e straw this one uh is pretty much a little bit clogged i haven't been i didn't even clean at all since i got it but uh usually with the first one i usually run it just to have it run and uh heat up and unclog itself so yeah [Music] so just like the other way i'm going to basically get some dab on to this so i don't waste all my dab because usually when you just dip this all in your wax it leaves a stain and it's very unappealing all right let's try that so set that up you guys probably seen this by now it did look less than a gram but let's see so all right i'm gonna take about two hits i'm probably gonna finish it off with a utilian hit why not right because i don't think uh with this you can only do it uh there's like you got to wait like a minute in between hits [Music] that's pretty lacking well the taste is not bad um what is this screen oh the strain is uh sherbet all right let's try this again cheers boys it is on the red i really do need to char this charge this full way but i'm treating it oh that was tasty [Music] i really didn't give it too much justice on here i mean it was a pretty all decent hit but let me finish off the review with the utilian the trusty old utilian thing so it's right here very very um how you describe that flavor i don't know it's a very it definitely tastes like wheat like uh it it tastes like the the strain or not the strain i don't know i haven't tried sherbet in its flower form but like it tastes like flour i had to uh compare it to anything but we're gonna take this last hit i'm gonna blow it towards the the light for you guys just to show you guys that we getting smoke here [Music] so with that i'm probably gonna take one more hit for you guys but as far as this wax goes for 25 dollars not bad i would say it tastes very similar to the other cali kosher like i've tried cali koshers that tasted like this before but i would say this is a more stronger taste it's a very og earthy [ __ ] pungent smell or like taste i don't i don't really know how to describe it but you're definitely gonna get caught up if you smoke this [ __ ] like it lingers the smell lingers so just let you know you're you're warned so definitely doesn't smell like it or tastes like it smells when i smell it it does smell like like a like a light fruitiness to it but when i'm inhaling or when i'm dabbing it it doesn't actually necessarily give up the same that it smells just weird usually it tastes somewhat similar you know so let's try this last hit hopefully you guys have been enjoying the content lately and i'm saying i've been doing my best to uh just upload um constantly you know that way you know you guys always have something to watch you know especially in these times and age when just [ __ ] is boring you know people can't go out people can't do [ __ ] you know youtube's being watched more so why not make more videos you know so cheers boys [Music] so look all right guys that's it for the video hopefully you enjoyed the video you know what i'm saying i do have a new wax that i haven't tried yet so be on the lookout for that subscribe you know click that bell all that good stuff if you haven't already i'll see you guys in the next one peace out [Music] you", "F4b7F0n7_KI": "hey guys today we are talking about every type of hydroponic systems their strengths and weaknesses if you're thinking about getting into hydroponics the goal of this video is to talk about and let you guys know about each and every type of hydroponic system so you know which system works best for you we have a lot to go over so let's get started when we were talking about hydroponics we are talking about any plant that has grown without soil this could mean it's being grown in rock wall gravel liquid hydroton or cocoa fabric pot with coco coir mix with perlite is technically a hydroponic setup it may look like soil but it is not coco coir is made from the fibers of coconuts and perlite is chunks of volcanic glass this alternative medium which does not contain significant chemicals minerals organism is what makes it hydroponic a lot of people are choosing hydroponics because growing in soil can lead to a lot of random chemical concentrations minerals insects bacterias and other factors that cannot be controlled whether good or bad a hydroponic setup allows you to feed your plants to exact mixture of nutrients for a well balanced feed it's been proven that a hydroponic system can be incredibly rewarding for monster yields and a shorter grow cycle another great advantage of hydroponics is that you can automate your light and watering schedule this is going to free up your day and minimize your maintenance on your grow so there are three main types of hydroponic systems there's Evan flow there is drip and then there is deep water culture Evan flow this method is super reliable and is used in a lot of commercial grows what it basically is is your plants it and a tray that's suspended over a reservoir your tray and reservoir is connected via a pump and once or twice a day the pump will send nutrient-rich water into your tray flooding it once that's done the pump will turn off and the tray will drain back into the res our hydroponic systems are flexible and can come in different irrigation methods the nutrient film technique or nft also falls under the ebb and flow category and an N of T system a trough holding your plants and suspended over your reservoir at a slight incline the top of the trough is connected to a pump that will send water to the top to float down to the end draining back into your reservoir along the way a water all of your plants and NFT system is great for smaller plants like lettuce or herbs but has a harder time supporting bigger plants so here are the strengths and weaknesses of an ebb and flow systems for its strength it's very reliable there are very few moving parts which means there's less maintenance and repair they're also very easy to setup and you it's very easy to inspect that all your plants are getting fed at the same time the drawbacks of an ebb and flow system is that it uses the most water out of the three hydroponic system just because it needs to flood the entire grow tray this also means you'll be using more nutrition to match the water ratio if you're in a drought inclined area like California this could be a pricey option also remember that your evan flow system has to be above a reservoir if you're going in a smaller tent or have a lower ceiling just could be a challenge because the raised plants may come in close contact with your lights and can result in heat stress or light burn all right drip systems just like your ebb and flow system your plants won't need to be above a reservoir from the reservoir a pump is connected to a hose that branches out to tinier little hoses that go directly to your plants to feed them water and nutrients from there the water that runs off from your plant goes directly or drains back directly to reservoir making it a recirculating system so a drip system is like the versa grow system and a slightly more unorthodox system would be like the window farm system I made a few videos ago and of course you can always build your own out of polyurethane tubing the principles are very similar a drip system is great for fitting a large number of plants plus it uses the least amount of water compared to other hydroponic systems that means lower water bills and using less nutrition the drawbacks of a drip system is that it has more components to it it's going to take more time to install because you have to connect each of these little hoses to the main hose and then you have to make sure that each of these outlets is directly at your plant depositing water to it and over time these little hoses can also get clogged due to natural build-up that means you have to routinely check that your hoses are fully going and flowing and between each grow you actually have to flush out the hoses with a cleaning solution to reduce that build-up that we were just talking about okay for a little ass hydroponic system we have deep water culture system a or a TWC a DW C system is a self-contained system that's designed to feed one plant in each individual bucket there will be an airstone that provides a constant oxygen supply to the plants roots so they don't drown in the water the plant is placed inside of a net or fabric pot which sits on top of each bucket by having the plant sit in a nutrient bath that is constantly being supplied with oxygen the plant can have access to food at any given second like any other hydroponic system there are lots of different variants and forms of deep water culture systems there are recirculating d WCS where all of the buckets are connected to a network that is controlled by a brain bucket for larger perpetual growth there are DW c-raf systems where the entire grow tray is flooded and aerated 24/7 while the plants are grown on top of a wrap that sits above the water but for the sake of not complicating things we will be talking about the traditional single bucket dwc system the advantage of having a DW C system is that your plants we'll have a dramatic increase in yield and you'll see a huge production of root systems to help it and take all the nutrients it submerged in a dwc system is great for gross who can only have a few number of plants but want to maximize their yield this system is also ideal for grow spaces with limited ceiling heights a DWC system is amazing for incredible yield but it does have a few of its own drawbacks a DWC plant because it's constantly submerged in a nutrient bath it's very reluctant to be transplanted into soil or a solid medium just because of the roots has never built up a tolerance to be put in a solid medium another drawback is that you must always always always have an extra water pump or an air pump on hand at all times if an air pump fails a whole entire crop cannot as quick as 48 hours because if there isn't a constant supply of oxygen to the root system a plant can suffocate within days under big concern is that if you're generating a lot of co2 in your grow room you must pump air from outside of your grow room because pumping co2 into your root system is a fatal mistake your disease is also a huge concern when growing in a dwc system because your plants are constantly submerged in a recirculating system your water temperatures must be maintained at 62 to 68 Fahrenheit anywhere above 72 Fahrenheit and you risk cultivating root disease and also dissolve oxygen levels drop dramatically anywhere below 60 Fahrenheit and your you risk your plants metabolic rates changing dwc system is more for an advanced grower who can recognize and diagnose plant problems quickly a dwc system has a lot of benefits but it has its own complications and that's all through hydroponic systems how they work and their strengths and weaknesses I'll do a quick recap on all the hydroponic systems so that you know which system is best for you keep in mind the each situation is different and these hydroponic systems are flexible but these are just the general outlines evan flow systems are great hydroponic systems because of its minimal costs and needs it's easy to set up and automate with very little adjustment needed to get the system working right it uses a lot of water versus two other grow systems and it generally uses a larger grow room or grow ten so if water is a concern then go with it automated drip system with a hydroton as the grow medium you can constantly feed your plants with a small stream of water without the fear of over watering the roots are constantly aerated because they're being fed from the top down and drained back out which pulls air into the root system just be careful not to use any organic nutrients that can clog up your tubes scheduled maintenance checks are required for drip systems this system requires a medium to large grow area as well so if space is an issue a deep water culture system is the next best option this is an awesome single plant setup because a DWC system are self-contained in their own bucket each of your plants roots are submerged and nutrient rich aerated water the aeration comes from an air pump that pulls air through the air zone into the bucket the little air bubbles are trapped in the root systems so your plants don't drown yes plants can drown they yield on a perfectly tuned ewc system are massive but with the advantage also comes with its own complications a DW C's must have its air pumps constantly working if the pump fails and goes unnoticed all of your plants can die rapidly don't let these challenges stop you from trying a hydroponic system the harvest from a hydroponic system is highly rewarding in general you'll get a higher yield a better quality and a faster harvest time to get you guys sir I'm going to give you 10% off your entire purchase when you

cake strain so now we're going to try out the san fernando valley o.g kush i think this is a good one to follow up on last week's bow valley og from ogen it did incredibly well with that high turret percentage i'm curious how endiva is going to do with this new release we've got an intro to get in here first and then we're going to dive in by walking you through exactly how we're doing this review cheese you guys and i'll see you over there [Music] welcome back you guys and for those of you who are new to the channel welcome to checking out this review today we're going to be doing something in the lines of a classic writerly video with our one hitter weed review the way we do this is we cover the information that the container provides for us first and foremost and then we move over to the website today i have the diva website pulled up this is my preferred place to get information from the actual lps that grow the bud for us they give us the most direct and accurate information for each of the phenos that they're producing ogen we i like going there for that bow valley og where this is the san fernando valley og from indiva they have a little bit of different characteristics a little bit of a different flavor palette so they're going to describe them differently within diva we've got that website pulled up so i'm very excited to go into that information before we get smoking once we do finish covering the little bit of information that is provided we get into the actual review the meat and potatoes of this video first things first we start out with the look and aroma we crack the lid we smell what the butt has to offer we take a look we give it a score out of a 10. after that we move into a baked rendition of the experience through our vuber not our viewer about the cfc vaporizer i'm thinking we're doing a 510 review today you guys our boundless cfc vaporizer we've got three temperatures i set it at each have a unique terpene presentation and flavor that i go into full details when we get to this side of the review the bongs follow the same idea as the vaporizer here with three different lighting ways and sizes through our bong so each of those provide a little bit of a different experience and again full details when we get to that part of the review now the final two steps of the smoking side are a little bit simpler they're going to be your more classic renditions and that's through our pipe here with the regal slim and then i roll up a elements based joint since i seem to like the elements paper with our store bought bud and an ocb or a hemp's organic raw with our home grow so elements are going to be the papers we use today you guys with all of that each of those smoking points are gonna be scored out of 10 like the look in aroma and then our final out of ten scoring is going to be for the high that will be the way we end up wrapping up this review to getting our total out of 60 48 is the number we want to hit 48 is what provides us with that beautiful urban score right now we have one but that has made it that far since we've um renewed and updated our scale to make it a little bit more realistic and a little bit of a tougher one to beat with that you guys the san fernando valley og kush has some potential i've enjoyed a couple of the strains that i've picked up and tried from it but now we can actually get into this review and start covering the information so the san fernando valley og kush is going to be a thc stomper at 24.7 percent nice and high for this strain it is going to be sativa dominant on the container that we have here but i believe the website describes as an indica dominant strain so you guys it's a goddamn hybrid and we're just going to refer to it as such for this review we have a cbd total of 0.08 percent we have a package date of the 28th of december 2020 so the flickering last days of the last year we have a price point of 39.99 on this eighth before tax which honestly just over that ten dollars a gram i can justify picking this up to give it a shot now we'll move over to the indiva website cover that information real quick and then we can get into the fun part of the review you guys so san fernando valley og kush indica dominant hybrid so it is going to lean on that indica side san fernando valley o.g kush is a cross between san fernando valley og and afghani kush this indica dominant hybrid has high thc and terpene potency with heavy citrus earthy and fruity notes with a hint of green apple they still have this mark that's coming soon but obviously i've got it in hand so it's on the market now that's all the information that endeeva does provide for us for the strain so that means we can get our urban scale intro in here you guys and start rocking five minutes into this review and we're already in the urban scale i'm not complaining let's keep this pace up cheers and i'll see you over there welcome back you guys and like i said we're gonna cruise right into the look and aroma on this spot so let's take the top of this butt off this container this buds container open the lid and see what we have to play with with the san fernando valley o.g kush from indiva they have a really nice protect your uh sealed for your protection cover on here however the container is a little bit excessive in my opinion now oh i am definitely getting a lot more citrus and almost kind of a gassy tone off of this bud really really nice rich potent tone it's definitely got that kind of humid experience that a good like deep um aroma has this one leans a little bit more to that citrus gassy onset and then just that raw kind of musky humidity that muggy humidity afterwards that reminds me of a really good cushy strain going off of aroma without touching the buds and just seeing the size of these guys i'm leaning an 8. now if the buds on the dryer side we're gonna end up bumping it down to a seven i'm just gonna let you guys know that we will dump this entire eighth out so that you guys can see exactly what we have to play with i'm gonna flip the camera over show you guys quickly talk about it and then we'll give it its final score whether it's gonna be a seven or an eight today you guys so now as you can see we did end up just going with a bunch of smaller nugs but the consistency of the trim throughout is really nice now on the dryness side let's see okay i would say it's no drier than the bow valley og that i got from ogen so that in and of itself will be beneficial for this plant but i am going to say honestly this san fernando valley og kush strain because the bow valley og is ogen's pheno of it it's just a bud that tends to be on that drier side and i honestly am thinking it is a structural thing of this bud and honestly the sativa the more genetic based sativas where they're actually more open leaf like you can see these guys are fanned right out they're not really dense little rocks like you'd expect with a true kush or indica based grow but you are left with a really nice pushy pungent aroma so i will give this a 7 out of 10 for the overall experience it's just with that ogen's bow valley that we smoked last week the aroma on that one was just a half a step better and that's really what it is like if this was if i had point fives in my scores this would be a seven and a half because it's just that half a step the nugs were a little bit bigger so when we busted them up they were a little bit fresher like it's just those kind of points that knock it down that single one from the eight to the seven now i'm gonna go ahead and bust these nugs up get our vaporizer packed up so we can start smoking right away you guys let's go ahead bust this up roll up the joint and i'll be right back with you guys thankful to the power of editing because it's just gonna be a split second and i'll see you over there okay guys so we're gonna go ahead and just finish up the nice little tucks on this joint to make it smoke a little bit smoother for us when we get into it but now we're going to dive into our vaporizer we're going to start things off at 175 degrees celsius the reason we start out at that temperature is the lemonine and the meristening terpenes now the fact that this bud has a really potent and rich citrus aroma that's coming off of it i'm really excited for that lemonade at the 175. it gives off a nice lemon citric very acidic style of an experience through the vaporizer at the 175 but with that meristening playing a role in there as well you could end up getting a little bit more of that earthy sometimes wooded but very much so vegetative experience you guys so you can get almost like a rainforest humid humid vegetative experience a lemongrass you can even swing in as far as that juicy mango kind of an experience of the maracinine playing off of the lemonade's flavor as well lemongrass lemon wood citronella all of those flavors they are very very common at the 175. now 205 that is where we're going to get our rich potent abundantly present terpenes playing factors and starting to boil off because 205 is where we get the majority of the other terpenes boiling off and starting to make some key presentations on the flavor they experience everything along those lines you get your rich creamy chocolatey cheesy cushy all those potent experiences 205's the bucket to be uh blending in 220 now that's where we finish it off thc and beta keraline are the two main reasons for that we'll start out with the thc heaviest offload up from the plant because of the boil off temperature of the thc as well as the most heavy effects because you get the most thc boiling off at around that 220 degrees celsius beta carefully it's going to be the most predominant terpene and flavor that i experience and that you guys will experience at 220 degrees celsius it's going to be very much a pepper or wooded based experience and honestly you guys it typically does lean into a complementary offset of what the first 175 is just because we're at the far end and that's what i've been finding with the last couple of strains that we've been smoking so i'm hoping that this one kind of falls along the same line where it's nice progressive change from 175 all the way up to 220 but i have it on it's currently heating its way up the way we tell with this boundless cfc vaporizer is there's going to be a little tea cup that pops up beside this when it hits the 175 you guys are going to see it i'll just hold it here let you see boom teacup ready steam i'm i'm having some fun with this one you guys let's see how the vaporizer does we'll give you little hints and notes as we're working our way through it cheers definitely gassy very very rich gassy flavor i can taste the humidity there too like i can feel that humidity definitely encourages more of a mouth-watering experience that's then so much so a kind of hearty searching for kind of flavor it's just it's a potent enough flavor that's got my mouth watering it is definitely that citric citrusy gassy push definitely more of the acidic side the lemon lime the grapefruit those sharp citrus flavors an alright experience not really feeling much the 175. we're going to bump up to the 205 see if we can start to feel some some of the high that'll start to come out from this talk about a little bit then we'll go into the flavors that the 205 offers the experience that 205 offers so last two hauls at the 175 i was starting to get a little bit of kind of a a hearty flavor at the end almost wooded almost spiced that's now the forefront of this flavor very wooded very spiced very much a nice smooth smoke honestly guys it took that acidic flavor out of the um of that initial experience it just kind of put in almost a rich creamy sweet flavor almost so much so that it's leaning that berry style of this sweet which wasn't something i was expecting but it's a good compliment to that really hearty swampy kind of uh humid flavor i'm getting now 220 this is where we finish it off at let's see what we have to experience here and again the 205 not really much of an experience a little bit of a head rush but not much i can definitely feel more of that head rush coming in and the 220 is just a very lightened version of the 205 you guys it seems like the kind of wood undertone just kind of slows everything down makes it a nice slow build kind of a flavor like as i'm sitting here the flavors building up on my tongue post versus it being strong at the beginning and blending out that way all in all i'm impressed with the san fernando valley og kush from indiva i will say that now i can't give it anything higher than a seven it's got some very nice and interesting points it's got some very nice and interesting flavors but by no means does it just pound out enjoyment you guys and that's really what i'm looking for to give that eight nines and tens is that pure enjoyment and just ah when i'm smoking vaporizer didn't quite have that but now we're going to move into our bongs let's quickly cover how we're going to do that so first we're going to have our envy straight pipe that you guys will see right away and we'll light it up with our hemp wick this is going to be our slowest burning lowest temp experience for our bongs it also ends up meaning that we milk this bong the most it's got the shortest tube the least amount of air it really does allow for the most rich and potent experience that's the hemp work through our first rig second one we go ahead and we take the clipper lighter and we run it through our nice glass beaker bong standard size bong standard lighter most often the typical way that you're gonna consume this bud is going to be our second hoot and then before we wrap the sucker up we take our jet lighter right here and we run it with our last rig that's going to allow us to hit it at the highest temperature the quickest cherry fastest snap and usually some of the most abundant flavors although i've had good flavors in each of these tiers of experiences you guys but with that being said i have done plenty of talking hyping this up let's go ahead pack up this first ball snap it back so we can work our way through the other two before we start talking about it and giving it a score out of 10. honestly i'm i'm hoping for that nice rich humid almost fresh gut fresh cut grass experience that i got with the bow valley i'm hoping it's similar with this and if it is it'll score well you guys but with that being said let's start smoking cheers [Music] [Music] so [Music] cheers [Music] so 7 out of 10 the taste from a bomb honestly this is the the biggest thing that i'm going to be doing through this entire review is i'm comparing it to how that bow valley og hit now bow valley og through the bong one of my favorite strains that have come through the bong as of late like 2021 so far that bow valley and the dream school the ice cream cake for mediva the those three are probably the three that i've been loving on the most through 2021 now the san fernando valley og kush from indiva it is a tear below that bow valley og has a really nice strong flavor to it but it doesn't hold the intensity of that flavor the way that the valley did the bow valley made my tongue and mouth water like it felt like my tongue was sweating that's how much saliva was being produced just because of the potent flavor that was coming off of that bomb you guys really nice experience really good flavor all in all the san fernando valley og kush it hits it gets it going but but it's it's nothing overwhelming it doesn't make me go holy [ __ ] i need to smoke another it's like okay i can enjoy this that's where the sevens are coming from you guys it's enjoyable but it's just not quite there now we've got a pipe we don't got our pipe i'll pick that [ __ ] up we'll pack it up and we'll go ahead and smoke it because that's the next step in this review now there you have it try not to drop it again let's get into this you guys i will give this an 8 out of 10 for the taste from a pipe though it really took off there it had a really nice strong sour flavor that took that wood experience and just extended onto it it just added that nice tart rich sour flavor that really does have kind of that apple hint that apple wood that sour kind of granny applewood experience for me and that's that's how it's settling on my tongue really enjoyable eight out of ten for the pipe definitely would uh would recommend smoking it through something like that that's probably one of the best ways i've smoked it so far but now we're going to dive into the joint i'm going to take a couple dry hauls off of this sucker we're going to see how it tastes and what kind of experience we are going to have coming to us but first we do need to bust it up a little bit just to loosen up all the butt on the inside so it flows nice and smooth definitely a kind of sour licorice experience you guys it's exactly what i'm getting it's like the sucker up see you guys we're about three quarters of the way through now a taste from a joint is going to get a 9 out of 10. really really nice experience nice and humid flavor coming off of this joint it really does allow me to sit back smoke my way through it drift off and absolutely love the experience from initial light to where we're at now very very enjoyable bud through a joint i'm loving it now the high the high i'm going to give it an 8 out of a 10. great experience through there it's got a nice strong initial kind of um spark like a little bit of that kind of let's get up and go energy start to transition into a very well very blended body relaxation and ease kind of a high i'm really really enjoying the overall experience that this strain has definitely built up quite a bit through the joint you guys i really started to feel the high through here so i'm thinking that this strain is going to be one that builds up a little bit more it's a little bit more intensity after we end up wrapping up wrapping up recording this review just because if i get a rush right after the bongs i know i'm going to be feeling that high during the review but if it seems to build during the joint that seems to be where we get hit a little bit later after but for now i'm really enjoying this experience with the nine and the eight at the end we go ahead and match up with the bow valley og from last week for a 46 out of 60. now how would i compare them side to side personally i'd go to the bow valley og just because of the strain flavors at the bong level like the the bong that that strain ha that that fino has this one beat by a mile you guys and honestly i really enjoyed it and i uh i think you guys would as well for the price point it's not going to hurt to check out either of these but for the time being we're going to wrap this one up stay tuned tomorrow i'll be diving into some of my cbd one to one gorilla glue that i grew from uh pep seeds and then we've got the weekly wrap up coming sunday you guys and uh i'll let you know exactly what we're diving into all of next week on sunday but for the time being let's wrap this one up cheers you guys and i will see you in the next one oh i just about wrapped this up without giving you guys the info on the end

kosher this is the GMO it's coming to you at a 72 percent on the THC and nothing on the CBD this GMO is garlic cookies if you guys don't know what that is and how you get garlic cookies is you cross skin dog with Girl Scout cookies and that's how you get the garlic cookies I did get this at Manzanilla in Merced and this is a live rosin battered [ __ ] looks amazing it smells just like like garlic like the GMO weed does if you guys haven't tried that I highly suggest finding some GMO and checking it out so this is the live rosin batter some live rosin by Kaui kosher and this is the GMO oh if you guys want to see an up-close look at this before I when I first opened it before I touched it go ahead and check it out [Music] just get a better picture and get a better feel of what it looks like the texture and the consistency I got a big-ass blob there as you can see since it is 710 cheers everybody hope you guys are having a great [ __ ] day hope you guys are dabbing on something great today and let's get it in shall we damn it [ __ ] tastes amazing the flavor on this is so good I like Cali kosher it's a really clean it's really clean brand so far all the extracts I tried from them are all very clean and smooth not harsh grape flavor [Music] if you guys haven't tried to need any strains by Cali kosher I I definitely recommend checking them out oh one more in there one more let's get it all right I'm gonna take it's 2 for the review you know how I do I'm gonna take the second one out of my dizzle puffs I really like this cuz you can put a lot of water in it and hit it and it does not you don't get anything in your mouth so this is a cool ass [ __ ] rig I really like it I got it out of the daily high club daily high club box which I am no longer a part of because I cannot handle waiting the extra month for my [ __ ] product to come in but they do have a cool ass box I just don't feel like waiting an extra month to get it anymore okay cause I wear my hat to for the review you're gonna have to get the second one in on the dizzle puffs I gotta say out of stone eNOS this isn't the the like stoniest [ __ ] extract I've had but it is really [ __ ] clean and and it tastes really good it tastes good it's good I really like it it's just not one of the ones that's gonna put your dick in the dirt you know it is only 72 percent on the THC I've had extracts that are upwards of 90 you know percent on the THC so and if you guys didn't see the video or I eat the bugs go check that out those things don't look like they'd be that bad but almost puke they're not good let's go let's get this heat it up everybody who's not following my Instagram you need to do go do so because I will be doing another raffle giveaway doing a giveaway raffle whatever here in like next week so I'll be announcing at Monday so stay tuned for that there's no cars good a nice and hot now we got a letter sit for me those of you that have not seen a movie recommendation the hateful eight by car directed by Quentin Tarantino if you guys have not seen the hateful eight you guys should watch it it's a [ __ ] dope flick I really like it a lot a good one all Quentin Tarantino films are [ __ ] good go got another nice Dibble on that for us let's put the sunglasses on for the last hit I bought some new ones the by electric I don't know if you guys have ever heard of electric these are the black tops they run you about 130 bucks if you want the polarize they're like 150 or 160 and 3040 bucks extra I like I'm gonna remind me of the old eazy-e glasses I think they're dope I with my sunglasses at night but it's not night time it's only like noon it is noon people on seven 10:17 extracts all right cheers everybody let's get the last dizzle drizzle in oh man that's some [ __ ] poop I'm gonna be sweating over here huh the other day when I got this hat I had them put a smoking a small town on the side of it'll it'd go okay start factoring everything in for this review smoothness it's really good it's not harsh on your throat it's not like [ __ ] me up right now yeah made me cough is that [ __ ] got me baked but my throat's good the taste is is a really clean GMO flavor a real strong GMO flavor I I really like the flavor price I got this a Manzanilla in Merced California and the price was a little steep it's gonna run you like thirty some almost forty bucks for the gram it's kind of pricey but it's really good product hey there's rosin not resin so Highness it's not it doesn't get me like the highest I've ever been off the extract I've been way more baked but like I said I've had [ __ ] upwards of 95 percent or higher so this is only a 72 percent and it hits like a 72 percent am I disappointed no I'm tremendum by am super baked I've just been hired so factoring everything in I am impressed with it even with the overall strain because I do like the flavor I am really baked and it's really smooth it's good stuff I like GMO so I'm gonna have to give it an even 8 I really like it because I like the flavor a lot and I am high so I'm gonna have to give it to even eight for the Cali kosher GMO live rosin bag they even ate it is a very solid strain I highly recommend it all right everybody that was my review until next time smoke in a small town", "CU3NhvUusp4": "hi I'm Steven with Alberta urban garden CA on today's episode we're going to go through different grow light technologies and really showcase what they're all about and then at the end I'm going to make my selection on how I plan to grow this winter there are four classes of bulbs that produce visible light incandescent cfl high pressure sodium in LED for incandescent we're really not going to spend a whole lot of time on them for a couple of reasons they're by far the least efficient of the four options they don't usually produce wavelengths that are appropriate for plant growth we're going to go into CFL high-pressure sodium and LED light technology because they can all achieve great growth results so before we get into the technologies let's quickly chat about what we need so plants produce energy through a process called photosynthesis so where they capture a weight different wavelengths of light can convert that into into organic energy they do that through the use of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b units within their cell now chlorophyll a and B absorb two different light spectra they absorb the red light spectra and the blue light spectrum now you're asking why why don't plants absorb all of the spectra well photosynthesis developed in the ocean what happens to those higher energy spectra as it hits water well it gets absorbed for about a billion years that was the only option available as blue-green algae that's that's where they hang out so what does this mean for your plants well the blue spectra is between 425 and 450 and the red spectra is between 600 and 700 nanometers if you're to just give your plants those those spectra they would not know the difference you could eliminate everything else and your plants will grow absolutely perfectly so now let's talk about the different lighting technologies and at the end I'll let you know which one I've selected to use to grow in my house let's start off with CFL bulbs originally invented in the 8th 90s the technology really took off in the 1970s when mass production began to allow them to become economically viable they consumed 1/3 to 1/5 of the energy of traditional incandescent bulbs and have a lifespan 8 to 15 times longer CFL have an energy efficiency about 7 to 10% in some cases it was reported as high as 15% most CFL bulbs emit a wavelength with spikes in both blue and red light spectrums which combine to make of the white light that you see the further from the plant you have the CFL bulb the less usable energy is hitting the plant hence decreasing their efficiency of benefit most CFL bulbs do not emit significant volumes of heat allowing you to have the plant in close proximity to the bulb to maximize efficiency CFL bulbs are commercially available at big-box stores and are the cheapest on initial investment of the lights we're going to speak about today high pressure sodium lights were invented in the mid-1950s in terms of use for growing vegetables they are more flexible and producing higher volumes of wavelengths the plants can use as high pressure sodium lights have higher energy output you do not need to have your plants as in close of proximity as you do with CFL a special note there are low pressure options however they're not suitable for growth as they only produce low energy yellow wavelengths and not the red and blue that your plants require high pressure sodium do have some characteristics that are typically not ideal for an indoor growing situation typically they emit heat on a level enough to require in most cases specialized venting to prevent overheating of the fixture and the room as you would assume with heat loss and higher energy output of these lights energy efficiency drops in comparison to other grow light systems the cost investment is generally higher than CFL bulbs and typically has a shorter lifespan as well light emitting diodes or LED this is the third category of lights we're going to talk about and they work well for growing plants initially invented in the early 1900's the visible light spectrum and hence wavelengths appropriate for growth were only developed in the 21st century and are fast becoming the light of choice for commercial growers LED lights are by far the most efficient of the three in comparison to CFL with maximum energy efficiency of 10 percent LED can typically achieve 21% efficiency with the recent development of an LED fixture by philips has a reported 67% efficiency the lifespan of LED in comparison to CFL is six to seven times greater and has nearly zero heat produced while running LED do not need to be in close proximity to the plants they are growing as the wavelengths not only are much more targeted to the exact wavelengths plants need but they're much more efficient and do not lose as much as they travel LED unlike CFL and high-pressure sodium are able to emit exact wavelengths of light that target photosynthesis allowing them to specialise in plant growth often you will see lights emitting a purple light which is the combination of both the blue and red spectrums that chlorophyll a and B require for growth although perfect for plants you have to be careful when working around LEDs as a light they are emitting can be beneficial to plants but harmful to your eyes it is recommended to wear protective glasses while the lights are on one drawback for the home gardener is the initial investment required to purchase the lights the initial investment tends to be much more expensive generally in a commercial growing operation the savings in power over alternate technologies usually pays off the initial investment although available in big-box stores for household lighting these LEDs are typically emitting the wrong wavelengths and not quite optimized for plant growth this decreases any gains in efficiency realized by your plants my general rule of thumb to use when researching or purchasing Rolaids is that you want to get the correct wavelengths measured in Kelvin and higher watt bulbs that emit more light for your plants it is important to have the light that emits the wavelengths in the blue and red spectrum the plants use watts are defined by the amount of energy required to operate the lights Kelvin as a unit of measurement describes the spectrum of light being emitted Kelvin ratings of 6500 and 2100 hit the blue and red spectrums respectively this is handy when selecting the right light with the highest wattage possible often I'll mix Kelvin ratings of 6500 and 2100 to ensure I have sufficient light for photosynthesis lumens are not the best indicator when purchasing lights for the purpose of growth lumens are measuring the amount of visible light hitting a square area visible light to humans is only a sliver the spectrum and does not hit the blue and red spectrums plants need I choose to grow with CFL bulbs you can find excellent ones in in hardware stores with the proper wavelengths for growth I mean we just picked these ones up the other data at a big hardware store this also means that you don't need to go to the specialty lighting shop nor order online most places have easy access to hardware stores that will sell things that will will let you grow quite nicely the other thing is the fixtures are quite a bit cheaper I mean this entire setup behind us cost less than 50 dollars and I've been growing with it for a number of years it also allows you with individual light setups to only turn on what you need this optimizes the power consumption and really does make it a lot easier to just use what you need when you need it instead of having a large ballast further to the optimization of power usage because you have smaller watt bulbs and smaller fixtures you're able to consume less power as you're going now yes some these technologies such as LED is quite a bit more efficient per watt but they come in large fixtures and you really can't select in most cases to turn one or two of the little areas off they all turn on or they all turn off with CFL fixtures just unplug one the rest will continue to work the other the addition there is in comparison to high pressure sodium these don't put off a ton of heat so you can have this bulb quite a bit closer to the button it does need for CFL to be close to the plant because you don't have to worry about it radiating Heat what this also means and as you scale up your growing operation you don't need to worry about getting rid of that excess heat in your home because the CFL simply don't produce it you are able to add as many light fixtures as you want to not really need to worry about cooking your plants another added benefit of CFL bulbs is seedlings some of the larger higher energy systems out there they really have a hard time with seedlings because they're producing such a great amount of energy those seedlings really don't need it and sometimes they can actually harm them so one of the drawbacks here now is if you like a good pound and a half tomato that's your favorite tomato and you want to grow that inside CFLs just don't have the the the energy output that can be converted into photosynthetic energy to do that smaller bodied or medium bodied tomatoes and peppers absolutely no problem I've grown them under these lights here not optimized for anything without a problem you do take a little bit less yield overall in comparison to their outdoor counterparts but you can you can still get tomatoes and peppers inside but those big honkin ones you're just not going to be able to accommodate so if you're just looking for some low-energy plants over the winter a little bit of a project or seed starting CFLs are definitely the way to go in my opinion if you want to create your your favorite tomato or your fate or grow some citrus indoors you probably want to go with one of the higher output uh lighting technology so that you can get enough energy to do that over this series of videos we're going to go through the basics of growing indoors

using your press a few hours a week or between 8 to 10 hours per day how much material do you need to press each time this will help determine whether you need to go with a press with more capacity bigger plates or both that being said here are our top picks for the best personal and commercial rosin presses in the market today personal rosin presses rosin bomb rocket why we like it this portable rosin press is the future of personal rosin extraction weighing in at only 13 pounds the rosin bomb rocket can deliver more than 1500 pounds of pressure to its two point eight inch by three point two inch plates with this you can easily press three point five grams in summary the rosin bomb rocket can produce up to 1500 pounds of pressure it comes with two point eight inch by three point two inch plates and can press up to three point five grams at a time while weighing only 13 pounds nug Smasher mini why we like it for those who are not as high-tech and prefer to have a little bit more pressure with their press and are okay with using a little arm grease the nug Smasher mini is a very good comparable option for a personal rosin press featuring 2.5 inch plates and two tons of pressure the Knux masher mini can easily squish 3.5 grams of material with ease in summary that nuke Smasher mini can generate 2 tons of pressure it comes with 2.5 inch by 2.5 inch plates and can easily press up to 3.5 grams of material nug Smasher original why we like it for those needing a little more pressure the Nook Smasher original is the answer it can deliver up to 12 tons of pressure

because it's from January right so I'm worried that this is not going to how right wait here pick it up smack do this one here [Music] [Music] what's it's terrible widows oh my God look at this [Music] three point three fucking bullshit unbelievable piss-poor trim job looks like fucking shit unbelievable look at this look at this fucking shit look at this everybody's fuckin garbage again I just got to test it it's uh September around 12:00 that is from January 14th [Music]", "0WzwQkeY-nE": "hello and welcome to the Migro Youtube\nchannel my name is Shane and I'm the founder of Migro in this video we're\ngoing to look at what are the optimum conditions for your grow room to get the\nbest growth and maximum yield so plants of course need adequate water and\nnutrients to grow healthily but photosynthesis which is the driver of\nthe plant growth it would be largely determined by the amount of light the\nplant receives the amount of co2 the plant receives and also the temperature\nof the environment which will determine the rate that the photosynthesis occurs\nthe data and the references that we're using in this guide are taken from a\nUniversity study published in 2008 by scientist Suman Chandra which are\nlaboratory studies carried out on a high potency strain of cannabis sativa where\nthey looked at the influence of different temperatures light intensity\nlevels in par and co2 levels and the effect on plant growth so let's look at\neach of these in turn so first we look at the level of light intensity that the\nplant is receiving and we're talking about photosynthesis of course we're\ngoing to be talking about light in terms of the horticultural reference which is\npar photosynthetically active radiation and at par levels up to 1500 micro moles\nper meter square per second you can increase growth rates however it's also\nshown that once you get past around seven or eight hundred micro moles per\nmeter square per second the rate of growth that you get is not really worth\nthe amount of extra light energy that you're having to input into the plant so\nit's generally accepted that around seven or eight hundred micro moles per\nmeter square per second is the best trade-off between getting maximum growth\nand not having to use too much energy to get that growth and all the heat and\neverything else that comes with it of course in this is for the flowering\nstage in the vegging stage you would aim to get about 50\nto those levels so somewhere in the region of about 300 350 micromoles per\nmeter square per second you can achieve this by getting your light fixture\nreducing the output from your light fixture using a dimmer if you're using a\nnumber of fixtures by having the number of fixtures you are using or by just\nraising it about one and a half to two times higher than its optimal hanging\nheight and this will reduce the intensity directly underneath the light\nand reduce the light intensity for the vegging stage the optimum temperature\nfor plant growth was tested at two different light levels and sort of a\nmedium of medium and power intensity level of 500 micro moles per second and\nthen a very high level of attires and micro moles per second in both instances\nthe maximum plant growth rate occurred at 30 degrees Celsius and fall off\nfalls off quite significantly where five degrees above or below this temperature\nof course all different strains are going to have have different\nrequirements and needs in terms of temperature our suggestion would be that\na safe band of temperature to operate in would be between 25 and 30 degrees\nCelsius and you should get optimum growth and minimize the risk of\nstressing your plants through to higher temperature finally we look at the\nimpact of different levels of co2 on Plank Road you can see the normal\natmospheric level of co2 is about 370 parts for a million this would be air\nthat you'd be taking into your grow room from the external environment ie fresh\nair if you are replacing that fresh air regularly the general guidance for\ncirculating air range of grow room would be about 60 changes per error and if\nyou're achieving this it's highly likely that you're maintaining that atmospheric\nlevel of co2 in your grow room difficulty with using this system so\ndrawing fresh air in and expelling it out into\nthe atmosphere is it's very hard to increase the co2 level because if you if\nyou input more co2 into the grow area it's only gonna get drawn out just as\nquickly and so it's almost impossible to artificially raise co2 levels there are\na couple of ways of doing it you can enclose the environment so that the air\nrecirculates back into the grow room or is recirculated around the grow room and\nyou use a co2 sensor and some form of adding co2 some technologies such as co2\nbags or burners or co2 tanks and you can use this to artificially elevate the co2\nlevel in your grow room another method you could use is to use effectively\nnatural and free sources so we all expel out co2 when we're breathing and\ntherefore in occupied buildings the co2 level is often raised as much as twice\nthe level of from the external atmosphere that this would be normal and\nso if you can take air into your grow room from an occupied building so a\nhouse or workplace you will most likely be bringing in elevated levels of co2\ninto your grow room which will increase the growth rate so I hope you have got\nsome useful information out of this guide if you have any questions or\nqueries please leave them in the comments

"3BFt7ahUw-8": "what's going on guys VP era here back with another review so another extreme review here they just already see which one it is caught a lien last guys these guys don't need an introduction I mean around a game for quite a long time so in this train review it's a common one one of the most favorite or famous ones is on top of the cab and there's a shirt Accio alright guys this is a hybrid alright guys and let me show you the flower guy so here's the biggest note that they gave me and Wow look at that flower die beautiful beautiful flower it's very sweet alright and he's pretty pungent to see the hair that purple the Keith Wow such a beautiful flower guys so this one this one was hackish on august 2nd so it's pretty new guys it's very fresh you know and this is reading about 21 percent THC what we run them up is 22 and CBD 0% well there's all your other numbers you guys want to see so sure bossy guys honestly the effects on this one was amazing guys as soon as I smoke it was a straight-up uplifting euphoric and just as much change ringing I mean I love smoking this right now because you know as of late my my father-in-law just passed away so you know it's been taking a toll on me mentally and you know I've been getting your depression and stuff like that but you know since I've been using this train to smoke because it kind of puts me in a different mood you know it makes me forget about my my father-in-law in the meantime you know all right Pete and it's the mood changer is that it really brings me up that uplifting euphoric mood you know what I mean that's a great sativa guys I really recommend it for daytime use you know wow very very dense guy really dance so fresh too oh my god about a smoke of mino joint right now guys bad ass joint all right guys there's gonna be a short review on sure bossy Oh like I said you know I'm gonna keep these short reviews these strangers I'm not a smoke it live because I already smoked it I just want to do it afterthought review but yeah guys so here it is hope you guys enjoyed the review on the string of sure Bosco from alien labs alright guys be safe be positive and peace and love", "2TEvjP7oZOY": "hey what's up guys josh here came to bring another review of one of my favorite brands in the entire world we have alien labs um we're gonna be doing a quick review of xeno here um xeno is one of their more recent strains that have come out and it i'm not gonna lie dude this is actually my second eighth of this that i've been trying to hold on to and conserve for about a month i was able to keep it stashed away and then i recently ran out of some stuff and uh kind of went back to it and i'm down to my last nug of it and i figure before i get rid of it i am going to do a review of this because the world needs to know about this um xeno is i wasn't 100 sure what it was um but i need i wanted to try it out and so i tried it out and i can get dude like i'm not even joking i grew up in colorado originally and i've lived back and forth between there in california i live in los angeles now um this is the best suite i have ever smoked in my entire life i can say that without a shadow of a doubt that this is [ __ ] mind-blowing dude how good this stuff is it's next level a little bit of info about it cultivated on june 17 2020 and then packaged on july 9th 2020 and then i ended up buying it a couple days after that pretty much immediately when it came out i bought one eighth and then i tried it and i was just so [ __ ] blown away by it that i went and they were actually sold out and there was a second drop off it and i was able to get some from there i'm hoping that they keep on producing this because this stuff is unmatched but yeah the total thc is a 30.95 percent on it thc a reaches 34.78 which is pretty [ __ ] crazy um i think i've ever had weed that hit over 30 percent um if i did i wasn't aware of it this is the first one that i've seen with high enough numbers or numbers that hit that i know the cryptochronic that they came out with was hitting some of that i think the total thc was or the thc a was over 30 on that one so yeah we're going to open this up i'm going to do a smell and then we'll do a little bit of smoke and i'll talk about it um so yeah right off the bat we're gonna open this thing up yep so you get um like right off the bat like a super fruity cheesiness is what i get from it and it's like one of those things i remember i think it was like pineapple express when he opens it up and he's like smells like god's vagina and weirdly enough that's exactly what i thought when i smelt this dude it was just like so funky and weird but i was just [ __ ] so attracted to it like i had such a deci like the second i smelt it i was like oh my god dude like what the [ __ ] is this then sure enough you go like all across if you try and look it up online what zeno there's no info it's uh all the other alien lab stuff usually tells you what the cross is and then this one didn't um so what i ended up doing is i reached out to ted at alien labs on instagram and i was just like hey dude um i [ __ ] love this strain like i don't know what it is but uh can you give me any info i was like i've been looking everywhere dude and it's like i haven't been able to find anything on this and so what he told me uh was that zeno is a skittles and cushman's cross and once he said that i could definitely smell like the skittles pronounced and he's telling me that uh it's pretty hard to find like a beautiful skittles and they were able to do that with this so shouts out to you guys at alien labs dude because uh you guys keep me very happy dude the way that um i'll smoke some of this and i'll tell you a little bit about what i think about it too after the smoke so down to my last nug of it which is pretty sad i told ted and i was like i feel like this stuff's like like basically like smoking diamonds dude and it's like once it's gone it's just so sad but it's like one of the greatest experiences in the world to do it so uh let's see i'll show you guys the nug and let's see if we can get a good picture there so this is the net last snug there's about two nugs two or three in this one that was that size i don't know if you guys can see that but uh this thing is literally like completely caked inside and out with trichomes dude this is this is beautiful yeah it hurts me to hurts me to smoke it a lot of ways but i mean it's just it's so good so take a little piece off of there put a little bit inside of the me shape pipe um funny story about this pipe i uh got it dirty i got it on hate street um out in san francisco during the first legal 420. um it's a pretty interesting weekend i was out there for a bicycle day event um to visit some old friends that i hadn't seen since i lived out that way and uh ended up getting this for a deal on hate street i forgot what shop it was um yeah right before heading out to the hill on a hippie hill out in golden gate park so yeah first off uh one thing that you'll tell um my fingers are just sticky as [ __ ] dude from back in that bowl um it's just i love it it's like taffy almost like pulling it apart but yeah so here we go got a nice little hit packed in there um i'll let you know what i think as it comes in and out yeah um so it's like a definitely get like that skittles like flavor as it comes out but you also like the thing that really the cryptochronic had a really similar thing to it a lot of gelatos um has like a that umami when you're blowing it out it's like it's almost like just my mouth starts watering dude like i just ate like the most delicious thing in the entire world and like smoke is just so i don't know it's like it massages my throat as like [ __ ] up and weird as that sounds when it's like come when it's like being exhaled and uh i don't know man it's just [ __ ] amazing um also the high it's pretty clear but it's spacey dude but like spacey almost like you're like on the verge of an lsd trip that's how i describe it it's like the alien labs thing it's almost like you're like on the brink from a couple of strains that i've tried it's like you're on the brink of like tapping into a different dimension dude and i don't know if that's like on purpose or why that's i don't know where the name came from or what but that was something i've noticed ever since i started smoking some of these guys and stuff and it's like sometimes when i would do like needlepoint lsd and get that really clear like just like tapped in feeling that's how i feel with this stuff too um but yeah uh the high just it's it's like super out of worldly i'm not getting it as much right now just off that one hit but like i can guarantee by the time i finish this i'll feel like i said it's almost like you're like tapped into something i don't know how to describe it but uh yeah when the first time that i ever smoked this stuff i remember it so clearly um as to why i thought it was so great basically it's like an overall experience kind of thing like the packaging was cool um you know you spend that much money on something and you some people get like the buyer's remorse where they're thinking like oh did i spend too much on this or whatever but then the second that i opened it it was like like holy [ __ ] you know it's like you get that first whiff and like i said the smell was just god's vagina dude is the best way i can describe it but uh yeah then you open it up and you look at the nugs the nugs look absolutely incredible um that helps solidify that like it was a good purchase but then like the first smoke i remember that as i was exhaling i just got like the biggest smile and just like could not stop laughing for like 20 minutes just at like how remarkable the experience was and i told ted this that uh it's almost like the first time i smoked weed i remember that day so vividly in high school and uh i just remember like being on my friend's couch and just like i could not stop laughing dude and it was like i was for like the first couple times that i smoked wheat that's still how it was you know and i feel like everything kind of got mundane where it was just like smoking pot which is smoking pot it was like a lifestyle thing it was just like it's like drinking a cup of coffee you know and some people really appreciate that cup of coffee some people it's just something to get through the day to help them get through the day and that's how we kind of became for me for a little while and ever since i started smoking like the alien lab stuff again or for the first time and then continued to keep doing it again um i've been happy with like every single [ __ ] thing a weed i buy from these guys and anything that was able to give me like that happiness again dude was just i don't know it was just remarkable dude so that's why i really wanted to make like this video uh showcasing the alien lab stuff and i want to do some reviews of their other ones too if you guys are able to find this anywhere the xeno i know they did a live rosin of it also with i think kayla extracts this who that's with um or kawhi i don't know how to say that word actually now that i think about it i'm gonna have to look it up uh but if you find zeno anywhere i think there's gonna be another drop of it or they think there just was another drop of it buy it like i don't know dude i don't have a lot of money like i'm not i'm not rich i don't even have i've been out of work since the quarantine started but this has been one of the things that has made me very happy and i did not regret spending the money on it so yeah xeno also anything by alien labs i'm gonna do i wanted to do ones of the cryptochronic and cosmic crisp which were two other new strains that came out but i ended up smoking them all before i started doing this series", "BShg_6_ZTp4": "what's up y'all it's your boy Shelton for whitening bait I have to talk a little bit louder cause you can hear the rain behind me and as you guys can see behind me it's still dark I was probably about what time is it it is

garlic bud I've never had garlic blood before but we're gonna go to Leafly and see what they got to say about it garlic butter is a classic indica strength from the nineties bred by the seed bank now known as syntheses use an Afghani genetics its name is only loosely tied to garlic bugs aroma I guess I smell that garlic blood um but would you guys know we don't do any of any uh hold on you saw her you guys know we don't do any editing we try to keep the 100% real here so we're gonna go we're going ahead enough get with this garlic but I only have a little bit of it left not just rain thing like he's getting louder and louder leave this garlic bug yes it actually smells like garlic let's break it open and see look like go see the crystals in there alright let's stop playing let's go ahead and get it in well this rain is kind of cozy though for real tell you the two I kinda like it you know what I mean you know you had nothing to do what I'm saying anyway I'm just being silly oh yes I am every time every morning I wake up I'm just wide open every morning so we're gonna break this up real quick and get it in my handy-dandy trust a bomb it's local hunt for y'all let y'all know we think about it I try to look up the name of the blood but I know it's garlic oh geez what Kimberly find garlic Ojibwe me like lemon garlic or um or garlic punch but this isn't lemon garlic this is garlic bud learn your chemistry y'all live it out on Padilla learn your chin the street anyway let's go ahead and get it in y'all y'all see it in the ball let's get down Wow okay I wasn't expecting that y'all know usually on the first hit I take little here so that doesn't happen I'm sure y'all wanna see me sit up here and talk for like a half hour and that's all be strong whoo whoo we young great day in the morning that stuff was really potent Wow yeah y'all see ahead let me get my free real quick Wow wow that was more drastic down thought that was a serious hit song anyway if you have a problem with with smoking life if you have a problem with smoking if you have a lung problem or something or you can't breathe properly always remember take smaller hit it hurts nothing to take smaller hits and you get to enjoy your heart easy there's no way to enjoy your bug if you're coughing as hard as hours of coffee because now start to get a slight you know when you talk too much you get a slight headache and coffee it's not a headache that slow me down take away from my energy cuz my energy is always perfect well mom always up and ready to go but oh just take smaller hits like [ __ ] a small it's then you can enjoy your you can enjoy your but a lot better see there's no choking the expense rate on this is drastic y'all see the two-bit my lungs like whoo so yes garlic put two thumbs up that [ __ ] is on point for real I got a little buzz going already off the X lag on my live cuz I'm trying to hold back this you know me you called so much it's like you don't throw up we had this conversation before but oh wow garlic go G nice buns it's really quite tasted it it actually tastes lemony tell you - I don't know if I just put that on my hair because I was reading that that garlic OG garlic blood and lemon lemon garlic is all the same but it actually does taste kind of lemony now I'm going to think about it it's not piney if this women is it does it taste just like lemon but it's really nice as a it's like a sweet women eat a sweet Lebanese fine it's kind of hard to explain I have to go back in and check it out for y'all one more time yep there's a limited party it's quite tasty the flavors complement each other the lemon complements the wine the fine complements the budge it's just wow that is really quite tasty gosh and I'm sure although I didn't get this from the dispensary I'm sure that this is essentially grade you can always tell the difference between regular blood like Street bug and dispensary grade normally I have Street bugs because Florida dispensary is oh no way is really weak there's no taste to it have you ever smoked bug has no taste absolutely no taste I've never had a bug that's what leads me to believe that that Florida's weed is genetically created it's gotta be man because there's absolutely no flavor to it you break it over there's no smell it looked like but if I didn't have my if I couldn't smell then I would be like oh this there's some good ass but cause you open it up and it looks really nice but Florida got some weak-ass genetically created bugs all I'm gonna tell you right now I've never had weed that has no flavor for I've never had anything that has no flavor to it there's absolutely no flavor to Florida cannabis and I've gotten it from many dispensaries so I have to outsource say to the street but this is dispensary great I can tell and it's really quite nice I'm feeling quite philosophical right about Mannie underneath that is really flavorful anyway you guys I hope you guys enjoy your date hope you guys slept really well um why don't you show one random one random act of kindness today and if you keep doing that pretty soon you'll you'll be used to being kind to people so talk be nice to your neighbors be nice to people uh keep your hand up stay positive and you guys know what I'm gonna say always stay bait bye [Music]"}
