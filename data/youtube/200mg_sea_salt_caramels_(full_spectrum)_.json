{"k8WwxoTnoUI": "We're Adam and Joanne from inspiredtaste.net and welcome to our kitchen.  We're making our soft salted caramels recipe.  These salted caramels are soft, chewy and perfectly melt away in your mouth.  Before making our salted caramels... we always make sure we have our equipment ready... and all ingredients measured out. Here's a loaf pan, we are going to lightly oil it... then we're going to cut a piece of parchment paper, lightly oil that... then insert that inside the loaf pan... which makes our lives a lot easier for when we want to unmold the caramels when we're done. Next for the ingredients, we need to measure a half cup of... heavy whipping cream... then grab one stick of butter, which is also a half cup... and cut that into eight... equally sized pieces.  Add that to a bowl... then add the cream... and place it into the microwave... then cook for about a minute... until the butter has melted and the cream is hot... set that aside... then measure out a quarter cup of light corn syrup... and one cup of granulated white sugar... now grab a small saucepan... add three tablespoons of water to the saucepan... grab the corn syrup that you just\nmeasured out and add that to the saucepan. Next for the sugar... add it but try your best not to splatter the sugar up the sides of the pan.  Then use a spoon... or spatula... to stir the sugar... into the water and corn syrup.  Heat to medium and bring to boil. Now once it as a boil you might to make sure there aren't any sugar crystals on the sides of the pan...  since this can cause something called crystallization... which can make your caramels grainy and really ruin the texture... to help with this... cover with a lid for about one minute. Remove the lid and attach a candy thermometer... you will want to cook the sugar until it reaches 320 degrees F.  At this temperature the sugar will take on a light amber color... now we are ready to add the butter and cream mixture from before... add it in small batches... then use the candy thermometer... to stir it into the sugar mixture.  As you do this... the caramel will bubble violently... so you really want to do this slowly and carefully... so nothing bubbles over. Place the candy thermometer back onto the side of the pan... and cook the caramel... until 240 degrees F... this will create a soft caramel... if you want harder caramels... cook to 245 degrees F.  Now pour the caramel... into your prepared loaf pan... and let it sit for about fifteen to twenty minutes... while you wait it's best to clean your\npot and candy thermometer... fill the pot with water, place the candy thermometer into the water... and bring the water to a boil... this will melt away all the caramel... and make clean up really easy. After about twenty minutes you can salt the top of the salted caramels... then let it sit... for three to four hours... until firmed up.  Then your done... unmold the caramel... and cut into whatever shape and size you like. Enjoy!", "voQMPKZ7EdA": "oh hi let's talk car mouse the candy kind the chewy melt-in-your-mouth deeply sweet and insanely addictive kind these make some of the best gifts ever since making caramel requires your undivided attention once you begin you should never walk away prepare all your tools and equipment in advance including a cake pan lined with oiled parchment and tools you will need for the ingredients get the best salted butter you can find like Irish butter cut into cubes and add fleur de sel next scrape vanilla bean then heat up heavy cream with vanilla seeds and the pod cover and let them infuse to make caramel you have two options one with sugar and water and the second one with sugar only which is called Camela sake with this method you can't go wrong cook one third or half of the sugar first when it begins to melt stir with a spatula or whisk every so often until it turns into amber color on medium-high heat repeat this step with remaining sugar and continue cooking until the caramel turns into deep amber color and shows no more lumps reduce the heat the candy thermometer should read now 345 degrees Fahrenheit 175 degrees Celsius and begin to smoke but you don't want to wait too much longer now turn off burner and prove in your heart heavy cream turn heat back on and cook mixture until thermometer reads 250 degrees Fahrenheit 120 Celsius then turn off the heat and add butter and flow the cell it looks and it smells incredible keep in mind that if your sugar is cooked right to begin with you will get many complex compounds that contribute to a richer flavor pour the caramel out into the oiled parchment-lined pan allow it to sit undisturbed for at least 2 hours overnight is best look that is exactly what you are cut caramel block into candies using a very sharp knife this recipe by the way yields 64 bonbon about 10 grams each I met squares but if you want to cut them into rectangles that is totally up to you for the look and to be served on a platter you can sprinkle some Felder cell on top otherwise wrap each caramel in wax paper without salt I hope guys you have enjoyed this salted caramel episode to get the full recipe go to Bruno's

moving just from square to a rhombus just take the perfect one careful names there's no going back whoa careful whoa max whoa geez close huh whoo yeah was that close one that's your process well you know only when people are watching yeah it's pretty tough thing you know yeah that's where it's a tough life there's the the rejects yeah okay yeah I don't think everybody and the youtubes knows all the nicknames I was gonna say this codebase you guys talked about serial father special agent Karen buzz like she could just be special okay well we can't get too close to the Wi-Fi here guys they over here didn't I forgot to turn the Wi-Fi off God you go first you know I could go still turn it off you could I could look at let me do it look how crackly it's gonna get and then it's all sudden off no more crackles no three zone my mom will you what's your method was your method your madness or my method is different from your Papa's and I am going this you do the shakin I did the shakin shakin no bacon shake no big head mom you just watched tail digging nice for the first time did I didn't ya you sure did what do you think if I was a fortune your boy who liked a lot better it was Pharaoh welfare little Ferrell well barrel actually my favorite thing that will Pharaoh ever did was funny or Die the website oh yeah parole the landlord that was hilarious I shouldn't be making your toddler say bad words I would never did they hit her stop after she was like 4 years old or something like that because it didn't monitor I don't think she knew the words that she was saying she just was saying them your father slipped once when leah was about ten months maybe a year old one time he slipped and she just went around repeating that for days hmm yeah I don't know and I mean he recovered and went on to something else up she knew that that was something that she shouldn't be doing it cheap she did it so anyhow that's all I have to say about that so anyways yeah I just try to make sure each little these little corners little corner and crevice is covered and then we'll sprinkle some salt on there just to make sure you get your sodium intake in America there's so many people that are deficient yeah I'm just trying to help things yeah fish like a vitamin so instead of tossing in your hand you just talked into the pile of chocolate that's how I do it yeah it's probably wrong yeah but we'll keep hearing yeah my price is right now I do have a question for the YouTube family at this time of the year when we run out of winter green patties which we have done they're not on the website right now I usually just don't make him again so this one guy comes in here calls me in the summer and orders like 150 of them mm-hmm so right now there's no way or green patties on the website but if you folks because they have been ordering quite a lot of them so if you folks want them cuz you know winter is over that's why we don't have winter green patty you know some green patties wanna let us know and we'll make them cuz we just made peppermint patties because those sell year-round in a big way but winter green patties we've always traditionally when we run out after Easter we just let them run out until that guy orders them in the summer yeah so let me know that you know and then if I'm here I can make a video about it did you do what about peppermint patties no okay because it's you say much different hey people it's doing so much different than that they want I think they won't see every time we do that because people love the starch room and it's always different dad's always got some different dad jokes mom's always got some more sarcasm and and Max is uh always gonna have his hair max is always gonna have his hair and until one day when he decides to cut it yeah yeah just wearing a ponytail on in my hat so why bother yeah what are you gonna what's it gonna look like give me a ball you're gonna get a buzz cut not this time you look good buzz come on you can do it see what happens you know I'll surprise you you know what don't even get a buzz cut you just got shiny and all the way I don't know I'm not sure how the shape of my head is that's good enough well like I said you ran ahead all the time you're right let me meditate on that okay go ahead you have a method for your salt salt putting on yeah how do you how do you sprinkle it mom a pinch oh look at it don't miss it if you do it's okay yeah cuz you'll do it again we've got a lot yeah there's more where that came from you gotta make sure I think last time might have been out of focus and make sure it's in focus oh well then yeah get that action-packed video mmm wow that was worth it I'm almost out of breath I know I am on a strenuous is these caramels are so heavy mm-hmm so heavy not as heavy as ease though huh you got the hard job today cherries these are cherries cherry this is what cherries look like max did you know that yeah these are broad sharing cream flavored mm-hmm cherry cream flavored cherry no job not facing the chocolate today these are cherry trees cherry flavored creams green cream flavored cherries max what are we gonna do with them yeah you guys got another another couple here's a dia then we should start looking at nursing homes can I get a good deal you know you can just get a nice pasture put us out there there's probably you might find something Groupon yeah yeah we're build with those tiny homes yeah yeah I'll just lock you guys in there yeah with some rice in a pan yeah I'll keep all the change in that the coin jar yeah well you're not gonna need it when in a tiny home like I said I'll just lock you in there with some rice in a pan beans and beans I don't know if you want to be in a tiny home with a bunch of B until gotta heat it up somehow nice apron bro yeah jealous yeah Karen - lets see that apron lookin fancy here you're a woman of many words Karen we only really have the fanciest people working here the criteria yeah I mean like when I put an ad wherever I put an ad for hiring people mm-hmm pretty infrequent cuz the last time time before last I had an ad out it would have been probably in a newspaper and all the most recent time was Craigslist mm-hmm that's where we got other much higher we should I don't Terry the other Terry hasn't been in very many videos and people spell when I talk to you about you a lot of times I write T erri when your name is that she's about te rry but the other Terry's name is spelled T erri so they're actually referring to a different Terry when they misspelled your name so if you get confused I can just be Terry mom Terry mom did something somebody wrote Terry and they're like wait we have a Terry are you talking about because there's not often gonna be writing my name I don't think okay Wow sometime we'll have to get somebody putting it in the box because that's just riveting oh yeah it was action-packed actually I could even do that I record it I've never done anything on camera well if I could do something as crazy as putting caramels into cups and in boxes and once I have multiple times it's even on video camera demo there's stuff too but most the time I don't videotape myself doing so felids because I only have so many hands and also I rarely do it in that camera I would be tough to wear on your head yeah it's so heavy yeah not exactly a GoPro you have a certificate in box folding if you don't have that it's not gonna work out have you run into ever any problems with box folding Craig yeah the boxes yeah I got a really frustrated neighbor - your best friend dad just started doing him because I kept ripping box after box after box and I was it go okay well I'm just wasting boxes right now I showed actually I show Terry how did you boxes the other day mm-hmm and like the small ones with these ones I said oh yeah go someday you're just gonna be able to come together now do you look at the same time she's like I don't know about that yeah yeah it's a superpower I can reset the alphabet with my eyes closed backwards no oh I mean I can turn around backwards and have your back to me do that okay wave my eyes closed I don't think you can I can yeah I can fit into the earrings I wore in high school fine yeah no way Karen do you want to wow us with anything what have you got can you still fit in the same areas you wore in high school wow that's impressive people working here yes and the best sauce somebody was saying when somebody likes Karen soothing voice when she was rapping and then she said we're just curling ribbon she's like you wanna put real tight like you're choking somebody who's soothing now it's true you have to get that point across when you curling ribbon it's gotta be nice and tight keep the air out but today we're lucky we've got the windows open right that sweet spot where you don't have to have a heat on more air conditioning you hear the birds are tweeting and whatnot mm-hmm well how much is the four-piece note for the nine piece because people always ask and I always get the wrong answer $15.99 is that the same for the truck covered cherries for the same price okay I have to do after this is William and the Terr which is the weight of the box and that one is 0.75 so make sure you have an orange scale I feel like some people seriously they might use other colored scales it won't be quite accurate it's not gonna spend the extra money to make an orange scale and if you don't you can just paint it I think if I work just bring an orange scale over on the boat with yeah or maybe markers no I know you're trying to think outside of the box but I found this is kind of like DIYs orange scales at home not everybody can afford an orange scale I feel sorry for those feet so you know we gotta think of alternatives no how about how are you really gonna run a legit candy business I tell you guys start somewhere okay and you want to finish this off with a gold loop who saw that coming I did me to approximate viewers because that's what we always do the practice yes you want to keep them on there and it looks purty yeah it keeps them in place makes him look as mom said party party party in the tear on this one is 1.25 2705 that's all I have to say about that [Music]", "IcFVxh2_HaU": "I like chocolate as much as the next person but when it comes to my sweet tooth I'm a sucker for caramel now I used to be satisfied with any caramel that came my way but I have to admit I've become a little bit of a caramel snob and cellophane wrapped candies that have the texture of sugar flavored plastic just don't do it for me anymore I'd rather invest a little time and a few kitchen staples to make salted caramels my own the thing to remember about working with caramel is that you can never turn your back on it you can stand and watch sugar steer a bubble for what seems like hours without even the slightest color change but if you walk away to answer the phone your caramel will burn before you have the cell to your ear it knows trust me on this start by cutting one vanilla bean in half lengthwise and use the tip of a paring knife to scrape out the seeds you'll need to infuse one cup of heavy cream and five tablespoons of unsalted butter with the vanilla bean seeds and a teaspoon of salt this mixture adds richness and flavor to the caramel but it also helps keep the caramel soft and chewy bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat and then turn off the burner and let the flavors meld for at least 10 minutes if you feel like taking care of some chores or washing your hair before you start your caramel that's no problem just let the cream mixture steep a while longer the longer it sits the more vanilla flavor it'll develop since caramel is sticky by Nature it's a good idea to use a pan lined with parchment I'm using an 8 inch square baking pan I also spray the parchment with vegetable oil spray for added insurance so it doesn't get sticky I suggest that you prepare the pan ahead of time because you're sure won't have time to prepare it when you're holding a pan full of foaming hot caramel I also recommend you use a large high-sided saucepan to make the caramel you might think a smaller vessel would work but the caramel is going to foam up when you add the cream mixture and you really don't want a sweet version of Mount Vesuvius erupting all over your stovetop combine 1/4 cup of light corn syrup 1/4 cup of water and 1 and 1/3 cups of sugar in the saucepan since one of the dangers in making caramel is crystallization I like to pour the sugar into the middle of the pan to prevent any granules from getting stuck on the pan sides now heat the mixture up over medium-high heat until the sugar dissolves but don't stir it do this until the syrup has a faint golden color and registers 300 degrees this will take about seven to nine minutes then lower the heat to medium-low and gently swirl the pan periodically as you continue to cook the mixture for another two to three minutes the lower heat here will give you more control and help guard against burning wait for the color to change to Amber and then when the mixture reaches 350 degrees it's done you can also watch the bubbles early on they're very separate and boil vigorously but over time they'll become smaller and more delicate almost foamy carefully remove your saucepan full of very hot caramel from the heat carefully stir in the cream mixture watch it foam and then breathe a sigh of relief that you listened to me and went with the high-sided saucepan now return the pan to the heat and cook the caramel until it reaches 248 degrees now that the cream has been added it's not only safe but it's also imperative to stir the caramel so that it doesn't burn this step should only take about five minutes so you really won't be stirring for very long remember the temperature of that caramel when you're tempted to stick your finger in to taste this gorgeous looking mixture you just made also keep it in mind when you're pouring the caramel into the prepared pan because take it from me caramel burns are no fun once it's in the pan smooth the surface of the caramel and let it cool for ten minutes then add the best part flaky fleur de sel half a teaspoon sprinkled on the surface really gives great flavor and crunch to the caramels and if you're slightly more daring and of course you are then I suggest you try substituting smoked sea salt now comes the hard part waiting for the caramels to cool and set to make sure the caramels cut into nice clean squares let the pan cool to room temperature for an hour and and pop it in the fridge for another hour when it's finally cool lift the sling to remove the caramel square from the pan and then peel the parchment away use a sharp knife to cut the caramel into three quarter inch squares pretty much the perfect size since the caramels tend to stick together it's really best to wrap them individually in pieces of waxed paper but keep in mind that the caramels will get pretty soft if you leave them at room temperature so it's really best to store them in the refrigerator and that's it homemade salted caramels you can find this recipe and over 100 other recipes in the America's Test Kitchen DIY cookbook there's everything in here from how to make sour dill pickles to bacon jam to making your own root beer and a really cool stuff so if you're interested please check it out", "1bHeHNscJAI": "my recipe for sea salt caramels is creamy and the caramels have just the right amount of chew so I'm going to start these caramels with a cup and a half of sugar I'll put that in my pots for a little richness in color in flavor I add a quarter cup of dark brown sugar I pack that into my measuring cup to get the right consistency in a caramel it takes a combination of ingredients a combination of sugars but also of cream a cup of evaporated milk and I'll pour that into my pot and I'll add to that half a cup of whipping cream and for a bit of flavor I'm going to add the scraped seeds of half a vanilla bean if you want to use vanilla extract in place of the vanilla bean that you would add at the very end right when you take your caramel off the heat but because I'm adding the seeds I want to work that vanilla flavor in and it takes the heat to really extract the flavor from the seeds I have a square 8-inch pan that I've greased and lined with parchment paper so just like the lollipops the tools aren't complicated I've got my thermometer on hand to measure the temperature the entire time I cook the caramel mixture it'll be on high heat and because I've added the evaporated milk in the cream you constantly want to be stirring it and this will bubble up and steam a fair bit so just keep that in mind you want to pick a long-handled whisk and a long-handled spoon or spatula all right oh this is the point when your mixture really bubbles up it's come to a full boil so now is the time to add my corn syrup and switch to a spatula this is two thirds of a cup of white corn syrup and I don't add it with the initial sugar because then it would actually cook too far and you'd end up with a caramel that sticks in your teeth this will only take a second to return to a full boil and when you see those bubbles it may be tempting to turn down the heat but you want to keep on high but you'll constantly stir just to make sure that caramel is not sticking at the bottom the temperature I'm looking for as I Durer and the mixture bubbles away is 242 so that's also known as the softball stage well and you think of the texture of a creamy caramel it is kind of soft and then it melts away into nothingness I love that transformation of sugar to caramel as you cook it and it can take about eight minutes the smell changes the way it's bubbling changes and then you'll see towards the end the color changes there we are 242 I'll take this off the heat and I'll add my 1 tablespoon of butter and when you're making candy if the recipe calls for salt it's always added at the very end because that little addition of salt can actually impact the texture of your caramel and prevent it from being really really creamy and smooth there we go now that it's stopped boiling I can pour it into my prepared pan it looks like caramel sauce just now but it will set up because we know we hit that soft ball stage of 242 in my final Edition before it sets up is a nice even sprinkling of flaked sea salt right on top the sea salt that you sprinkle on top won't dissolve into the caramel and it adds such a satisfying crunch but it also serves to balance the sweetness of the caramel itself you want to give your caramel a long time to set it may look like it's set but I find it takes at least four hours so I set it aside on the counter to cool completely and when it's time to slice it I actually pop it in the fridge for about 90 minutes for it to cool down a little bit you don't want to store caramels in the refrigerator the sugar will actually melt and you'll end up with just a puddle of caramel so it doesn't look any different after spending just 90 minutes in the fridge and then you get that sense of creaminess go a little sauce away your parchment and then slice away really get a sense of that consistency the caramels hold together but they are still soft and pliable you want to store your caramels at room temperature and I like to store them in a single layer if they have other caramels stacked on top of each other well they will eventually flatten because part of a delicious caramel is that they are just that right amount of soft", "3PTp8NNccbw": "today given that are going to be trying the dark chocolate sea salt thermals these are from Whole Foods these were given to me free of charge they originally had been $8 to 81 cents but I got to a conversation with someone there named Lindsay she said she did the ordering right marketing market and anyway we got to talking and she she told her I did reviews and she told me that these were like her favorite things sweet thing in the store so she wanted me to trump so these were free they are delicious dark chocolate covered caramel sprinkled with sea salt they don't have a calorie column at all of course they're just distribute distribute about Whole Foods I said there were eight dollars and 81 cents so yeah they're not cheap at all for the container and I can hold one up for you so that you can see you can clearly see the salt on these in cuido mr. peg is not allowed to have any it's a salt they're good I think I would like them to milk chocolate better they don't have that typical bitter taste documentation don't talk about I like milk total better tune but boy I got that a piece of salt air at the am that was delicious Detroit it goes good with that was very good because you taste the the chocolate you really taste that caramel and then you swallow it and just when you think it's over you get that more salt the burst of salt and it's really really good I like that a lot I don't know honestly that I would spend almost nine dollars for this though I mean that's that's all when you just pay I don't think it'd get tell us how many you get it's a it's a weight it it is for not even a pound yeah point seven three five pounds so it they are very good but a little bit too expensive for for me because I there's so many others that I can buy for half of that price but they're very very good and so I'm glad I got to try because it's not something that I would have generally picked out so thanks for watching", "Fdw-cA3pBnI": "hey guys look that I'm Christopher pang and you're watching kitchen in on today's episode we are going to be making bourbon sea salt caramels from scratch what a great way to start off your holiday season in some alcoholic candy why not here are a few ingredients that you'll need for this recipe sugar butter bourbon light corn syrup kosher salt flaked sea salt sweetened condensed milk on medium low heat we're gonna add our sugar our light corn syrup and our water we want to bring all this up to a boil and stirring occasionally until all the sugar dissolves while our solution comes to a boil we're gonna cut our cold butter into small cubes and then we're gonna add it into that caramel to stop it from getting a darker color and achieve the deep amber that we want so this is a deep amber color we want so what we want to do now is to take the pot off the stove to slow down the cooking process and by adding our sweetened condensed milk and cold butter that will also assist in stopping and halting the process and all you want to do is so now we want to let it reach 240 degrees on medium-low heat which is also known as a softball stage and it looks like we are now at our softball stage so now we can turn off our heat take that pot off you want to grab a lined baking sheet with parchment paper if you don't have that you can use what I'm doing is a silicon brownie pan and you want to take that hot sugar and please be careful yes I did say it is hot at 240 degrees you don't want to burn yourself you want to just pour that out into the pan or your mat until it's nice and even and just kind of let it cool down it's just slightly before touching okay so finishing all this off I've got some amazing flakes sea salt just sprinkle away and now is the part that's going to socket we've got to wait for these little babies to cool down before I can cut into them wrap them up in my bed so we'll come back in a little bit let these cool down for a few hours and then Oh Oh the only tricky part about Cairo there's a cleanup all right so the camel is going to have to pick it up and cannot work with it so I'm going to cut them up into little bite-sized pieces to wrap them individually and put them into an airtight container you can kind of store these for about two weeks is that a whole bunch pretty sure they're not going to last few days so we are gonna want to flip these out of the mold onto our cutting board I'll just be very careful the caramel is kind of soft and flimsy so we'll just knock them out and flip it back around just make life a little bit easier on ourselves and it smells amazing guys so what we want to do is just cut these into even pieces so I'll start mine in half and I'll just work with one piece at a time all you want to do is grab a piece of parchment or wax paper placing your caramel in the center rolling it up almost like a little gift and feeling it from both sides and there you have it our bourbon sea salt caramels alright now that all my channels are sealed in an airtight container I can keep these up to two weeks like I said before hopefully

the wheel dialogue but we threw what's it on now they maganda fear less than 90 secrets out or back there 87 here so is it usually cooler when it comes out yep okay that makes sense she's so fast why you got a machine she is a machine this machine will go slightly better look at her goal and so these ones you said are not quite normal caramel sides and that quite sea salt caramel sighs yeah what if they don't we'll be okay okay so she says anyway gonna be zero Kelvin looks like you just in the blower just right to I mean I definitely bumped into it oh yeah no that's what I put the figure out and it was like I moved it a little bit when I put the thing on so I just kind of pumped it back yeah it's good think about that is that the speed of the wheel yeah turn it down just a hair yeah is that just bringing up too much chocolate all at once it's yeah like it got a little fog up the corners earlier is here maybe six it's going down still won't you hit it again make it go off me I've gone up to remember I told you many times still liquid in the back so so from cutting the caramel to finishing through the in Rober and sea salt in it does it take like 45 minutes to an hour I don't know how it's taken an extra couple minutes so an hour maybe a little bit less and if mom was to cut it and you're to cover it by hand probably like she takes me a little almost an hour and 20 minutes hour and a half for furlough okay so it probably almost the same amount of time we should count up how many of these ones we got I know this isn't exactly the right size but at least we'll have like a close yeah yeah I can't wait until we do the oh that was a loaf and a half in the pan right but you did the math the other day right for how many caramels should come in a loaf yeah for the smaller ones it should be like 132 okay so you know talk to my successor elope yes lucky that sighs yeah so for sea-salt do you know how big how much would be pretty salt okay but I mean that would that would be easier to find the customer the measurements on the sea salt are I was going to say that they're all over an inch but it's point seven-five okay and how did you figure out the the math for at least the smaller ones I made a function relative to the ax yeah x and y is variables and I made it relative to the X so then I can make each fraction a whole number okay and then just divided it by the same and how'd you come up with that idea just thought about longer when yeah I tried to think about it without the numbers you know it's like how do you you don't I mean if you made like if you made the point five one and you made the point seven five one and a half it's the same thing yeah it's the same ratio yeah yeah I wouldn't a thunk of that exam ember yesterday you're like how do you every time you multiply like a decimal just get smaller instead of giving you actual size well this isn't gonna work yeah it's gonna watch that you like the actual yeah oh me too mm-hmm I avoid it at all costs because I have a phone dude did you know that if you turn your phone sideways it's a scientific calculator yeah it is actually that's really cool I usually don't need that though cuz I'm usually just like let's add this up just to make sure I'm not making a mistake because I know I will yeah if you have to like do anything with numbers like that I have more than six digits yeah yeah oh yeah yeah so you can actually see them all and stuff yeah ya know so that's all that comes in one loaf [Music]", "5nUsYC9FLzo": "what up what's up guys it's Bishop here with Sanders where did you get this Costco now these are dark chocolate sea salt caramels or caramels and these look Van Tassel are you kidding me how great - those look amazing now this was established in 1875 how many years you're gonna miss me years carry the one I you know what we're here right now and they're still in existence which means they've had customers they know how to retain customers and they know how to get a new customer that means so that means that this must be pretty good it says not all caramel is created equal I'm not sure what that means made will kettle cooked caramel so maybe this caramel is created Brady so we got the top off not as hard as Mike said it was gonna be this one's looks like you can even see the CC let's Cheers this thing that's what makes a fully cow how good the sea salt at taste oh my god on your palate the sea salt with the sweetness of the chocolate like if these were just dark chocolate caramel it'd be like okay that's fine you can get there here there and everywhere ah how much was this $8.99 or some 849 Wow what to get this much oh I'm saying how big it is that's it that's it this is huge this is big compared to right you're gonna have a party and there's but there's still like a big party like I think what Mike's trying to conserve a lot of people this can serve a long yes you can wait look at all that there's like there's some light that's a lot of sea salt it's not just like one or two flakes and this is unreal when you can taste the sea salt on your palate that blows my mind when you first put it in there and then what you're true in the car it's like over here up here down here it's what I love it I love it too wow it's like a hidden gem that no one knows about with you and me this would bless couple days but anyway highly recommend a bullet phenomenal thank you for introducing me to this forehead to forehead love you love you yep when you get to the end of it you're chewing your like mantle and then you still taste these little few things of Cecil", "KbK74JtDzqA": "so Max is about to do this without having his trusty salt with them this your first time and the in Rober there max yeah that's it this is probably our first time ever in roving caramel on video huh yeah probably except for the other six or seven times but this times different yeah this is this is this is more gooder this was in May so I don't think the other ones were shot in May so you know this may be different I got a tray we have another kamikaze this wars in the requisition oh yeah I don't think last maybe last time there wasn't a blower on there so would be a completely different experience he's cleaning the wheels yeah just in case and waiting for the temperature to go down no coverage right now he'll just clean the wheels and then once max is done - max is the bottleneck but slow down this little operation holiday why stop now yeah I also at least forget that I'm in control of like starting it so like yeah yeah you guys are both like come on talk to me being on that side is a bad idea so pretty can you say this is the hardest part right here max Oh devil so I didn't know when I don't want to come on take off all so you just kind of eyeball it yeah this kind of they didn't think that that deal and stuff tiny bit iron like once you kind of get like that bumps we got bumps and these ones with he so it'll get bumps from having too much chocolate too little chocolate I'm not sure if it's like a surface tension that's unscientific let's go that I really don't understand it you could almost see it's like undulates you know the top years it's like it's like it's blowing in veins but that's like one continuous opening on the bottom of the blowers but that's how you know it what are you looking for now making sure the blowers yeah Oh hurry up oh geez the thing is I know now dad's got the hard part just stand-in there beside me now yeah yeah if you mess up the boss is gonna come after you you need like a sweat rag or anything we've got to have a mirror here and yell at himself till you put myself yeah what didn't say sweating bullets but he was sweating salt but caramel I guess we even L garbled you sweat caramel yeah probably would sound like a weird rare condition I don't even like that maple Sierra probably the caramel look like they're already coming that's a good time that's how we used to do or know that we like really have be really a tempered when I was drying yeah the work kids anytime kiddo how many loaves you guys gonna do today - old - loves coming no I cut three yells at you there huh he gets the other side that's only fair No No you know you don't joke around max - yeah it's no joking around making candy yeah it's no joke no that's what we fun so close that one we were like doing student decorations or something that's like that's not right it's supposed to be this color or something like that I'll avoid oh really with the creams yeah yeah I have many heart attacks before I really would be able to sell any of those if there's a wrong decoration all the customers they know all the decorations okay what are these loops doing on these these ones that need dots there no I mixed up like the buttercream in this drug like the half-covered versus the dots the cow creams versus like just getting a dot I'm not sure if it's the butter you know it's a buttercream that the butterscotch get the white dude the strawberry gets around I did them opposite wait Wow now that's now that's the slide he'll match slide the workers upstairs you know they know the decoration and they go to put a strawberry in it's really raspberry that'd be the end of the world don't they similar now somebody will come back real mad yeah Wow we go out of business that way you gotta shake your flashlight battery did you check make sure the bottoms are getting all covered the trick flashlight trick Oh dead hurry you space these out like six inches or so your book they're far about that you know for people at home trying to do this just do it this far okay who's your hand everybody's got the same shape and and his eyes and stuff I looked it's pretty cool when it goes under that curtain to chocolate - favorite part pretty cool yeah it's pretty cool and how long do you think it would take you to do two loaves of caramel chocolate bag just truck coming up by hand takes a little over an hour per loaf you know by hand yeah yeah I'll take you guys what like half an hour to do all two of them yeah all two of them probably my sound at 12:30 is cold 35 been about ten and a half minutes that's been five minutes it's yeah it's all I meant all the time - five minutes yeah yeah so you just look for speckles and wait just like not being super shiny yeah they look nice and shiny I don't want to call it a pattern it's not a pattern like it if your chocolates gonna bloom you'll start to see patterns in the chocolate as it's dry okay like a lineup when it's over there loosen it when it's like this wet and then especially when it's here you would know if that was going to bloom at that home yeah I mean cuz it'll all have speckles or it'll look I don't I don't even not to say did you just notice some off colored things it's not a color so much is like there's a texture to the chocolate yeah like it should just be a smooth sheen yeah he's a good spacing it worked although I probably wouldn't have happened if he didn't have get it right in quite a little gay chicken or the egg food yeah thinking like that looks yeah yeah magic amount the magic amount of salt yeah okay

if you don't it's still useful you should teach that in schools what does what does mean and how's that difference then can you can you conjugate that there's well no because you can't conjugate it kids it's in the moment I think there's only a present tensed yeah I don't know I just know that conjugate it just sounds like a foreign language thing I'm just throwing it around like a buzz word you know I'm kind just making like a word salad over here you monster she was talking about basketball she is some buzz words oh yeah buzz words are very important for word salads they're kind of like the hallmark of words it's kind of like the romaine of a workaround you could say that what would the dressing mortality words that you don't understand big birds okay okay yeah big words but real buzzwords yeah you know so I like the word salad yeah we trying to hide the fact that you're crying how's inside DC so confident it's from so fast you're already drying before you know it in their cups and off to their box oh you reforming them they're not good enough a little squished to a Clara they want to flatten down a little bit things if you after you guys cut them you guys have to cover

watery charts are honest Oh and our goal and on info for you the Britain's cannula to they just have to talk for the really big big boys and then it kind of masks your bad accent which is funny because I think that there's our real ya know and that's my bet because I can't do a British accent and also if you tell someone if you tell someone from England that you're doing a British accent they'll get mad at you and tell you that there's like 40 different types of accents sorry sooo yeah so that way the lair Brits hope all of our British subscribers and subscribing [Music] Oh Oh dad yeah once I had to make sure your spacings a little further apart yeah oh I would never make a mistake Oh what actually the wheel stopped the wheel so I'm getting past this Will's angry over don't go so it these girls did this bill down there apparently if this wheel shifts to that side then it starts pulling the whole paper that way and then it pulls it out of the one wheel and then if there's only one wheel call you yeah Robert to use an elbow grease 20 because vegans can try harder things but as long as they're not too much suffering because humans are as humans or animals too some are right so what about like wigs made out of people hair as long as there was no suffering during the haircutting I guess so like if we found a way to have animals talk okay no I've already asked you this it's a health thing for you so you said no but I'm OK for the ethical vegans out there if animals could talk and they were like yeah I'm cool with giving up my meat would you be okay with eating it if are they gonna be dying of old age or are you gonna be killing them early what if they didn't care what if they were just like yeah I'm alive for you to eat me I know it's a brain teaser but what if it was I mean where where's the ethical line yeah well I guess if an inn didn't care about its life if it literally wanted yeah like if it was like a wavy scene Rick and Marty know how there's a mr. meeseeks and like he he doesn't want to live it's like they're they're like a certain type of alien we're like they have to like help the person that summons them and then once they accomplish their goal then they disappear but if they you know survive for longer than a couple hours it seems like forever for them so they're like get me out of here yeah they're like you know I just want to accomplish my goal and you know yeah I mean you know the universe is a big place yeah I think we'd like that show seducing I don't know farlows watch it but Carlos told me to watch it about a million times yeah I keep telling him it's pretty good I mean it's on Hulu I think you have all right I need to get it I think actually can go to Rick and Morty taught in that or something like that and watch it for free so oh yeah without this yeah there's no I don't think design commercials either there's just like to pop-up ads that you have to just not click on so you don't get viruses or you know whatever or not to say that I'm a millionaire good no I think things actually shopping ones so you probably it's probably not a virus is probably just like buying stuff but I don't know about you guys but we'll never anything like that pops up I look at the I try to make sure to find out what the company is like oh that's a company yeah I'm never gonna buy anything from you I don't cut you in Ellie's I never buy anything yeah and if it was a restaurant that I frequent there kind of advertising me I probably just get hungry yeah a lot of people say they watch this late at night and they get hungry and that's just not going here so yeah that's approaching so who's wait until the next morning today like a lot of people said they watch it with their morning coffee or whatever and we do have coffee cups my drink their coffee out of my hercules cup while watching Hercules yeah and a lot of people said they like order their hurkos Kantian eat it while they're watching us and succeed or just other like you know if they're like really far away and can't get the candy it'll just beat candy while watching cosmic candy so they don't get hungry yeah people in like Australia like technology is just not there again we can't get the airplane yeah I'm sure there are but you'd have to pay like 600 bucks for shipping yeah yeah because it you got to pay for two two day shipping to Australia which is literally the other side of the world and they're you know it's two days shipping with that plus the ice packs buying a little bit of jet fuel yeah yeah the only last 48 hours so when we get an ice pack that lasts like a week or two then maybe what if you just put an extra one in there yeah yeah there you go yeah first 48 hours one goes next 48 hours another goes that's what we should tell them hey guys just keep this in the freezer for two days and then put him in this box yeah and reseal it and yeah you know I think that they were totally down the road watch it out there did that going back for me you kept it on you're working too much Eclipse team do you know how many trades you've done so far yeah or oh those cases fifth one charlie trick me huh yeah what he did that he did the last one first don't worry I won't tell corporate okay probably older get in trouble well I might put onion and that's know just depends if they're watching YouTube yeah is any harder test and a lot of world in keeping somebody off the air meaning keeping somebody off the internet yeah I mean you know if it was your task to be like this person can't go on the internet for the next like week Wow don't go camping and a place that doesn't have service now tell him to go camping yeah I wasn't seeing the spectrum commercial sour it's like you can watch TV anywhere the examiner we we went camping in the Finger Lakes and we still had data for YouTube and I Virgin Mobile which you pay 30 bucks a month for it so you get data data coverage that's worth $30 a month that goes really far yeah so I was surprised I mean it wasn't like the best but I'm still in excess lean man thank you for Google on how do you do this is this mushroom edible how to start a fire when the Sun is already yeah we forgot our magnifying glass to freeze in the middle of summer I went down to 50 degrees how do you know going down that part yeah cuz I remember I had a hoodie and I was like yeah I slept on top of my sleeping bag and I was there oh my god yeah yeah well got another 30 seconds before this first came around automatically stops recording it's been 20 minutes and 40 29 minutes and 40 seconds so you guys got about another 15 seconds Danny any last famous last words dead this is it right here this trick say it well laughs that's a close one [Music]", "5qhY7mhw30g": "We're Adam and Joanne from inspiredtaste.net and welcome to our kitchen.  We're making our chocolate covered caramels.  Before making our salted caramels... we always make sure we have our equipment\nready and all ingredients measured out... here is a loaf pain, we are going to lightly oil it... then we are going to cut a piece of parchment paper... lightly oil that... and then insert that inside the loaf pan... which makes our lives a lot easier when we want to unmold the caramels when we are done. Next for the ingredients, we need to measure a half cup... of heavy whipping cream. Then grab one stick of butter which is also about a half cup... and cut that into eight... equally sized pieces. Add that to a bowl... then add the cream... and place it into the microwave... and cook for about a minute until the\nbutter has melted and the cream is hot... set that aside... and measure out a quarter cup of light corn syrup... and one cup of granulated white sugar. Now grab a small saucepan... add three tablespoons of water to the saucepan... then grab the corn syrup that you just measured out and add that to the saucepan. Next for the sugar... add it, but try your best not to splatter the sugar up the sides of the pan. Then just use a spoon or spatula... to stir the sugar into the water and corn syrup.  Heat to medium... then bring to a boil. Now once it is at a boil we want to make sure there isn't... any sugar crystals stuck to the side of the pan... since this can cause something called crystallization which can make your caramels grainy... and really ruin the texture. To help with this, just cover with the lid for about one minute. Remove the lid and attach a candy thermometer.  You will want to cook the sugar until it reaches 320 degrees F. At this temperature the sugar will take on a light amber color... now we are ready to add the butter and cream mixture from before... add it in small batches then use the candy thermometer to stir it into the sugar mixture.  As you do this the caramel will bubble violently... so you really want to do this slowly and\ncarefully so nothing bubbles over.  Now place the candy thermometer... back on the side of the pan... and cook the caramel to 240 degrees F... this will create a soft caramel. If you want harder caramels... cook to about 245 degrees F.  Now pour the caramel into your prepared loaf pan... and let it sit for about fifteen to twenty minutes.  While you wait it's best to clean your pot and candy thermometer... fill the pot with water, place the candy thermometer into the water... and bring the water to a boil... this will melt away all of the caramel... making cleanup really easy. After about three and a half... to four hours... you'll find that the caramel has set... and we can cut it. We like to cut into one-inch squares... but it's up to you. Next for the chocolate, you need one pound of chocolate. You can use milk, dark... or even white chocolate for this... We like to use semi-sweet. Give it a chop and add to a microwave safe bowl... along with two tablespoons of butter... but reserve about a third cup...  of the chocolate... to add later.  Add the bowl to the microwave and heat for about forty-five seconds.  After forty-five seconds give it a stir. The chocolate won't be melted yet... so you will have to put it back in for another forty-five seconds or so.  Again stir... and continue to do this until the\nchocolate has melted. Now grab the third cup of chocolate from earlier and stir that in. Stir until it is melted and shiny. Now we can coat the caramels... add the caramels one-by-one into the chocolate... then use two forks to pick them up out of the chocolate.  Then place them onto either wax paper or a cooling rack... then top with salt... and set them aside to harden and cool. Enjoy!", "ao7eg4s36DY": "what's going on this is dr. Mike Hansen and in\u00a0\nthis video we're talking about CBD what is CBD\u00a0\u00a0 the story behind cannabidiol the cannabis product\u00a0\nthat gets you well not high you've heard of CBD\u00a0\u00a0 the cannabis product whose popularity has reached\u00a0\nalmost crazed lake proportions CBD has come from\u00a0\u00a0 nowhere to everywhere in just the last few years\u00a0\nit is perhaps best known for its ability to\u00a0\u00a0 reduce anxiety and promote happiness but CBDs\u00a0\napplications are seemingly endless it's been\u00a0\u00a0 successfully used to help with pain insomnia and\u00a0\ndepression there are some reports that it helps\u00a0\u00a0 with other medical conditions as well because\u00a0\nof its wide range of uses CBD infused products\u00a0\u00a0 are the fastest growing segment of the health\u00a0\nindustry even some pets are getting in on the\u00a0\u00a0 action for example CBD troubles are used to calm\u00a0\ndogs Carl's jr. the fast food chain has created a\u00a0\u00a0 burger served with a CBD infused sauce not that\u00a0\nI endorse calls jr. or any fast food for that\u00a0\u00a0 matter and New York City CBD infused coffee was\u00a0\nall the rage and sell at the camp and then there\u00a0\u00a0 is medical celebrities dr. oz and dr. Sanjay\u00a0\nGupta who actually advocate for CBD as well as\u00a0\u00a0 non-medical celebrities such as Joe Rogan Morgan\u00a0\nFreeman Quentin Paltrow then you got athletes such\u00a0\u00a0 as David Wells who argue on behalf of CBD use\u00a0\nin sports medicine where it's anti-inflammatory\u00a0\u00a0 power would allow players to recover more quickly\u00a0\nand not risk opioid addiction there are plenty of\u00a0\u00a0 MMA fighters who swear by it as well in Bubba\u00a0\nWatson a professional golfer said that his\u00a0\u00a0 decisions UCB was quote-unquote a no brainer the\u00a0\nFDA even joined the bandwagon last year at least\u00a0\u00a0 partially approving the CBD medication at the\u00a0\ndialects this is despite the fact that cannabis\u00a0\u00a0 remains illegal in eyes of the federal government\u00a0\nso CBD use is growing by leaps and bounds with a\u00a0\u00a0 projected twenty two billion dollar market by the\u00a0\nyear 2022 CBD is cannabidiol which is derived from\u00a0\u00a0 the flower of cannabis the only plant genus that\u00a0\ncontains YOUnique class of molecular compounds\u00a0\u00a0 called phytochemicals so there's more than 8500\u00a0\ncannabinoids that have been identified but the\u00a0\u00a0 two most prevalent are tetrahydrocannabinol\u00a0\naka THC and cannabidiol which is CBD THC is\u00a0\u00a0 the psychoactive ingredient of cannabis meaning\u00a0\nTHC is the component that gets you high while\u00a0\u00a0 CBD is the quote/unquote anti psychoactive\u00a0\ningredient meaning it doesn't get you high\u00a0\u00a0 there are actually two types of cannabis plants\u00a0\nmeaning there are two subspecies one is marijuana\u00a0\u00a0 which is rich in THC and thus has been cultivated\u00a0\nfor the high associated with its recreational use\u00a0\u00a0 and then there is hemp which is low in THC hemp\u00a0\nwas historically cultivated for the industrial\u00a0\u00a0 uses or its tough fibers in December of 2018\u00a0\nin part because a growing body of scientific\u00a0\u00a0 evidence showing CBDs therapeutic attributes\u00a0\nthe federal government legalized him although\u00a0\u00a0 33 states have legalized medical marijuana\u00a0\nincluding 10 states with legal recreational\u00a0\u00a0 use marijuana remains prohibited at the federal\u00a0\nlevel so both hemp and marijuana contains CBD\u00a0\u00a0 the recent full legalization of hemp is part\u00a0\nof the reason why some experts believe the CBD\u00a0\u00a0 market will have a societal impact as monumentous\u00a0\nas the tech revolution two decades ago but to\u00a0\u00a0 really understand what CBD is and why it is only\u00a0\nso recently burst into such almost revolutionary\u00a0\u00a0 prominence it helps to know a little bit about\u00a0\nthe history of cannabis and the biology of its use\u00a0\u00a0 cannabis is believed to have been used medicinally\u00a0\nrecreationally and for spiritual reasons\u00a0\u00a0 throughout much of humankind's history it's been\u00a0\nused in some form by societies throughout the\u00a0\u00a0 world the oldest known written record regarding\u00a0\nits use comes from almost 5000 years ago in\u00a0\u00a0 China ancient Greeks used it to dress wounds at\u00a0\nhorses and to apply to human nosebleeds it was\u00a0\u00a0 medicinally popular among Vikings and medieval\u00a0\nGermans for relieving pain during childbirth and\u00a0\u00a0 for toothaches while Queen Elizabeth used cannabis\u00a0\nto relieve her menstrual cramps but only in recent\u00a0\u00a0 decades it's have we come to understand how\u00a0\nand why cannabis affects humans the plant\u00a0\u00a0 was largely excluded from scientific study due to\u00a0\nits widespread illegality until the 1960s when an\u00a0\u00a0 Israeli chemist named Rafael McCollum McCullum was\u00a0\nable to obtain confiscated hashish from police and\u00a0\u00a0 study it he elucidated the structure of THC and\u00a0\nCBD and then in 1992 made an even more fundamental\u00a0\u00a0 discovery the existence of the endocannabinoid\u00a0\nsystem meaning the EC s in the human body so the\u00a0\u00a0 EC s is the body's largest system of receptors and\u00a0\nit's found throughout the brain nervous system and\u00a0\u00a0 organs it's been described as the molecular bridge\u00a0\nbetween the body and the mind scientists have come\u00a0\u00a0 to believe the EC s is among the most important\u00a0\nphysiological systems involved in human health\u00a0\u00a0 because it regulates both mood and homeostasis\u00a0\nkeeping internal systems balanced in the face of\u00a0\u00a0 external stress and inflammation he said that by\u00a0\nusing a plant that has been around for thousands\u00a0\u00a0 of years we discovered a new physiological system\u00a0\nof immense importance we wouldn't have been able\u00a0\u00a0 to get there if we had not looked at the plant\u00a0\nso the implications of this discovery including\u00a0\u00a0 the burgeoning applications of CBD are only\u00a0\nbeginning to take shape and looking at the\u00a0\u00a0 ec s McCullum uncovered naturally occurring\u00a0\nneurotransmitters called endocannabinoids that\u00a0\u00a0 are structurally nearly identical to the phyto\u00a0\ncannabinoids found in cannabis THC mimics these\u00a0\u00a0 endocannabinoids endocannabinoids and binds to\u00a0\nthe two main kinds of receptors in the body cb1\u00a0\u00a0 and cb2 CBD doesn't directly bind the cb1 or cb2\u00a0\nreceptors but instead serves as a real take and\u00a0\u00a0 break down inhibitor preventing the breakdown of\u00a0\nnaturally-occurring endocannabinoids in the body\u00a0\u00a0 this is essentially the same way that selective\u00a0\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs work which\u00a0\u00a0 prevent the reuptake and breakdown of serotonin\u00a0\nin the brain and if you're not familiar with\u00a0\u00a0 SSRIs these are the medications that are mainly\u00a0\nused to treat anxiety and depression think paxil\u00a0\u00a0 zoloft cetera so CBDs health impacts span the\u00a0\nentire endocannabinoid system in particular\u00a0\u00a0 researchers have found a CBD increases the levels\u00a0\nof an and amide and cannabinoid known as the Bliss\u00a0\u00a0 molecule derived from the Sanskrit word Ananda\u00a0\nwhich means extreme happiness or one of the\u00a0\u00a0 highest states of being CBD has shown to generally\u00a0\nserve as a boon for brain health serving as both\u00a0\u00a0 a protectant and enhancing neuroplasticity it's\u00a0\nbeen shown to be effective applied topically in\u00a0\u00a0 reducing inflammation and overall body pain some\u00a0\nearly studies suggest that CBD might help fight\u00a0\u00a0 cancer and has already earned a place in overall\u00a0\ncancer treatment force ability to reduce nausea\u00a0\u00a0 and help with pain and the benefits of CBD appear\u00a0\nto come with little to no side effects according\u00a0\u00a0 to the World Health Organization they said CBD\u00a0\nexhibits no effects indicative of any abuse or\u00a0\u00a0 dependence potential and today there's no evidence\u00a0\nof public health related problems associated with\u00a0\u00a0 the use of pure CBD because this is all relatively\u00a0\nnew science studies of CBDs efficacy in a number\u00a0\u00a0 of treatments are still preliminary and its actual\u00a0\nmarketing is often suspect many products are being\u00a0\u00a0 released without much regulatory oversight and\u00a0\nthe CBD levels and overall quality of CBD products\u00a0\u00a0 are not always as advertised mostly they don't\u00a0\ncome as advertised so some CBD products contain\u00a0\u00a0 unwanted THC which means some people might test\u00a0\npositive for marijuana so you really have to do\u00a0\u00a0 your research to learn what CBD brands you can\u00a0\ntrust besides determining the safety and efficacy\u00a0\u00a0 of CBD for various medical conditions there are\u00a0\nlots of other questions that scientists need to\u00a0\u00a0 answer for example what form of CBD should be\u00a0\ntaken what is the recommended dosage and much\u00a0\u00a0 more so there's a

these folks", "qIRyjXztg4o": "today on the domestic geek I'm going to show you how to make soft chewy salted caramel bites these make the most incredible gift or just keep them all for yourself now this salted caramel I promise you will absolutely blow your mind but it is a bit of a labor of love so you want to make sure that you have all your ingredients prepared beforehand and all of the utensils that you are going to need in addition I have prepared a pan like this all I've done is taken some parchment paper and laid it out in two sheets across a nine by nine baking pan I also have greased it with a little bit of canola oil be sure to prepare your pan beforehand then I've set out all my ingredients we have a cup and a half of sugar a quarter cup of corn syrup a quarter cup of water then we have a cup of cream a quarter cup of butter and a quarter of a teaspoon of salt to that we're going to add a tablespoon of vanilla now I also have two pots standing by so I have a small saucepan this is going to heat our cream our butter and our salt and then I have a much larger saucepan now you want to make sure when you're working with sugar that you're working with a large saucepan because it tends to bubble up whenever you add anything I also have a candy thermometer now I highly recommend if you were going to be making caramel to invest in a candy thermometer mine was $8 but it's totally worth the investment because honestly temperature can make or break your caramel the other thing that is worth the investment is a good pastry brush now basically I just dampen this with some water and we're going to use it to brush the sides of the pan just in case any rogue sugar crystals get outside of the actual sugar mixture itself one little sugar crystal can ruin your entire batch of caramel so we're going to start by heating our cream mixture now we're going to do this over about medium heat in our large saucepan we are going to mix a quarter cup of water a quarter cup of corn syrup and then a cup and a half of good old-fashioned sugar you really want to work on pouring your sugar in the center of your pot you were trying to avoid getting any along the sides and then just using a spatula you should incorporate it until all of the sugar is moistened and then we're going to turn our heat to about medium hot what we're looking for is this sugar to heat up to 300 degrees so our cream mixture is heated our butter is melted and we want to turn this off the heat because we don't want to scold this she's going to use my damp pastry brush brush down the sides to make sure I haven't gotten any sugar crystals up the side of the pan now once we start heating this we never stir it again you'll start to see some small bubbles forming around the side as it heats and then eventually it will all fill in and become just one big bubbly concoction a couple quick notes of caution when you are working with candy the first thing is you never want to leave it unattended it burns very quickly in addition to that this concoction gets very very hot and can scold you very easily so use extreme caution so our sugar has reached 300 degrees turn off the heat in goes our cream and butter mixture this will bubble up so just be very cautious as you're mixing we are going to turn the heat back on and now we're going to wait for the temperature to return to about 245 degrees all right so we have reached two hundred and forty-five degrees we are going to take this guy off the heat we're going to add a splash of vanilla you're going to see quite a reaction when that vanilla gets added a man we want to make sure when we're stirring it we are not scraping the bottom because you don't want any burnt bits coming off we're just gonna slam it on the counter a couple times to get out any air bubbles that may have formed while it was cooking then we're gonna leave this and let it set for about thirty minutes all right so our caramel has been setting for about 30 minutes now it's time to just top it with some salt I'm using pink Himalayan sea salt but you could use any salt you like you could use some fleur de sel or some coarse sea salt you just want to make sure that you can see it on the surface because it adds a really beautiful aesthetic to your final product our beautiful caramel is perfectly set it's been sitting for about two and a half hours now as you can see is very sticky which is why it's so critical that we really boiled our parchment paper well and look at that because we're going to be giving these away as gifts we're just going to discard this sighs this is all for you to eat don't sweat now when you're cutting this caramel you want to make sure you are using a really sharp knife and that you have secured your cutting board to the counter I would not want to see any accidents and what you have are these perfect little chewy caramel bites look at the texture of that now you can imagine just by looking at it how chewy it's going to be but of course I'll taste it just in case oh my gosh what I've done is created these little wax paper rectangles these are perfect for a wrapping and rolling each individual little caramel bite now I like to put its salt side down to preserve the sort of prettiness of that then just twist make these I promise you will not be disappointed they are worth every moment that you put into them and they totally melt in your mouth subscribe to the domestic geek for more deliciousness just like this", "hmgcM2Gxc5Y": "Oh [Music] haha what's up folks so I'm at the grocery store I'm going to show you the ins and outs what to look for what to get what's not yet when you come to the store because a lot of y'all don't know I didn't know so let's go figure this out first and foremost I want you all to realize that this is not going to be a short video as you can see it's almost a half hour long because there's a lot to go over I'm a personal trainer first and my personal training heart wants to show you the ins and outs of the grocery store so let's do this together and let's do it right okay first things first is fruit you can't go wrong with roots you can't go wrong with anything that grows up out of the ground to be perfectly on it when it comes to watermelon comes the cantaloupes when it comes to melons when it comes to apples you cannot go wrong with these things just like berries there are so many different uses of berries you can just freeze them and people for a long time they're fibrous they're nutritious each of some berries also onions onions the benefits of onions are just endless I eat onions every single day and then there's things like corn make sure you're getting good corn not just corn from a canned pineapples especially after you work out if you need a splash of sweetness in your smoothies pineapples are great tomatoes gotta love them tomatoes are something that eat at least five out of the seven days every week and if you're having salad cherry tomatoes they are so good they give you that splash of flavors flavor that your body actually craves garlic oh the benefits of garlic are immense and then these little halos like oranges tangerine tangelos all these little things your body's craving sweetness instead of going for a candy bar go for these kind of fruits even great they're sweet they're good whether they're red seedless like these or the green grape they're good stuff bananas bananas are a wonderful thing to wake up and eat they're a good source of carbs they're also something to eat right before you go to sleep avocados there's many uses out of hock avocados just like guacamole avocados are great it's a great choice potatoes they're sweet potatoes there's yams there's all sorts of things little red potatoes they even sell these potatoes individually wrapped if you just want to have a baked potato asparagus goodness I love asparagus put a little bit of butter stuff on there there's green beans Brussels sprouts if it's green it'll get you lean straight up I'm telling you now I mean you just walk through the grocery store and you will see a lot of different things in the vegetable in the fruit section and if you go to like a more local food store like this one is Bueller's in my town you'll see so many fresh vegetables locally grown support your local farmers support your local grocery stores because stores like Walmart are really lacking in the quality now talking about lacking in the quality let's get into fruit juices these things like naked drinks and baths out farm they're all sugar sugar sugar stay away then we got these little things called hummus this is something you should gravitate towards there's a lot of fat in hummus but it's a healthy alternative snack something that should absolutely stay away from birthday cakes pastries these sorts of things anything that's cooked with sugar on top of the sugar inside of it sugar sugar sugar yes it looks good I'm a cake lover I used to love donuts eat this stuff all the time years of my life gone and wasted but folks this stuff isn't good for you it's simply not good for you just keep passing it up and I'm going to keep showing you things that you need to pass up in these grocery stores folks so just so you know another thing you need to pass up is pop get alone diet pop any kind of pop normal pop has a bunch of sugar in it and high-fructose corn syrup if not both but Diet pops has asked the change has a lot of bad things just like Gatorade you really need to stay away from Gatorade to be perfectly honest if you want to drink something to give you those electrolytes drink BCAAs honestly just buy a top of BCAAs stay away from fruit juice if you want real fruit juice you need to be looking for the fruit juice in glass bottles they usually at the end of the aisle but they're more expensive because it's legitimate fruit juice not some processed sugar based garbage but they're in glass bottles if you want some kind of juice to give you flavor kinda like a water like thing these buy drinks they I I don't know how to say it but those drinks are something I would gravitate towards because it's a little bit of flavor about ten calories now obviously chips there's a lot of the things in this aisle it's just chip aisle you need to stay away from plain and simple but one thing you can have is skinny pop these boom chicka pop these kettle corn they're sea salt there's all these different flavors they're vegan friendly they taste great in their calorie great like go get some of that go get some kettle corn in your life and if anything go make some make your own you don't need to buy this processed garbage in the stores just make your own in the end of the aisles normally there's these nuts like bold sriracha Blue Diamond nuts go get some that'll get you some flavor in your life so you don't need all these chips and pretzels and everything I mean look - look - honestly let's look at the back of a pack is a pretzel rod right here there's one gram of fiber there's 22 grams of carbs with just not a good ratio and then there's 110 calories so honestly you're not getting much fiber in there so all of that all those carbs you going straight to your bloodstream don't you don't really need prep books if you really want a good snack go get some pickles in your life now I just picked up a jar bread and butter pickles there's five grams of sugar in there so you need to be careful look how much to consume they might want to go for like a more natural like brand like that but pickles are a good alternative if you need something different in your diet something to crunch on a little bit something something sweet even apple cider vinegar I'll link that video up above there's endless benefits of apple cider vinegar make sure you have two tablespoons without a day at least you can use that for a lot of things I know a lot of people have mayo or mayonnaise or Miracle Whip I personally choose just Mayo because the ingredients are right the macros are right and the taste is right it'll be less calories and less fat for your soul another thing you can use honestly in a lot of different ways is mustard now let's look at what mustard actually has to bring the table besides zero calories zero carbs here of protein plus or zero fat the only thing that's in mustard is sodium in a very minimal amount now honestly look at a honey mustard like this is Dijon honey mustard French's and it's flipped out around there's only five calories there's only there's there's nothing in there there's less sodium in the honey mustard and there is a normal mustard so if you need something to flavor up your salad or to flavor up your life go get some mustard don't go towards salad dressing now no high fructose corn syrup in ketchup that's something that a lot of people didn't even realize that's in ketchup but it is so make sure that you're getting ketchup out the hyper good corn syrup in there's only 20 calories in ketchup anyway it's not that bad but even this ketchup that says hey I have no preservatives and people like oh it's gotta be healthy then let's look at that horrible thing that's on the ingredient hi corn syrup that's something that you need to stay away from like the flag folks and it's in a lot of salad dressings too but if you're one of these people and you eat there and we need then there's these salad dressings like you want like this Greek yogurt salad dressing this is one that you need to go gravitate towards there's only 60 calories only two grams of sugar there's only 5 grams of fat which is actually really low for salad dressing there's only 240 milligrams of sodium that's a really good salad dressing to grow towards but let's compare it to another one let's just say wishbone ranch is great for dipping the calories are more than double the fat is more than double the everything else is almost more than double the sodium's about the same but goodness gracious you can go get the same flavor for half the calories now one thing since I'm vegan I don't get meat dairy eggs that sort of stuff in my diet so I go for gluten-free pancakes because usually there's no eggs in there there's nothing in there that I can eat and guess what it tastes great and guess what the calories are actually comparable if not less every single time than like any other pancake brand so if you are like me go for a gluten-free pancakes if you didn't know what to do or those recipes just haven't been working out because that's been my baby this you trying to find a vegan pancake recipe that doesn't say sandy now soups we all like soup right a lot of us like soup it's quick it's easy this is just a can you can eat the whole thing but you got to be careful everything that says no preservative preservatives added it might have to actually be careful of 890 grams of sodium when you only see having 2000 2500 per day that's not good that's going to keep you swollen up that's going to just do some wonderful not so wonderful things to your heart to your kidney stay away from anything with that much sodium gravitate towards more things that you can make if you want to make soup then go buy black beans go fine if it means kidney beans beans beans beans the more you eat the more you poop yes the music the musical root huh we're getting off track I hate beans every single day another thing that I eat a lot of the time is rice there's nothing wrong with white rice there's nothing wrong with brown rice go eat some rice the difference is the flavor and the difference is a little bit of a fiber there's going to be a little bit more fiber in the brown rice in the white rice but nevertheless it's a great source of carbs have at it and actually take the time to make it because when you get into these little pockets right here then you just add water you just warm up what you're going to be doing is you're going to be getting into high sodium one of those little packets obviously you're going to use more than one serving so more than one serving is that you're going to be getting at least a thousand milligrams of sodium which is just crazy like this uncle print Ben's Minute Rice right here look at this one it actually focuses in come on camera there's seven hundred and seventy milligrams up just a half a bag of sodium in this thing because we both of that and you eat both servings in that bag you're done for the day like I said go actually make the stuff by normal rice by normal bean by normal things take the time to cook it that's what a crock pots for you make all you mix all this stuff up do it overnight do it before you go to work so you come home and you actually have good food to eat especially because what most of us don't have a lot of time get some teen wall in your life does anybody actually ever made quinoa salad with vegetables with beans it's so good look up quinoa salad recipes on Pinterest it's good stuff jazz Motty rice up yes get some please now you got to watch out for sois because yes it's low in calories but look at that sodium that is incredibly intense and most of us use multiple servings of that try to go towards coconut secret coconut aminos it tastes just like soy sauce I don't even understand how they do it but look at the sodium only 90 milligrams that's phenomenal even the calories are cut in half go get yourself some coconut secret same thing for teriyaki sauce because that is something that holds in a lot sodium as well this is the pasta that I recommend to everybody in this whole wide world dream seals I'll talk about this before I really have in multiple videos now let me get these calories and proteins and all this stuff up on here 190 calories 1 gram of fat there's 5 grams of fiber and you got soluble and insoluble and you've got 7 grams of protein industry and all of the different kinds that they have is the same it tastes great it doesn't hate healthy you know what I'm talking about something tastes healthy they got lasagna let's see they got macaroni and they got routine E it's so good I would recommend it to the world now what do you put on that kind of pasta obviously you put pasta sauce got to be careful because there's a lot of hidden sugars and pasta sauce and you're like sugar now because people put sugar in their pasta sauce and make it taste better like this 9 grams of sugar now mind you I know for a fact that this pasta sauce tastes great but there is 9 grams of sugar in there so just be careful I'm not saying you should completely stay away from it just be careful how much is of it you're consuming because that's 45 grams of sugar if you eat that whole jar by your bag on self Newman's Own this is my favorite brand it has a little bit less sugar that's 3 grams of fiber they do have organic kinds in this brand and all the donations that you will all the money that you put forth to buy this brand is actually goes towards charity honor percent of the money goes for its charity that's cool going through the cereal aisle with other granola bars and uh this is something I see people buy all the time something that snaps seeing people buy since I've been a little kid these little crunchy bars look at this though there's 11 grams of sugar within that thing most people to eat this for breakfast when they're walking out the door or they take it to school with them and if you're a kid you have just consumed almost half of the sugar that you should be eating every single day just in that moment right there so you got to be careful you just got to be careful what we're feeding our kids what we're feeding ourselves that's not a good choice it's really not just a normal bolt meal if you need something like that in your life to be perfectly honest now let's get into cereals you want to link that video called serial killer above I'll talk about this in deeper context so go check out that video but cereal like Lucky Charms has trisodium phosphate aka something that you stain your deck with to preserve it you shouldn't be putting it inside of your body no matter what the FDA they're lies they have to tell you see this is what General Mills does we don't have all these things in there but we adapt Rises sodium phosphate and no one's saying a daggone thing stay away from this like the plague unless you really want to increase your risk of cancer to be perfectly honest it's that deep and we overlook it and it's in our favorite cereal we know Lucky Charms in Cinnamon Toast Crunch is good but we need to stay away from it like the plague pop-tarts another thing there's really no nutritional value in pop-tarts - oh let's go eat a candy bar there's 18 grams of sugar per pop-tart 210 calories per pop-tart high fructose corn syrup um there is no reason to ever eat a pop-tart there's just there's just not for the sake of your long-term health there's not pure maple syrup if you have to have syrup go pure maple syrup straight from Mother Nature if you have to but if you don't like that kind then go for log cabin no high fructose corn Seraph brand whether you want to delight in or sugar-free or just original go for one of those because normal like Aunt Jemima for example when people focus high fructose corn syrup corn syrup those are the first two ingredients there's no protein there's 32 grams of sugar and Lourdes mill you have like four or five serving to that oh my gosh not worth it pulley not worth it and let's go down the healthy aisle in the freezer section like with all the little microwave meals and stuff and let's just check out a Lean Cuisine meal yes yes yeah you eat these all the time key word used but especially when I was trying to lose weight these things are great because there's only 230 calories there's 7 grams of protein in this there's a lot of there's actually 3 grams of fiber there's 37 grams of carbs you know what this isn't horrible they're 66 or 640 milligrams of sodium so you gotta be careful you got to be careful with how much of these that's you actually eat now I used to eat these little healthy choice bowl with little cafe steamer steamer bowls got me through like I literally lost weight by eating this consumer Bowl because they're like 200 to 300 calories and that's it and there's like almost 30 grams of protein in there so if you're somebody that eats that kind of thing then go get it if you're trying to lose weight but you got to watch out for the sodium now if you're somebody that doesn't really honestly have time to buy these fresh vegetables and cook them up just buy frozen just buy frozen there's a lot of different options of every kind of vegetable you can ever think of all you got to do is warm it up and you're golden now I again being vegan there's a lot of different options for eating things that tastes just like me I don't even understand it but beyond me I'll tell you - the day I die is amazing it tastes and has the texture of just like chicken and beef and all these other things go try it out also if you're on my way of life quinoa burgers there's a lot of different brands there's a lot of different things for like a lot of meat products that you would normally eat like in your former life I'll just go and try them out I highly suggest these Aimee California veggie burgers they are phenomenal I don't know how they do it they're just really good I would never recommend to you anything that tastes best I'm not about that bad tasting food like not at all ice cream speaking of non bad phasing foods freakin ice cream I was just talking to one of my friends in the gym about enlightened ice cream if you have no idea what enlightened is go hit it because it's light its left calories for full flavor just like halo topics sometimes they're on sale like they are and my grocery store and then there's also things that you don't eat dairy products like soy and rice and almond space ice cream there's a lot of different options just kind of go got to go look for even at so delicious brands it's good stuff you're going to pay for it you're going to pay for an end but even Ben & Jerry's has non-dairy selection and they're obviously their normal stuff 7:49 dad gone that's crazy expensive it really is why is the almonds Ben and Jerry's the only ones not on sale y'all notice that stuff what is this how much was the ice cream apparently a sign from God told me I'm not anyways bread I'll tell it to you till the day I die Eureka organic so we bred is the best bread in the whole wide world and I buy it every time I go to the grocery store cuz I'll always in need of it there's a lot of fiber a lot of protein la not so much fat and honestly not so much carbs compared to other bread it's good stuff go get it and tell me how you like it now they put on that grab you know I like missing peanut butter and jelly Smuckers it's right here from my 15 minutes away that's where the main smokers factory is got to support our local this and look at that if you're jelly or jam doesn't have just those ingredients strawberries and sugar and pectin then you need to get a different brand because it's a lot of in there that's why I go for these Naturals specially smokers natural they know what they're doing like the only ingredients in this Smuggler's natural peanut butter is peanuts and salt that's it is 8 grams of protein or off experience of carbs it's not bad for you you just got to watch out how much you eat because it's easy to overeat on peanut butter and jelly it's very easy it's very easy there's a lot of different comparison videos online and oh the peanut butter company Oh have at it that brand is so tasty and speaking of tasty Oh get away from my life Oreos and devil the devil get away from me there's a lot of cookies and there's a lot of things in the cookie aisle shocking that you just need to stay away from planning something there's there's really no need unless you're having a cheat meal that your planned out to eat these cookies even these crackers these cheese's these club crackers these saltines they hold no nutritional value but there's things like Triscuits that we need to take a closer look into because these are deemed more healthy now look at this there's only 2 grams of fiber that ratio between vibrant carps are good one gram of fiber per 10 carbs is a good ratio Triscuits are solid I would read go eat some Triscuits there's a little bit of protein in there the first ingredient is long grain brown rice and whole grain wheat are the two first ingredients go get it go get some brown rice red roasted red pepper Triscuit stay away from Ritz crackers oh it says roses vegetable roasted and their vegetable let's go no no no there's no fiber so all that's going to hit your bloodstream real quick and there's a ton of stats too ton of fat in there so you're eating sugar and fat plain as simple as that you just might as well just go eat some fruity pebbles be perfectly honest now let's look at the butter a lot of us have butter toast in the morning we put butter in our oatmeal we put butter in our rice there's a lot of uses but er but we have to make a good choice because this is a big calorie dense object now there's only 80 calories in this earth dollars there's only 9 grams of fat there's full-flavored it's a good option it's organic even so I don't know why you would stay away from it there's a lot of benefits to it I personally use the Smart Balance brand there's Omega threes or olive oil it helps your cholesterol levels and let's just look at the actual macros of this all honestly it's full of flavors I recommend it to anybody in the whole wide world I've talked about this multiple times only 80 calories only 9 grams of fat only 90 milligrams of sodium have at it to be perfectly honest have at it let's compare that to a local brand from around here heartless dairy hundred grams of fat are 100 calories 11 grams of fat but ton more saturated fat a lot more sodium just like milk milk there's a lot better options for milk if you for calorie wise for protein wise for the macro wise to not just taste between a hundred and and in only 30 calories you can't go wrong with almond milk with coconut milk with not milk with soya milk and perfectly honest compared to normal milk and might have all these supporting factors in there might be organic but under 30 calories 5 grams of fat 12 grams of sugar dude stand away from milk at all top honestly if you literally just compare it to almond milk let's look at this just normal almond milk 60 calories there's only 60 calories in there now you might not get as much protein in there but you're going to have less sugar less calories less fat I don't know what you're doing now let's ground this video off with juice because juice is one of those things a lot of people have growing up even possibly right now on your frigerator it's basically drinking a milkshake to be perfectly honest you might as well just go buy a milkshake it's all sugar it's just plain sugar and this one in particular 23 grams of sugar 23 grams good night and that is where we end folks there's nothing else I have to show you in the store about to talk to you in my car here in about three two one the rap vote mount rocket science for the same time it's a huge learning curve I went three years of my life and had no idea of any of these things it's aimlessly buying just looking at calories protein fat and carbs those things and mind you you will lose weight if you just follow protein fats and carbs under a calorie based diet like a advocate of macros like things but you got to look for other things for the sake of you overall health like your sodium like the sugar like fiber these little things matter in the long run because if you're only in it for the short time yes you will lose weight but yes your heart rate will increase yes kidneys will have issues yes cancer it will increase the risk of it I'm saying you got to look at the ingredients you got to actually know what you're putting into your body and got to actually know what you're doing to it long term it's not about this short term it's not about just living for today it's about trying to live 90 years from now healthy and not having regrets thinking man I wish I wouldn't have filled my body full of crap and you know what half the stuff in the grocery store is crap that's why I wanted to go to the store and show you this stuff so that you know what to go to want to stay away from it'll cut your grocery shop baton down in half and you can thank me later honestly but I hope you love this video please share it with those ones that you love because you want them to be

pretty self-explanatory here's how it's going to go I'm going to throw two minutes up on the clock and explain to you one diet tip that I found that's helped me and hopefully you can help you too if you guys like this idea and what we do more videos like this make sure if you press the like button down below and subscribe to the channel if you're new because I'm dropping content all the time and you need to be here see it alright so two minutes on the clock starting now let's get into it today I want to talk to you about powdered peanut butter quick background powder peeler is literally peanut butter that has been dehydrated and has no oils or water in it the ingredients are just peanuts and salt and all you have to do is mix it with some sort of liquid whether it be water I like almond milk and that's how you get your creamy peanut butter consistency from the powder so there are a bunch of benefits of powdered peanut butter I'm gonna go over a few of them with you right now the first one is calories there are 50 calories in two tablespoons of powdered peanut butter whereas if you're talking about peanut butter you're gonna be looking at around 200 to 210 calories in two tablespoons of peanut butter not to mention that you're getting about the same volume of both of these foods so a quarter of the calories for the same volume sounds like a win to me number two it is taste the taste of this stuff is pretty dang close to peanut butter I mean it's made from peanuts so you're still getting that super nutty delicious taste and a lot of people crave up next flavor options there are so many flavor options of powdered peanut butter maybe more than normal peanut butter you have things like chocolate normal almond almond butter ya have almond butter it's incredible so there's definitely a lot to choose from whenever you're picking out your powdered peanut butter and they're all around the same calories the next benefit is macros the macros of powdered peanut butter are 5 grams of carbs one and a half grams of fat in 5 grams of protein you really can't ask for better macros like I said and that makes up the 50 calories which is two tablespoons of this stuff also there's so many options not only in flavors but also in what you can mix this stuff in you can put it into protein shakes pancake mixes put it on top of yogurt put it with milk boy happier with your cereal put it in your oatmeal there's just so many options to use this to either enhance your food or anywhere that you would normally use peanut butter this would go great so there are just some of the benefits that go in with this powdered peanut butter right here now there are a couple downsides one being that does take a little bit of time to make so you have to get your tablespoon measure I just keep one in the container but you have to get a tablespoon measure measure out two tablespoons and then you have to measure out two tablespoons of some kind of liquid whether it be water on the whatever and then mix it together it takes a minute or so but the ease of use isn't quite as easy as typical peanut butter you get it out stick your finger in it whatever and there you go and another downside I don't know if this one's really that true but from what I've looked up you can't make a bunch of it and store it I can't make this entire thing and then just store the peanut butter in this thing I guess for some reason the peanuts start to ferment or something and it gets bad I don't really know but I've read on the internet that you can't make a bunch of it at once so I have it alright so that concludes my 2-minute diet tip did I stay within two minutes I don't know if I didn't go leave a comment down below and give me some hate if I did go leave a comment down below

because we by Carlos was for their awesome so when you make them yourself they're given better [Music] an excuse off karma bizarre so crazy good [Music] I'm a huge fan of parchment paper I use it for everything it works especially well with these caramel caramel they're difficult to get out of pan so with the parchment paper they lift right out [Music] beneath the mullet really takes the guesswork out of making candy they works especially well with these caramels because it's different between just a couple degrees determines what the kernels are soft or hard just make sure that the amount it doesn't touch the ballot pan most caramel rest is cooked to about two or 45 degrees I feel slightly under that about 244 or 243 degrees so these caramels are bit softer turn the vanilla and quickly importance the pan because even though the pan has been removed from the heat that comes off still cooking you can purchase candy wrappers at craft stores or online you can cut your own wrappers using wax paper I make a lot of caramel so I broke down by paper cutter night of law sighs I cut my wrappers is four by three inches my mother-in-law has a wonderful memory of her childhood when she was a little girl she would watch her older sister and I mother make divinity for the holidays it was one of the things that was something that you meet once a year it was a lot of work but this meant the holidays are here it was such a magical and special moment it was making candy together but it was so much more than that it was - together it was laughing and sharing and making a special treat and I think that story inspired me to begin my journey to try making different candies actually this caramel recipe is the first candy I ever try to make and I found to be a fun and easy way to make candy there are so many ways you can make it your own you can add different flavorings and extract you can add dry fruit shop nuts you can add chocolate to the caramel you can take the finished caramel and dip them in chocolate which is incredible I hope you try this recipe and have fun with it and make wonderful members of your own [Music] thanks for watching please click the subscribe leave me a comment let me know you think visit me at Cucina for counseling [Music]", "I0xAz9K3gMQ": "hello I'm here at the chromosome doily shop in Soho and one of my favorite flavors in the world is caramel I can pretty much eat caramel in any form at all like hard candy caramels and liquid caramel sauce and spung sugar but I think my favorite way to eat caramel is chewy salted caramels and lucky for you guys I've got a brilliant recipe which I'm about to share with you now let's go so we're making caramels it's really important to have everything ready because we're getting into really hot temperatures and very specific temperatures as well and so you don't really faffing around halfway through trying to measure stuff out when you're just at the right temperature and because you're going to ruin your caramel so the first thing we do is get on gradients measured so I have three hundred and sixty grams of double cream a teaspoon of vanilla extract a teaspoon of sea salt flakes three hundred and sixty grams of golden syrup 420 grams of caster sugar and 120 grams of chopped unsalted butter and once you have all your ingredients ready then it's time to prepare the tin now I'm using a six and a half by ten and a half inch tin just about an inch high and you need to line this with foil and it's really important to get the for the right way up if you put it the shiny side up then all your caramels going to stick to it and this happened to me recently you have to pick it off and it takes absolutely ages so don't do that put it with the dull side up and make sure you press it in really really well and once all your foil is really snug in your tin you then need to grease it really lightly using a kind of flavorless oil like vegetable oil or ground nut oil something similar to that it's important to make sure you cover all the sides in the bottom but be careful not to use too much oil because you don't want it to be swimming and oil when you put it out so just so you know I've put the butter in the fridge so there's nice and cold for when we use it now we're going to get on with heating the cream I'm going to heat the cream to almost boiling point and the reason for this is we're going to add it to a really really hot caramel so if it's a bit warm it helps with the bubbling I mean it's always going to bubble because you're adding like sort of slightly cooler stuff to really really hot stuff but this just helps it not kind of explode out the pan so I'm just going to pull that straight into my saucepan and add my vanilla and then 3/4 of my teaspoon of salt and that goes on a medium to high heat to almost boiling point all right that's this I'm just gonna pop a lid on to that and put it to one side for later and now I'm going to bring in my big saucepan now I'm making quite a lot of caramel today you can make less obviously all you need to do is maybe half the recipe so just divide all the ingredients in half you might need a smaller tin or otherwise you're going to have quite flat caramel but I'm making quite a bit and I've got this nice big saucepan and I've got my sugar or candy thermometer already in place and I'm going to put my golden syrup in first and then on top of that I'm going to put my sugar and I'm just going to turn the heat on to medium to high now obviously it's really really important that you don't go off and pop out to the shop or walk the dog or anything like that don't stray too far from your saucepan because it's really important to get it to 155 degrees C and no hotter and obviously you don't want to be out of the room in the Louvre or whatever answering the door when that happens because it's game over for your caramel it's going to take about 8 to 10 minutes to get to where it needs to be which is 155 degrees C and you can give it a stir every now and then with your heatproof spatula or wooden spoon make sure it's a nice long handled wooden spoon or spatula because this does create quite a lot of steam at one point and you don't wanna have your hands stuck in there when it happens okay it's there so I'm just going to turn the heat off and slowly pour my cream in stirring at the same time you see how steamy it is I'm just blowing out of the way so it doesn't go all over my hands so keep stirring until all the bubbles have subsided and then it needs to go back on the heat and you need to get that back up to 127 degrees C so this takes about 8 to 10 minutes as well so just like before don't go anywhere don't go too far don't start putting rollers in your hair or doing your nails really important that you stay close to this to make sure it gets to the right temperature and while it's doing that I've just taken my butter out the fridge that I've got that to hand when I need it right it's there so I'm turning the heat off and I've got my butter ready to go and I'm just gonna plop that in and give it a really good stir it's bubbling quite ferociously so I'm just stirring and stirring and stirring and I want to keep doing that to all the bubbles have stopped and once it's all smooth you just pour that into your prepared tin and let it level itself out now it's got a few air bubbles it's quite hot so be careful but you see to give it a little bang on the surface just to bring all the bubbles to the surface and while it's still wet I'm just going to get the last quarter of a teaspoon of sea salt and just sprinkle it over the top and then just leave that to cool completely that's going to take about an hour or maybe even more than that my caramel is completely cool to the touch no wok at all so now it's time to reveal it and chop it up so I'm just going to turn it upside down onto a sheet of greaseproof paper so doesn't stick to the surface and once you've got your tin off just really gently pull off the foil and if you've done it the right way around it should be fairly easy if there's any bit sort of stuck and a little bit difficult to remove just use a knife to kind of push down on the caramel and pull this foil off so now I'm left with this beautiful slab of delicious looking caramel obviously that's rather large piece for my mouth I could give it a go but probably it wouldn't work so I'm going to chop this into bite-sized pieces and I also have already cut some greaseproof paper into little squares so that I can wrap them up all neat and tidy and I can give them to people or just keep me in a cupboard for myself so make sure you're using a really really sharp knife and I'm using this guy it's I've also oiled it a little bit and I'm not chomping down I'm kind of drawing the point of the knife along otherwise it really sticks to it and once you've cut it into strips you then need to cut it into little bite-sized pieces and then getting your little squares of greaseproof paper just wrap those up and twist the end now the best bit about making caramel is obviously the eating part which does take a while because everything's no hot for such a long time it goes oh we are me mm-hmm oh yeah it's perfectly chewy just enough sticking to my teeth hmm I really hope you made this for me and bring them to me all the time bye thank you so much for watching I hope you enjoyed this video I've certainly enjoyed it because it means now I have a mountain of caramels to eat breakfast lunch and dinner the next week and I'll be back next week with another recipe where these guys are the heroes so don't forget to tune in and if you do make anything from my channel then please take a picture and hashtag using the words

soft and buttery great on their own and used in other recipes to start you'll need to line a loaf tin with parchment or tin foil spray the lining liberally with non-stick cooking spray and set aside [Music] in a small pot combine 120 milliliters of heavy cream and 113 grams of butter [Music] heat this over medium low until the butter is melted [Music] then remove from the heat and set aside [Music] in a separate larger pot add 200 grams of sugar [Music] 60 grams of corn syrup [Music] and 1 tablespoon of water get this over medium heat and heat without stirring heat until the sugar starts to become a light amber color and reaches 320 degrees fahrenheit then stream in the warm butter and cream mixture slowly it will bubble up and then fall back down slightly [Music] now you'll want to heat this until it reaches 245 degrees fahrenheit [Music] once it's come to temperature remove the caramel from the heat and pour into a lined loaf tin [Music] allow the mixture to cool slightly for

of macros last two nights ice cream bowl is Arctic 0 enlighten sea salt caramel I just got these vanilla cupcake goldfish I put that on top with the honey Oh cereal so that his dessert", "vVnJKV8aScc": "hello and welcome to my kitchen at home now I have shared many of my recipes for variety of caramely goodness because I basically think that can I was like one of the best things that's ever been invented and today we're going to step it up again I've got a really great recipe for a really easy treat its chocolate caramels salted chocolate caramels and they're so so delicious now first of all let's talk about the chocolate are you gonna use um I prefer to use a coverture chocolate that is a chocolate which has a little bit more cocoa butter and a little bit less cocoa solids in it I prefer to use a dark coverture chocolate which has usually about 53 54 percent cocoa solids in it and that just makes for a smoother flavor if you can't find that because it is quite a specialist chocolate you can use 70% dark chocolate which is readily available in most supermarkets and it will just have a slightly bitter a darker deeper flavor and which is definitely okay too but you might find it a little bit intense I wouldn't use milk chocolate just because that's already super sweet and we're making caramel which is already very sweet as it is so the first thing we're gonna do is make a chocolate ganache and I have 225 grams of double cream I'm gonna bring that to the boil okay that's come to the boil and I've got 120 grams of my chocolate here and I'm going to pour the cream on top of that so just let that sit for two or three minutes just to warm the chocolate through and then give it a stir and once you've stirred until it's nice and smooth and the chocolate is really well combined with the cream you can leave that to one side just to chill out while you get with the next bit now the first thing to do when you're making the caramels is to prepare your tin and I've got a seven inch by seven inch square tin here and I've lined it with and tinfoil I've lined it the kind of dull side up rather than the shiny side because that is better at non sticking well I've given it a light greasing of just oil and I've wiped the excess off so it's not really super oily so that's ready to go when I need it and to make the caramel I've got a nice heavy based saucepan here and into that I've got 120 grams of golden syrup and with that I'm gonna add 260 grams of caster sugar and that just needs to go over onto the hob onto a medium heat you just need to heat this and it becomes 155 degrees C which is why it's very important to have a sugar thermometer handy you can't kind of wing this and guesswork it it needs to be exactly 155 so now I've taken it off the heat and I'm going to pour my chocolate ganache and give it a good stir and once you've stirred it good and proper and you need to put it back on heat grab your thermometer again and it needs to hit 127 this time hundred 27 degrees C so this is bubbling away it reached 127 so now I'm going to add some butter so just give that a really good stir until all the butter is melted and all the bubbling has completely subsided that's ready so now I'm just going to pour it into my tin and just give it a little bang on the worktop just to get rid of any air bubbles then once you've done that you can sprinkle sea salt on top you don't have to do this but I quite like this salt and the chocolate together mmm that looks and smells amazing now don't forget that this is incredibly hot and it will remain incredibly hot quite some time so just put that somewhere safe leave it to cool down completely then it will be time to eat it so my caramel has completely set I left it for quite a few hours until it was really firm and now all I need to do is chop it into bite-sized pieces because I don't think I can handle a piece this big so I've got a very sharp knife and I've already cut some pieces of greaseproof paper and I'm gonna wrap them up so I can give them away [Music] this is going to make quite a lot of caramel so it's very important to share at this point but also you can try putting these in say a blondie for a sort of yummy chocolatey caramel chew a bit and also don't forget I've got a really great recipe for chewy salted caramel cookies and you can

me look smarter smarter sophisticated are they Warby Parker they are Warby Parker and I haven't you - I have to give them a shout-out it was so easy to go in to do I had to have them once I got them back I had to have them adjusted yep they did it and I think they work they look great they're really more for reading so here's all the time they can be but they don't have to be because then I can pop in you know contacts do you wear them just to look smarter - no I wear them - sometimes hide the bags on the under eye Oh smart I'm like or do you actually have to use them to see oh no III need to see I need to say I can't say oh you can mmm no really but my son tells me that he doesn't like them okay cuz I looked more like a superhero without them oh I think you're very superhero-ish with them it's more of like the Clark Kent I yeah I know but he really wasn't feeling that story that's so cute though it was real rats - you and your Warby Parker's welcome to the club to you as well I'm gonna take them off for the show though cuz they keep reflecting speaking of things being reflected in shiny and that's a terrible segue but I do want to give a little bit of love to some of our Beauty besties you know we always ask you guys to write to us to share things with us and we did get some love from one woman was Samia I hope I'm pronouncing that right she's actually also a journalist and a pop culture writer and her website is the Samia life so she gave us some love Ryan she was like I love you so we're gonna give her a little love back and then also AJ and Archie who I bumped into on the street and apparently Archie listens to all of these Beauty podcasts and I hope she will add our Beauty to her that big fan of the beauty stuff so just a reminder to everybody if you've got questions you want us to ask if you've got topics you want us to explore write us Hello at art beauty podcast and we'll try to get to that and today and proof of that we had another writer write in who has just been diagnosed with psoriasis and asked us to look into some homeopathic or non traditional non pharmaceutical treatments and you know we know CBD now is kind of like the Wild West I feel like do you yes it is the Wild West but I think we've navigated some real direct paths to LA get some to land in some good places and some safe places yeah I'm excited today we've got um Boronia from mellow daily and she's got a CBD company and I actually met her at this event and was blown away by her knowledge full disclosure when I asked her to come on to our show she said I will not come on to talk about CBD for beauty because in her opinion there just wasn't enough research behind it that said when I wrote her and said hey we've got somebody who we want to talk about psoriasis skin conditions like rosacea do you feel prepared to come on and talk about that and she said oh absolutely so let's hear what she has to say you guys do we look at lighting I was just saying that my web browser was like what say your web browser to remember what it was it wasn't disorganized it was unstable you were unstable I was like Oh web browser you have no idea how unstable I really am so yes seriously unsavory web browser you need to take CBD okay I've got her to a couple times and you know what happened Ryan guess who came and stole my CBD mother my mother came and stole my CBD and Boronia I've been waiting to talk to you because I remember we met at live tonic and you were giving out samples of that little like caramel chew that's amazing I wasn't the best I know those are the ones that I want to order and I had to ask you did you say those have like a little bit of THC in them too or allowed to say that yeah yeah you are but they actually don't have any taste oh okay nevermind okay yeah they're broad spectrum so broad spectrum products don't have any THC in them and the reason that we did that is because we also ship them to the UK internationally so so and then the ones that do are called full spectrum yes that's correct yeah anything with THC in it it's called the full spectrum product and anything without THC is broad spectrum and then anything that is just pure CBD is an isolate question for you so are you illegally uh art not you but our company's legally allowed to sell things with THC in them yeah most about products have THC mm oh maybe I was remembering okay yeah so if you go to our website pretty much I would say I would say 90% of the products on our website have THC in them okay and so that's why we are considered a full spectrum branched but and the reason you can do that is because as of December of 2018 if it's him derived cannabinoids that have less than 0.03 percent THC it's a hundred percent legal as opposed to marijuana yes so have the cannabis cannabis being a mother plant and then you have marijuana and your camp got it and if it's marijuana even if it's not if it's a marijuana derived product product that has less than 0.03 percent THC technically that should be illegal because of the verbage like the verbage is very specific and it says him okay so I think has to be have derived when we first met you I had asked you to come on to talk about beauty and CBD Moody and you said you really didn't want to do that because you didn't feel there was enough research behind it correct yeah yeah and I still stand behind them well can you tell it like so so tell me what your thoughts are on that well so in a nutshell the way that I say Beauty I'm obsessed with beauty so I do all the beauty products I love vitamin A I love vitamin C I do a little Botox touch-up you know I'm all about using active ingredients okay so when people come to me and say to me do you think that cannabinoids are good for my skin my answer or that is well they are but they're not anti-aging they're not going to help you with the things that you're probably going to beauty products for and so I encourage people just to save their money and actually shop on businesses of shop from businesses that have products with the active ingredients in them because there's not enough science support the fact that cannabinoids being CBD CBN CBG or THC have any effect on the skin's surface so and that's applied to anti-aging when you when you think about anything to do with abrasions or bites or burns yes cannabinoids can be very good for that because cannabinoids can get into the sub dermal layer of your skin if you haven't cut but when you're applying it on the surface and you're thinking about using it as an anti-aging treatment I would say don't do that save your money and buy something else gotcha and then we had a we had one of our listeners right in and and so the reason that you are here today is that somebody was asking a viewer share or a listener shared with us a listener slash viewers shared with us that they had recently been diagnosed with psoriasis and then a lot of the traditional pharmaceutical treatments were kind of scary some of the had a lot of side effects and they wrote and said hey can you look into the use of CBD the problem being is that a lot of doctors aren't as knowledgeable about it yet again because it means this sort of new field and they were asking if there was suggestions on whether or not CBD is good for things like psoriasis and maybe what the dosing would be and if you have any anecdotal or evidence or examples that you gave us sure so I am a big proponent of that I think that eczema psoriasis any kind of aesthetic any kind of thing that's inflammatory is very good when you treat it with cat it when is very well treated with cannabinoids and the reason that is is because our body in all facets likes to operate from a place of balance and when we're out of balance we get inflammation and the physiological response to that is eczema psoriasis IBS all of those things and so there's a lot of scientific studies that show that cannabinoids with inflammation so you can make that correlation my concern with that though from a scientific perspective is it's not a cause and effect so there's not real studies that say if the future if you have psoriasis treat it with cannabinoids there's no concrete studies that have proven that yet so really you're right it's all down to a doc total evidence and I mean in my opinion if you use it consistently over a period of time they have been some instances with small studies so there was a study done I think it was in Italy and then I was also study done recently in the UK where it was treating psoriasis directly and there were some patients that had reported that the singing and the itch that you get that immediate stay an itch is actually um lessened within like five to ten minutes of using a cannabinoid oil or I can either do a balm so that's a really positive result right but it's not a result that pharmaceutical companies or scientists or doctors are jumping on yeah but I think we can certainly use that anecdotal eminence and I think if there's customers out there who have psoriasis and they've been given that prognosis by they're just on the doctors gonna say I do need to use steroid medication or you need to use an anti-inflammatory medication which I think can be really scary so I would recommend doing that but doing that in a minor way and then putting on top of that I can a binoy treatment and I think that that and the studies that show that pumping down on that kind of um treatment is actually working and there are a lot of reports showing that it's very good for that because it's an inflammation I have very sensitive skin I am just like like I just flare up with all the things for me even after the halo amber I had that remember that one patch under the eye that just kind of didn't go away and I had done some like V beam lasers to it and finally the esthetician at like the doctor's office is like honey you have um eczema there that's like doctor it's not going away under laser I was like oh she goes if you go home and put like cortisone on it just for like tonight and see if it changes its eczema and then I over the holidays got really stressed out and then right in the temples of both sides I had a little rat a little breakout a little flare unloaded another patch and sure enough I put CBD every day for like six days seven days it's pretty much gone you know I want to ask you is there is there a certain kind of when we say I put CBD on it are you talking about a bomb are you talking about an oil does it matter yes it absolutely does oh yeah right so I mean I think that if if your customers are coming and is you know being convinced that CBD is a treatment that they want to look at then I think that they need to look at an oil so a tincture which a teacher is the one that you put under their tongue there's no reason why you can't take a couple of drops of that tincture and put that directly on the psoriasis or the eczema and it will help clear it up or if they don't have a teacher already at home should look at a bomb but one of the things they want to be really careful about when they're trying a bomb is that a lot of the bombs out there are for recovery so like pain so when you're thinking about that there's gonna have menthol in there there's gonna be Annika there's gonna be eucalyptus oil so they need each other look at these added ingredients to make sure that there's nothing else in there that's going to inflame the already kind of soil condition it's funny that you just said that story actually because I'm the same every now and then especially with the change of season I get like a little kind of psoriasis around my head look at my hairline yeah I just have a little bit of my take shot and I just rub it on and it does it actually helps it go away so I use that story early what about Brian what about for my little hair patch so Boronia about a cod we're going on now two months ago I think from stress I lost a patch of hair I don't even see it here mm-hmm thank you sign part but back but back in the beginning of episode where it's not really an active so to speak right what do you say like it's not gonna necessarily regrow your itch go ahead you do it yeah it will chill you the eff out if you put it under your tongue and allow it to regrow back in possibly have you heard of IPL treatment yo yeah okay so that is incredible for hair catches a really good friend of mine at the end of last year he got pneumonia and he had a patch of hair that went away because just all of his stress on his body and I have one of those IPL face masks and we put the face mask on the patch of hair and within a couple of treatments include back wait IPL Oregon I know it's like it's called IPL right it's that high high arch above the red light IPL's intense pulse light and that's generally for hair removal no no no it's like the discoloration the red cap that I used to wear all the time to regrow my hair in the back yeah that's the red light but is that what you're talking about Boronia yeah maybe I'm not maybe it's not called IP outlets let's double check I can quickly google it actually red lights oh but it's the red light yeah it is the red I just bought this on Amazon it was I can last a Korean mosque I think the brand I bought is destiny es ser it's not like a face mask on his head good job girl I mean it was amazing do you know why I actually did that it was totally like out of the blue so too much information but I get chin hairs I mean we also happens with you know hormones and with females and I noticed that when I was using the mask on my face I would start to get more chin hair so it was like oh my god this is so annoying anti-aging which is fantastic when I'm getting more chin hairs so when he was complaining about it I was like run let's put it on your head and see what happens and it worked so I need to get one then aren't they like $1,000 though - 600 I think yeah they're not cheap yeah ok but listen - good work - yeah I mean hello hi us - to be stationary do I have movement but just back to your original question I would not treat that with cannabinoids no and back to our our you know the main point of the topic so when you have a skin inflammation disorder whether it's something that is rosacea or if it's more of an immune thing like psoriasis is there is there dosing that we should be looking for is there you know milligrams that we should be looking for what is your recommendation how often how much I don't I don't have a concrete answer for you on that because everybody's biochemistry is different which basically means that we all react differently to cannabinoids and you'll get this answer from anyone that's knowledgeable about this we really don't know exactly what everybody needs but what I would recommend customers do is they're either gonna buy a bomb or they gonna buy an oil right and I would buy the highest strength that they can get per price that they want to offer that they want to spend I would also encourage them to look for a full-spectrum product an experiment you know like could I put two drinks drops drops on your pinkie if it's an oil and rub it on if it's a bomb do like one smudge and rub it on and do it morning and night for a week or two weeks and see how that works it's healing too fast or it's healing too slow then they can up their dosage accordingly I think in this particular instance because it's a topical what I'm ingesting it so I don't think that they need to like be worried about taking too much I think that they can really give it a good lunch at first should really try and clear it up as quickly as possible and just go from that while we're on that and not to derail this conversation but is there can you like overdose on CBD no I tried behinds like no Brian I had a really bad reaction I did not eat breakfast I was racing to work and I did it to my boss - she didn't eat breakfast and she got like a really bad she got bad information and she was really upset in the back room and I got the new batch cuz I know the person that was making it in her lab she dropped it off for me and I it was a new dropper but I wasn't used to new dropper new product nothing in my stomach full thing full dropper went right into my tongue not like two or three drops like I usually do full dropper no food I needed to go eat a burger I'll just put it at like that what what was the can you can you what was the exact reaction I'm just curious for the business or not I felt stoned and silly and I couldn't I couldn't go I couldn't finish my client I had to prepare cut and I can't believe I'm gonna admit this I'm pretending to cut my fingers I pretended to cut my finger like oh my gosh she's just come I think her with my new scissors I think I just took my entire fingerprint off I sent an assistant over to like finish the haircut and I pretended to go to the emergency room like where I needed stitches hence I'm in the back just stoned and eating a burger oh it was bad it was a definite bag like a quick I couldn't function to do the haircut that's for sure so I listen could it have been the batch could it have been my empty stomach could it have been we you don't know and like you just said everyone is different right and I'm kind of a lightweight like on the scheme of things I'm a lightweight so what is it won't THC isn't that what kind of gives you at least THC in the marijuana isn't that what gets you stoned but this wasn't full spectrum yeah I was actually just gonna ask that because when you you know to answer the question can you overdose on CBD that can have annoyed CBD I've actually I thought that I could say that with with full confidence no that clearly I can't say that because you did so that's really interesting to me I would love to know so much more about that I'd love to know where the product was from I'd love to know all of that information and because it came from that it was it was on the hemp the family yeah and I know like the farm is in Washington they grow it right there they have their own lab it's like kind of the most organic you know situation I could grab tangibly like Andy th say but you don't cry no but it wasn't like a Roomba I was just like silly and unable to function for a little while like I didn't trust myself to go and charge that woman $200 for her haircut when I was done like so but we don't want that you know we have to be careful of that I think because so I take CBD every single day and I mean you know I function when I'm taking my CBD because I have to I get up in the morning and I go to the gym and I do my work and all that jazz but I mean I would be really I'd be like oh my gosh if I'm gonna take this and it's gonna make me do that that would worry me slightly um I think it's probably a very rare case okay never happened again right but how many drops do you feel is in a normal dropper so most drop is over one mil right there were 1 mil drop and in within 1 mil I think you can get about 6 to 12 drops out of that I would you believe I take a full drop at every single morning under my jock but I have a lot of anxiety that I have to kind of do it and so that's the dose that works really well with me and I take a really high strength product - so I'm taking a thousand milligram product so each drop or I take is 33 milligrams of CBD which is quite a high dose and it's a full-spectrum product but that's my body a really good friend of mine can barely take that you know she has to take one to two drops underneath her tongue and that is it you know so I I look I do think that when anyone's trying this kind of thing for the first time you have to go slow and you have to go low so CBD in general and when I when I say CBD really I'm meeting all cannabinoids so I'm meeting CBD C D G C D NN THC because that's a full-spectrum product so cannabinoids in general when you're dosing I think it's super important that you are patient and and do it and and do a diary so when I whenever I'm starting a new product I even will write a diary so I'll put the time they take it I'll put how much I took and I'll kind of make a couple of notes about the feeling that I felt and I'll do that for you know a week to two weeks just so I can get a feel for what this product is doing for me and that that's what helped me find my sweet spot but you do need to be a bit patient with it because the other thing about it is it can take up to 72 hours to work so some instances oh maybe I never having like some sort of a weird delayed who knows maybe yeah well because it's got to do without it's got to do if you think about the endocannabinoid system as a bucket sorry to fly as a bucket of cannabinoids right and when you say : when you're overworked we use those cannabinoids so our socket is deplete it is depleted and depleted and if we're not chopping those up then we're consistently operating from a place we have you know minimal cannabinoids everybody's different so like for example person a may have a full bucket so if they take a big dose they're gonna get what you what happened to you right I just had a full bucket probably not I was showing off yeah so I love the advice go slow go low go low but speaking of low can we generate that's what we doin because you know Ryan's all about dat booty when I met you Boronia you were like going off about the suppositories right we've been talking about the CBD as a tincture I took it as the the the caramels but you have it also as a suppository and you said that that's actually one of the best ways to get your CBD I do tell you I truly I truly believe that so okay so the I'm trying to try to avoid this in the in the most diplomatic way I don't just say it just say it yeah right so basically when you take a suppository it is the second best way to take it other than injecting it directly into your bloodstream right we don't recommend me in lining anything of course of course but so when you when you when you put a suppository inside your bottom your you have a lot of very rich and juicy blood vessels within there so what happens is a simple suppository dissolved and those rich vessels start to absorb it really quickly the other thing about that is is you don't have to it doesn't have to bypass your liver so if you're taking a capsule or an edible or even when you're putting it under your tongue a proportion of it will go through you on the bus your liver has to essentially metabolize it and work to get it to your bloodstream when you put it in your bottom it doesn't have to do that so it happens really quickly and your body doesn't grow as much away so when you're putting it through your GI tract it's thrown away in your esophagus it's thrown away in your stomach it's thrown away in your intestine and then it's thrown away again in your liver so once you put it into your button none of those things happen it goes directly into your bloodstream and you get the full dosage so Ryan I know you said you had done a deep dive of the website which by the way for everybody at home is mellow daily.com that's MEA ll oh no W daily comm and you were really excited because you said you saw the suppositories how many how many did you order so my question to you is this I already had started doing that I already started it I already started putting it there for many reasons as a gay man for recovery for relaxation before it was like before during and after honey so absolutely so at the end of the day thinking about broadening absolutely I love it I love another way for my girlfriend's to transition to anal I'm so excited that way yes birth control let's move on let's not move on because Ryan you brought up an interesting point so for people who are considering you know anal sex is this something that helps to relax not only your nerves about it which you don't want to be clenching tight right but also maybe to actually relax some of the muscle it does yeah 100% so we hold the Miller bottoms because obviously you want to encourage what I mean that's both you know hetero sex like vaginal intercourse or anal intercourse both it's good for both because what's actually happening is this the cannabinoids will relax that area things they will promote blood flow to that area which will help with stimulation they will also help to slow everything down so if you know you have premature ejaculation situations or anything like that it'll actually slow everything down a little bit so it's for various reasons a very good sexual health product and that is why we actually put frankincense in it because frankincense is a natural antibacterial so you know all of that down there can be quite bacterial heavy and so that's why it's a very clean product it's only coconut oil hemp oil and frankincense so you have no problems putting it in either front or back oh you can also put it like into your vagina as well absolutely yeah absolutely it's it forms of lubrication you leave it in for like 10 to 15 minutes you know get get you busy on be the intimate with your partner massage whatever you need to do and then in 10 to 15 minutes later you can play away same day I'm adding him to the bag right put in the bag I did not know this existed until I took the deep dive on your website and I was literally like yes my name is literally using my tincture oh really yes so there's nothing wrong with doing that it would just blow out it wouldn't stay in there well you know be in a position elders it's not my first rodeo but you know I can keep it so the end of the day I would figured it out but now I don't have to it's just like you've made it so easy I'm so easy I cannot wait well keep them in the fridge so that they nice and cold it can be a little bit like whoops-a-daisy when you put them in because it's cold is better cold is better for your muscles intro like to to work it in and start cold is always better are there are there products that stand out you know the suppositories are something that you probably won't find in you know the local store I mean I think I think when you when you Atmel oh and you look at the products that I mean I stand behind all the products that we have on the site truly I think anytime you come to mellow you can trust that our products are completely vetted so we make sure that every single product on the site has third-party blood tests which basically means that you can understand not just the ingredient in the product but you can actually also see the cannabinoid profile so I think that's really important you can trust it we have a report from a third party lab test that says it has this much CBD this much THC all that stuff we also do not have any products that have pesticides or solvents so they really clean so when you're ingesting these things you know that you're not putting anything that's going to carcinogenic to your body I also think it's really important this is the kind of a superficial one but I think they need to be pretty as [ __ ] yeah and you need to be able to leave them on the show you know if you're having visitors you don't want to be like oh my god I've got to put that away you know you want to leave it out it's cute it looks gray I have this up right now so if you're watching you'll see the mellow sea salted CBD caramels and this was the sample that I brought home I took it that night and had the best night's sleep and I said to my husband the next day I'm buying like 18 boxes and he said you better wait and find out if you can OD on it because he's right I wish I could just take one of anything but caramel candy they're delicious and he was like what happens when you eventually eat five which you will but I guess yeah I would say so the caramels to me I think there's such a sophisticated flavor to I don't know if you notice that they've got a very it's almost a rich and indulgent caramel flavor yeah it's not it's not your standard it's they're just berry and luscious it's it's not just a CBD thing it's also the caramel it's like I can't stop eating on myself yeah would you believe I actually tested it once and I ate in an entire box because I wanted to be sure if you put it over there and all that happened was I had a great place oh my gosh if you ever need somebody to test that kind of dessert treat overdoing it you know who to call and I'm sending you a box of these for Valentine's Day because they are delicious and so what else let's see we've got some vapes some oils oh I guess look at this you've got your fav section we do I would say so one of the key products on here that I love is the bombs we actually just featured as well the vendors yesterday and they're a really cute married couple that I just adore and they have such a wonderful story but this is a really interesting product as well because it's very clean it has witch hazel in it which is very soothing to the body so going back to psoriasis this could be a really interesting thing for people who suffer from psoriasis you could put it in the bathtub get in the bath it's got 200 milligrams of CBD in it so it's a very high strength product the other thing that people don't think about is when you bath in CBD it also goes inside your vagina and your bottom so you absorb it there as well and people don't think about that so it's not just the transdermal layer of your skin is absorbing it it's also those areas so this is another product that I think is really good for recovery and healing it can also be a sexytime product you know you could get a little box time with your partner mm-hmm yep I would totally do a suppository drop this in the tub jump in for the 15 15 get it going inside outside and rock and roll in said I loved there was 200 milligrams and not bathroom I've never seen it that high so that's really cool because sometimes when it's like 15 to 30 I'm like how much is that like what are you doing but that really that just set you guys again you set yourselves apart from quite a bit so congratulations really really spectacular site and again if people want to know more about this if they want to try the products themselves you can do that at

and thank you for joining and see quite a lot of familiar faces and also a lot of new ones so hopefully you will um be able to learn something or indeed please in the chat box here um feel free to add your comments as we're talking um it keeps people engaged and maybe you can answer some questions or ask your questions to other people who may be able to answer along the way rather than just waiting to the end on this call with me a couple of introductions for those who don't already know so my name is sam sam fanshawe i'm one of the event directors at uh racing the planet um my colleagues rita zaina and also mary our founder you may well have been in touch with if you haven't been in touch with me on this call also is tony brammer who is a poor deserts club member he's completed all four deserts but he's also a member of the volunteer management team and tony will help to answer any questions in the chat box and post a few links as i'm talking about them um as well as other people were welcome to answer and then we also have andy blow um there you can see him in his precision hydration t-shirt um waving there so he's going to take over the talk about electrolytes as um and management of your hydration as they are experts in that side of things so this is our zoom session um which is about food and electrolytes for 250 kilometer ultras so today's agenda is going to be split into two two parts and then we'll have at the end um a general section to talk about um some frequently asked questions top tips for planning of food and electrolytes and then a 15 minute um hopefully a 15 minute q a if we have time um looking at the agenda here i'm hoping that this is what you are all expecting to to hear so let's get started and talk about the details of food and electrolytes so starting with the basics so food and equipment on a racing the planet equipment list there they're only two items out of 35 however they're such big and important items that we're covering them specifically today without food and without salts or without maintaining your electrolyte level you would not be able to get through a 250 kilometer or 150 file five mile race um as proof that they're so important about half of the weight and volume of your backpack is going to be taken up primarily by food with a with a portion of that being electrolytes so your backpack is likely to be um around 10 kilos or between 8 and 12 kilos so around the 20 pound mark and of that four to five kilos is going to be or likely to be food it's about calories but it's more than just calories which we'll talk about more as we go through this call a couple of tips at the bottom there and we'll cover those more as we go go through summary on this now this is specific to a race in the planet 250 kilometer ultra but most of the ones that are out there are quite similar so the food requirement is a minimum requirement from us is 2 000 calories a day the race is seven days and so you are required to start the race with 14 000 calories plus a meal that you can bring yourself to camp one where we arrive in in buses and then you don't have to run until the next day so you can bring you don't have to be so limited on weight for that however we would recommend that you bring closer to two and a half or three thousand calories a day equivalent so a total of um 17 to 20 calories in total as well as your camp one solely because you want to be able to make sure that you are having plenty of um of calories to keep your energy up to complete the race um but even so 3000 calories a day when you're doing this much exercise is not that much but it it will not replenish everything that you you are expending but it will allow you um to be sure that you are going to have enough energy to clarify at equipment check we will check all of your food that you have and look at the calories and make sure it meets the minimum requirements and for us it's only a requirement to have 14 000 it's simply a hit hint um or suggestion that you consider having a little bit more on the electrolytes front so we say enough for seven days now depending so much on what type of electrolytes you're using how much you sweat and also how much time you intend on spending on the course itself will depend on what that means and we'll come on to that later on on this on this um information session about how to work out what that means for you so very briefly uh our first resource to to put you to the race and plan equipment list and you you can download them um from our website raising the planet.com atacama crossing for example they're all quite similar equipment you can see here that there are 35 items and each item has quite a lot of detail so for the food supply it tells you here how many calories a day that you need and the total number calories that you must have as a minimum to take you here to the page itself it has a lot more detail about the types of the ways to make up those calories so not in as much detail as we're talking about today but just it's a great reference point to go to and then on the electrolyte again it simply says a seven day supply however it goes into details of how to work out um what that would mean again not as much detail as we'll talk about today but giving you an idea so that's a very um simple easy but but important resource that will answer your initial questions on that after this caller when you're looking in the future so breaking going back to food breaking down your minimum 14 000 calories for the 250 kilometers of the race so we generally say think of it if you're if you're thinking in normal life you think breakfast lunch and dinner if you're thinking about it planning for a race think pre-stage which normally would be breakfast but before you actually go on to the i start your your race for the day what we say on the run um maybe you're hiking maybe you're running but the time whilst you're on the course and then at camp which is split into two two um types of of um food or planning one is for the recovery and the second is for you at your dinner taking that one step further where you want to go on this so generally it sounds very vague but everybody is a little different for breakfast we say have as many calories as you can manage um it would be ideal if you could get a thousand calories in before the race starts however that's a lot to get in uh if you're not going to get up in the middle of the night and digest it before you start especially for those who are going to be running versus those who are going to be hiking on the run so whilst you're on a court on the course a good rule of thumb to have is try and have a thousand calories every sorry 100 calories every 30 minutes then when you get back to camp so when you finish your stage looking first of all having something along the lines of a recovery drink which will not have a lot of calories that'll have a lot of the nutrition that you'll need to help you recover and do it all again the next day and then something quick and easy to eat that's a bit more like real food so it could be something like a miso soup or a mashed potato or a ramen noodles or a packet soup of some sort um that's quick and easy to make and to digest and then at camp you want to full on dinner and we would we would recommend always a freeze-dried meal of some sort so it's almost like as close to real meal as you can get this is an example of an expedition foods option but there are obviously other brands out there as well taking that on again one step further so for breakfast if you can get 500 calories in that would that's ideal um someone a lot of the plans i'm surprised that people put in there 800 to 1000 calories which really is great if you can get it in but it's not that easy to do so on the course i put on here an approximation of 1 200 calories so this is based on completing a stage which is normally 40 kilometers or 25 miles in around six hours which is somewhere towards the front of the middle of the pack um but if you're going to be out there for 10 hours then you're looking at 100 calories every 30 minutes you can you can calculate that out in fact i've done a small calculation on the next slide for recovery it's not really about the calories it's really about getting some real food in and getting your body ready to to um to get some some calories in and to just to start the recovery process she probably only could only be talking about say 200 calories and then for dinner um 800 calories i'd like to say minimum again if you can get more in that's great but remember everything that you're eating you're carrying so you've got to compromise on on the calories somewhere i've included snacks in here but not a calorie count because the snacks should all be within one of these other areas most likely they're going to be in the section on the run or on the course making up your 100 calories um you don't want to have snacks in addition to where you're looking at your three separate sections so with this kind of brief example here based on on a six hour time on the course you're looking at around 2700 calories a day remember our minimum per day is 2000 and we were talking about if you can trying to get 2500 or 3000 a day and then taking before i take this one one step further and give you the examples some things to consider when you're making selections of food so i would say don't try to compare to bean at home you can a little bit but not totally but to give an example of that it doesn't matter about if you as long as you can digest it okay nothing wrong with having chicken and rice for breakfast you might normally be used to having toast um and jam but you can't you're not going to be able to replicate toast and jam very easily in the desert so don't feel like you have to always make it like you would at home or like your ideal would be at home ask yourself the question will i eat it after five days in the desert five days half hard running and when it's been in your pack so there's certain things you may love spaghetti bolognese but if you've got spaghetti bolognese for dinner every night after day four you're probably going to be a little less excited by the by the taste of it next question is will the food survive in the desert so a good example of this is is um things that might melt so chocolate would be a great source of energy but in most of the desert races it's going to melt during the day or it's going to be hot during the day so it's not a great um source of food you can get them in little tubs and you can scoop those out and that that does work but then you're also potentially then going to miss some of the calories because you're you can't get them all out as you'd like definitely think about the weight to calorie calorie ratio um but within reason um because you also want to think about food that you like so the highest one of the highest weight calorie ratio foods is olive oil but you don't want to obviously arrive at a race making it simple with um 14 000 calories of olive oil and that's it so you've got the calories but there's no way that you're going to be able to eat that or it's going to work for you on the race so think about the calorie ratio but also think about whether you're going to be able to eat it as i go back to this one will i eat it after five days think about whether you eat it after um day one or in that case after the first mouthful and then really important is how long you will be on the course so when you think about the three sections of food if you're going to be on the course for a long time where you're not going to have access to hot water um to be able to prepare proper meals as you would like and plus the clock keeps ticking so you don't want to spend time having to prep food then you're probably going to want more snacks or easily prepared food and less of the freeze-dried meals although there is some alternatives around that which i'll talk about in a moment so making this all a bit more specific so let's look at breakfast so pre-race some options here could be an expedition foods breakfast it could even be an expedition food supper and this goes back to my my point of saying there's no harm in having macaroni cheese for breakfast you might want a simple oatmeal that you put together yourself at home or you get in in packets maybe an energy bar would work for you for breakfast or perhaps noodles so looking at the calorie and weights it's always interesting to look at a comparison so the first question for you if you're thinking about breakfast what would work for you you might say there's no way i'd have an energy bar for breakfast okay so then rule that out or maybe you think i don't want to have an energy bar every day for breakfast so maybe i will alternate them between the various options i certainly wouldn't recommend if you're having the expedition foods freeze-dried meals having the same meal and the same breakfast every day so for example don't have priority strawberries planned for every single day so you could look at a variety of these but first of all think about what would work for you then look at the calorie to weights as i've done an option for for you here and then look at the calorie-to-weight ratio so if i look at these the highest calories per gram come in at the freeze-dried meals but the some of the energy bars are pretty good the noodles are not that high but you can easily supplement with simple things like parmesan cheese or you could add olive oil a little bit to your noodles and that would hugely add to the calories and you would be able to ingest it because it's part of a mixed meal so these are the kind of calculations you want to think about i always laugh you think you're going to talk about food it's going to be really exciting and everyone's going to think about gourmet meals but when you're when you're talking about planning for a race it always comes down to numbers um but with making sure that it is palatable as well the next thing to look at is the food on the run so starting with um how i what i said to you in terms of how much you're going to want so 100 calories every 30 minutes 200 calories per hour that works out at 800 calories for four hours and the leaders of a race in the planet ultra normally have finished in under four hours finished a normal stage in under four hours um for those of you who are going to be spending longer on the course 1600 calories for eight hours and the cut off time is normally between 10 and 12 hours so to give you an idea of where you're looking at and so if you then break that down for uh the leaders who are there for four hours they're looking at eight servings of 100 calories to consider per day and i'll look at some examples on the next slide if you're looking at a 10 hour time which is normally towards the back of the pack you're looking at 20 100 calorie servings for each stage of the race so breaking this down one step further with some examples of some of the types of foods you might want to have so nuts is a great one and you can see it's got a high calorie to weight ratio i've done this slightly differently where i've looked at 100 grams of each of these and the number of calories you've got and how that relates down into 100 calorie servings now the interesting thing about nuts whilst it's quite high calorie if you're looking this for 100 calories which is one serving you're looking at about 15 grams which is about 10 nuts so bearing in mind you only want this every half an hour but it's very rarely that you would consider just eating 10 peanuts and the question is would that be enough for you or certainly maybe it should only be one of the portions on a day opposed to um every for the entire day just having 20 portions of 10 nuts so mixing it up a little bit because whilst nuts seems appealing when you break it down to how many you're talking about it suddenly doesn't seem very very fulfilling crisps are great they're also high calorie beef jerky is another good one um but as you can see with these ones there's the number um of servings you get in a hundred uh the number of 100 calorie servings you get based on the calorie-to-weight ratio that you're getting you're having to carry more weight in order to get the same calories in um i've put on here as well so energy bars are another one and you would normally not eat an energy bar in one go when it comes to these races because you want to keep the drip feeding of the calories going in so one energy bar let's say it's a cliff bar or a honey stinger or something like that maybe your hundred calories is is a quarter of that bar so you're taking a big bite but every half an hour energy gels are certainly not what i would recommend not definitely not as an only fuel they don't have that many calories and it's normally a quick hit of sugar um that then runs out um soon afterwards so it's good to have a few as a as a to kick-start you but to consider having all just energy gels just imagine how many energy gels you need so let's say you're going to take one every hour so if you're out on the course for eight hours you're talking about eight gels imagine putting those into a pot pouring them out and seeing what it looks like and then imagining that inside your stomach it's not a great way to um fuel yourself for for a long term race however if you have done it before and you like them it works for you then definitely consider it but try it um before doing that first things like perpetuum like a hammer products or other um kind of liquid food or or tablet style food they're pretty good for for a weight calorie ratio they're not as good as say um nuts or crisps um but they they're still pretty good and they're a different way of taking things so a sustained energy or perpetuum you would take as a milkshake i didn't put the figures in here um because they vary so much by um by flavor and also by brand but you get the idea of what we're looking at here i hope very briefly on the recovery post run and my advice would certainly be have a recovery drink and then have something that's quick and easy to eat when you first get into camp now if you are going to be closer to the back of the pack you're probably not going to have that much time between when you get in and when you go to bed so then this becomes the recovery drink is still important but the extra meal becomes less important because you'll probably be ready to go straight for dinner before you go to bed but otherwise something like noodles mashed potatoes soups crisps hot chocolate something like that is great to have so you can just get it quickly and easily when you first get in to allow your body to start that process and then dinner um the easy option is definitely a freeze-dried meal of some sort and i said you can look on the websites for the various different um flavors and macaroni cheese couscous with casein couscous with cajun vegetables um beef stroganoff spaghetti bolognese um often they'll be a lasagna or a pad thai or risotto so choose the flavors that you like and that um and that you think will work for you and then look at the calorie to to weight ratio and see which ones are best and keep her selection in there so you don't just have the same ones and finally make sure you test them before you before you go now normally they come in around either 400 or 500 800 or a thousand calories again it depends on the brand you're getting certainly expedition foods comes in 450 800 and a thousand and which one you're going to have in the evening depends on the rest of the planning that you're having during the during the day so going back to my previous summary of each of these options this basically is everything i've just spoken about summarizing a quick in a quick table with some examples at the bottom there as well so next i'm going to move on to the food to calorie spreadsheets some summarize summary points before i go into the spreadsheets themselves the first one is plan day by day again talking specifically for a race in the planet ultra but most of them are kind of similar is that you've got five big days so if you're racing the planet ultra you arrive at camp on a saturday you sleep at camp on a saturday night and then the race starts on sunday so you've got sunday stage one monday stage two wednesday stage three thursday stage four that's sometimes a long stage which is two stages and then you've got the final stage after that you're basically talking about five or six big days on the long march one of the days will be a rest day where you still need to have calories but you won't be generally won't be out on on the course or at least you would have some time to to rest and would have been going through um the night from the night before you also have a rest day where i said you want to have something but you can think about having maybe slightly less and then you'll also have the final day before you do less than 20 kilometers to the final finish line where you'll then have access to as much food and food as you like and provide food at the finish line and then obviously you're going to be in a place where you can purchase food so something to keep you going for that um that first uh sort of that last run and it's a shorter run but you don't need to plan a full day for that have an idea of your time on course everything i've mentioned if you're splitting your food down into three sections is going to depend on that a little bit and then things to consider which are self-explanatory there so looking at some spreadsheets so any spreadsheet is better than none however this one is only just better than none it is a real life example i can't tell you who it is and they themselves admitted it wasn't a great one and in further races that they did they did it very differently so it does have the food the calories and the weight they were planning to take 19 and uh 19 19 and a half thousand calories with them um and they had got it listed out but not day by day i don't think they packed day by day and they had packed way too much of the wrong types of food because they hadn't thought about when they were going to eat what when so there's an example of one not to use although at least they had one which is better than nothing so here's an example of one using an exhibition foods ration pack option where you're basically having a freeze-dried food meal in the morning one in the evening and then it's got energy bars and and energy gels and the like during the day so the interesting thing about this and i see it quite a lot is especially after stage one that they've got um the higher calories for breakfast so 800 calories for breakfast again i said it's great if you can um stomach that but it's it's quite um difficult for a lot of people to get 800 calories in and still feel fit and well and ready to run based on this you're talking about 14 000 calories but you can see what they've done each day is they've put out what they're going to eat they put in the weight and then they put in the the calories in there as well and based on pretty much just the right amount you're allowed to have you're talking about three and a half um kilos of weight um and with this because there's no real food when you're on the run you're probably going to want to supplement it a little bit and it would take the calories and unfortunately also the weight up here is one of my favorite examples of a spreadsheet so i'm going to send this out when i send the notes to you as a template is something that you can look at but it's broken it down by a breakfast dinner hopefully you can see the top of my screen there but also by food that's on the run and then they've broken it down by calories and by weight and they've looked at what the total amount is um at the at the end so they have got the detail but not um but thinking thinking of all the different types of food that they might have so here this one was a 15 and a half thousand uh calorie menu and that weight of everything together was going to be 3.7 um kilos and now here is an extremely complicated one which i'm not going to go into a lot of details in but if you want it then please email me separately to info racingtheplanet.com and i'm happy to send it to you but it's just giving you an example of how much detail some people go into when they're looking at it they what i do like is they put broken it down to calories per serving so they're looking at the weight ratio so then when you're looking at the end you can see if there's anything that has a very um low calorie-to-weight ratio i.e you don't get many calories out of something that's quite heavy um then you can consider changing it now maybe it's your favorite food and it's going to be your treat food in which case bringing it but it gives you a way to look at to look at that side of things so on a call like this unfortunately i don't have time to talk through each of these ones in great detail but i wanted to show you some examples of what people put together and i said i will send a link to a sample one which will be the previous one this one that you can use with your planning or base your planning around something like that to give you an idea of how it works so as a quick summary on the food calories spreadshirt spreadsheets so the highlights from there so you don't have to have an equal number of calories per day the long march which is a long stage normally around 80 kilometers or 50 miles and you have more than 24 hours to complete it so some people will finish it in seven or eight hours and some people will be going the next day 24 hours or more you can break that down into two state as if food-wise as if it's two stages and where there is an overnight checkpoint at a race in the planet ultra there would be hot water provided where you can make a meal and you're allowed to rest and the cut-off times would be extended so it's almost like you're planning for two days for that one long stage or you can simply plan it as one longer day where you have a few more calories because you've got more checkpoints more time along the way big highlight is considering your time on the course and hopefully i've drilled that in enough so far as to why that's important obviously it's only an estimate so you also always need to think about what happens if that doesn't go to plan and you end up spending more time on the course and you're left with freeze-dried meals that you don't have the hot water to prepare it with and how you would manage that 14 000 calories for the full race is the absolute minimum that you have just that you can start with snacks are very important but within reason because a lot of snacks can be end up weighing a lot more when you're just throwing them in afterwards so make sure they're part of your plan when you have the snacks in there um and consider not counting calories in the electrolytes that you have um andy can can give his opinion on this when he starts talking about the electrolyte side of things but some some electrolytes don't have any calories so noon for example doesn't have any some have a lot um tailwind for example has quite a lot um but it's a lot heavier as well but if you're not counting your calories it means you've got a little bit excess in there for those that have electrolytes that have some calories in so it gives you a little bit extra buffer however from our point of view when we're checking your kit to make sure that everything's meeting the regulations you are allowed to count your calories that are in your electrolytes and recovery as well and i think it's my final point on the the um the calories are on the on the food side of things here is just some quick tips for packing and reducing weight so my first thing would be to remove the packaging and most freeze dry especially from freeze-dried meals but also from some others um most of them have packaging that you can pour hot water directly into which means that they're a little bit sturdier um if you're gonna have two per day for let's say six or seven days so then you're talking about 12 or 14 of these so 12 or 14 of these packages that could actually be a ziploc bag so that will reduce your weight it's not going to half the weight of your food but it's going to reduce your weight considerably um by quite a few hundred grams i've put them in ziploc bags and they also then will fold down a lot more so here we've got an 800 calorie meal where it will look probably half that again if you remove it from its packaging of course you do need to consider what you're going to eat it out of because you generally won't be able to put the hot water into your ziploc bag and there are some that do allow that but it's going to be not not all of them do so you must check so maybe consider taking one lightweight bowl that you'll rinse and use for every day um you need to pack day by day um so that you can see from the previous photo i have here how most people do it so these guys haven't decanted their remove their packaging which is also interesting to see they're always real live photos but they have put them into stage by stage packs so that they know what they've got and they put their calories on there to help them and also the equipment check um a little tip on here if you're looking to reduce weight increase calories is take a small bottle of olive oil definitely take plastic because it's lighter and won't break and you can top it up into some of your meals that will add some calories in some cases it will add flavor in some cases you won't taste it so perhaps not adding it to your porridge but most of the savory meals that would work quite well parmesan cheese and some chorizo or fatty meat that kind of stuff also works quite well to add calories um but those two are a little heavier and have less calories and finally on here do not add extras just because you can so if you've got a space left in your bag don't just throw in an extra couple of bags of jelly babies because everything that you add in that's not part of your plan you there's a high chance you won't eat and it will definitely add weight so it's like adding a brick to your backpack for no reason um and then just a quick note here as a as a reminder what we spoke about so total weight of food probably going to be between four and five um kilos apologies for those working in pounds and ounces i should have that but i don't um to hand but you can look look that up um i'm sure someone in the chat maybe you can just put that in there so the weight of the food for each of the days is going to be around 750 grams so on that note i know it's extremely fast and i and i've gone over time but i'm going to hand over to um to andy to talk about electrolytes and why they're so important and such so andy if you want to just unmute yourself and um talk me through your talk us through your slides and let me know when you need to go to the next one well thank you sam thanks for the invite to talk to everyone um yeah so electrolytes that you've seen they're on the essential kit list and what are they um why do we need them i won't dwell on this first part for too long but just to explain electrolytes i'm sure you've all heard the term electrolytes are just electrically charged minerals and compounds that dissolved into your body's fluids and they they are crucial for the optimum and healthy performance of the body you'll have heard names like sodium calcium potassium magnesium they're all examples and we get these things largely from what we fit from our food and drink and the crucial thing about electrolytes is that they all operate within a pretty narrow band of homeostasis so they they're kept at levels that keep your body functioning properly lots of different ways muscle contraction nerve impulses the way that your heart works fluid balance all of these things are controlled by electrolyte levels so the the bottom line is they're critical that's why they're on on the list and that's that's why our body needs them next one please what we're going to do though when i'm talking about electrolytes for athletes is focusing predominantly on one and that's sodium so the reason we do that is because not because sodium is more important per se but it's because it's the one that matters to athletes when we're doing a lot of sweating so in the body you've got different reserves of fluid you've got intracellular fluid which is locked inside the cells as the name suggests and you've got extracellular fluid which is outside the cells your blood constitutes part of your extracellular fluid and in the intracellular compartment the main electrolyte that we've got is potassium and outside of the cells in the extracellular compartment is sodium and when we sweat the fluid that we sweat out comes from our blood plasma so it's very sodium heavy so we tend to lose way way more sodium than any other electrolyte when we sweat and that's what drives an elevated need for sodium in athletes who are doing silly things like running 250 kilometers in the desert over several days so if sodium balance gets out of whack it can lead you in a lot it can lead to a lot of trouble and this is something i know about firsthand i've ended up in in the medical tent with a condition that i'm going to talk about in a moment of low sodium levels caused by excessive sweating and ineffective replacement of my hydration levels so it is something it's not something to be scared of but it's something to be aware of and it's it's probably the main reason why racing the planet have electrolyte supplements on the the kit list is because they don't want you to go down with hyponatremia in an event and neither do you so next slide please the the main reason that most people get hyponatremia especially in in life outside of athletics but probably in athletics as well is over drinking fluids particularly water or any fluids that are low in sodium because when you consume lots and lots of water you you can consume it faster than your kidneys can process it out and it has the effect of being absorbed through the gut into the bloodstream diluting the sodium levels and hypernatremia causes then fluid to leach from the from your circulatory system back into your cells to try and preserve the homeostasis at that sodium level and it causes your cells to swell up so sometimes you'll see this in ultra athletes puffy fingers puffy hands um feeling nauseous that kind of thing there's the it's that is a big big sign of hypertension and you can certainly move jump onto that next slide if you if you want some that would be good um hypernatremia is a problem when it when it causes swelling in your brain and the early signs of that are the ones that are later down on my little list there are signs of hyponatremia confusion agitation and potentially muscle cramping as well and i've put a little asterisk by muscle cramping because if you want to create an argument between athletes sports scientists and doctors then you then you talk about electrolytes and cramping but needless to say a lot of cases of of hyponatremia and electrolyte loss is associated with cramping so when you look down that list of of sort of signs none of them stand out necessarily as being particularly you know a red flag that couldn't occur through other reasons during a long hot endurance event so i think um tony's tony said he gets all these symptoms on a night out which you know sounds like it sounds like a good night out tony but that's the interesting thing about hyponatremia is you kind of i had it a couple of times before i realized what it was and johnny's put a little link into a blog on our website which is a good resource if you're interested in reading a little bit more about about signs and symptoms of hyponatremia so when when we come back to this this sort of like the overview of why we're talking about electrolytes while we're talking about hydration for ultra endurance athletes and multi-day athletes what we're trying to do with with hydration status in in an event like this is stave off dehydration which everyone's very aware of dehydration being a you know a big drop in body fluid levels to the point where you don't function very well but also avoid over hydration and dilution of electrolytes and the reason that it's more it's more likely or more possible to happen in a long hot event when you're doing lots of hours of sweating a day is that when you're sweating out salts and sodium and only replacing water or if you if you are only replacing water it becomes easier and easier to dilute your body down and that was something as i said coming back to my own sort of experiences with that that was a big part of what was happening to me i'm a big sweater i lose a lot of salt and i was putting water back in and it wasn't it wasn't just doing the job could slide on to the next one so if you're ready thank you if you take home no other message from this other than the fact that sodium is the important electrolyte to read about on the packets of whatever supplements you're taking the thing to remember is that sodium replacement for ultra athletes is not a one size fits all proposition there's big big differences and those differences between people are driven predominantly by two factors one is your sweat rate so the amount that you sweat and the other one is the concentration of sodium in your sweat now your sweat rate is massively influenced by genetics but it's also going to be influenced by the environment by the clothing that you're wearing by by how long you're out on the course and by how fast you're moving and it's interesting that actually in ultra events sometimes the faster moving athletes can have more of a problem with this than the slower moving athletes because the faster moving athletes can go a very high metabolic rate which really pushes their sweat rates up so although they're on the course for a shorter period of time their sweat rates can be absolutely prodigious if you're walking and hiking you're still going to sweat a lot in the heat but it may be less than some of the faster moving people but sweat rate is a big one and sweat sodium concentration is the one that people are less aware that there's a big inter individual variation of and to put it to put this in your head you know some people can lose as little as 200 milligrams of sodium in every liter or 32 ounces of fluid that they sweat but some people can lose 10 or 11 times that at 2 000 milligrams plus per liter so that's why when sam was mentioning this earlier she was saying it's it's not a one size fits all you know we can't just say take this amount of electrolytes like we can with calories the sodium requirement needs to be tailored a little bit to the individual and we're not talking about getting it to the nearest milligram for you but it's about understanding whether you're someone who's got a low medium high or very high requirement for sodium because the people with the high and the very high requirement who can come unstuck in multi-day events in the heat if they if they don't correct for that so moving on to the next slide do you have high sodium losses so with a precision hydration we do a sweat test it's how i ultimately learn actually that i have a very high sodium loss in my sweat we put some electrodes on your arm take a sweat sample and we can measure how much salt you lose and interestingly that factor is relatively genetic so i must have had hundreds of sweat tests throughout my life now i always come out as losing around or about eighteen hundred milligrams of sodium per liter which is very very high the average is about nine hundred to a thousand and we measure people as low as two or three hundred and you can measure it but if especially given the current situation you can't get somewhere to get your sweat sodium measured or you you you're not in a position to do that then there are signs and symptoms you can look for and some of those are on this slide now so do you have high sodium losses good indicators salt stains on your kit and clothing poor performance in the heat if you if you're generally under performing the heat compared to how you think you would do and the same events in cooler conditions muscle cramps with my favorite little asterisk again because i don't want to get into any fights with anyone craving salty foods that's a huge sign if you have a a big craving for salt after long runs and races that can be a sign that your body's crying out for more sodium if your sweat stings in your eyes or in cuts my sweat if i don't wear a sweatband or a hat when i'm running then i'm virtually blinded on a hot day low blood pressure on standing is a big one if you're because the amount of sodium in your blood helps to keep your blood volume up if your blood sodium levels drop your blood volume tends to contract and then when you go from lying down to standing up really quickly if you feel transiently dizzy that can be a sign that you are losing or you're either losing or have lost quite a bit of sodium a very high sweat rate even if your sweat is not salty per se if you've got an extremely high sweat rate your net sodium losses over many hours are going to be high and what i mentioned at the start is you can always get a sweat sodium test if this is something that you really want to dig into johnny's put a a link in the chat to a blog about in more detail about how to estimate your sweat sodium losses as well next slide if we could sam please planning planning your electrolyte intake for a race now what we've seen some of those lovely spreadsheets before and what i don't want to do is is get people to sort of set on the idea that they need to work this particular part of their regime out to the millimeter it's not about that you could put actually some of this on your spreadsheet if you're building one anyway and look at the sodium content of some of your foods and snacks it would be an interesting exercise but the main thing i think you want to identify in training and preparing for the event is starting to figure out if you're someone who's going to be on the lower end of sodium requirements or on the higher end i learned the hard way through doing ultras and iron man events with only a couple of hundred milligrams of sodium per hour that was that did not cut it for me that was a that was a ticket to the medical tent i needed to take between a thousand and fifteen hundred milligrams of sodium per hour that was racing in order to to maintain my levels and that range is as you can see is pretty broad and i think it's it's a useful exercise to start to identify and quantify the sodium intake that you're having in big training sessions in races what you're taking in your drinks your capsules your chews your gels your real foods excuse me and starting to see you know how you feel with different levels of intake because although although there's there's you know there are ways of working some of this stuff out in the lab your best way of doing it normally like with most things in life is to get out there and have a go and to test and adjust trial and error listen to your body you know when you take a little bit more sodium how does that make you feel when do you take a little bit less and if you've got a few weeks or months before your next event which most people here will have i would say this is a really valuable exercise so that then you can go into the event with some level of knowledge of okay well am i a guy or a girl who needs this low amount of sodium am i moderate or am i high and then you can then you then you can at least prepare accordingly with the electrolytes that you take to sam's point about what types of electrolytes that's very common for people to use the sort of low calorie effervescent tablets for these long ultra events because they're quite efficient on weight we we make a different precision hydration we have a range of different strengths so most commercial electrolyte tablets have somewhere between sort of 200 and 300 milligrams of sodium per per um tab fizzy tablet we make one with 750 milligrams in so it mixes up to 1500 milligrams a liter which is pretty good if you're wanting to maximize the amount of sodium for the minimum amount of weight but there's a whole different range of strengths out there what i would say for sure is whatever electrolytes you're using make sure you read the packet and understand the sodium levels in them because it never ceases to amaze me that some electrolyte products which are relatively popular out there might be high on magnesium or calcium and things which we don't need masses of but they're pretty low on sodium which you could need a lot of so really learn to read those labels and try to know this stuff um at this point and probably jump onto the to the last slide um if this is an incredibly you know superficial dive into the topic and the idea really here is to just introduce you to the ideas of what's important if you're interested in any more information we've got a lot of blogs that johnny's linked to some of them on our website precisionhydration.com you're very welcome to email myself and the team on hello precisionhydration.com and i believe we put together a discount code for people if they want to try any of our products which is just racing the planet so nice and easy to remember to get 15 off an order on precisionhydration.com we we're also obviously here along with sam for the next few minutes to to take your questions my colleague my business partner johnny tai is in in here somewhere and he's going to be jumping in to answer some of them unfortunately i've got a hard stop in about three or four minutes because i've got to jump straight on to a call with some cyclists actually but um yeah if if we fail to answer any of your questions or that today please pick up the conversation with us on email we're a small team we're really passionate about all of this and we would love to hear from you and continue the conversation that's fabulous thank you so much for that andy so just i did a summary of this for um a previous slide and i'm putting them up here so they'll show on the recording some of the examples of the types of electrolytes that andy was talking about and what's the most interesting thing about precision hydration is that they have the different levels of sodium and i definitely if you ever have trouble with your um sodium levels or your exhaustion levels which you think might be related to electrolytes or sodium i would definitely get in touch with precision hydration to find out more other options which are quite popular the noon salt sticks are the types of tablets that you take drip drop is another popular one at our races um again putting this up so you can see it repeating a bit of what andy has said so how many electrolytes that you need to take with you depends on what type of electrolytes you're bringing how long you'll be on the course and how much you sweat or need electrolytes but and the the types of options you've got so we've spoken about it a little bit already so you've got the ones which are like the tablets that dilute in water and we've got the ones which are tablets that you take like a tablet like an aspirin or a paracetamol type thing or better still is a combination of both um because the ones that you dilute in water can also help you to stay hydrated taking in water because the taste of water after a while in the desert can actually um get a little boring so having something with the flavor but equally sometimes it can make you feel a little nauseous and you don't enjoy having that flavor so having the tablets and that you can take as well um is is a is a great option of combinations the only other thing i wanted to touch on on the electrolytes which andy more or less said but just to um say it as well is you really can get into a lot of trouble um with your with your body with with your health of your body if you do not take enough electrolytes hyponatremia is not not a good thing to experience and can come on very um fast and to date and andy if you're still there please correct me if i'm wrong but there is no evidence to prove that taking too much sodium in a race like this because you're limited to really how much you're not going to be down in a um a packet of salt um but taking too much sodium is unlikely to cause you major problems it might make you feel sick and it might not make you feel great but it's not going to um cause the problems that hyponatremia can cause you in terms of of having serious medical um issue whilst you're on the course yeah i would i would agree in the in the spirit of that in that more a bit more sodium rather than a bit less during a period of time when you're doing a hell of a lot of sweating makes a lot of sense from for the majority of people my only the only caveat we always carry out that statement with is that and i'm an athlete myself so i'm not gonna you know throw stones here but we're all a little bit ocd and we if someone tells us that a little bit more is better then where do we where do we stop with that and that's why i think it's it is also important to do a little bit of trial and error it's important to to remember that like anything like you can have too much oxygen you can have too much absolutely anything and i would say look at that that ceiling of around a thousand fifteen hundred milligrams of sodium per hour as being from the experience we've got working with a lot of athletes not very few people need to exceed that especially if you're eating relatively salty um foods like your expedition rations and things tend to have quite a lot of salt in so but i would but i would wholeheartedly agree with with sam's sentiment that a little bit more rather than not enough is the way to go in these things and and test that out before beforehand the this the final thing probably on that is the sim one of the symptoms of far too much apart from feeling sick and nauseous might be over multiple days you'll start to gain weight which would obviously be highly unusual in a in an event like this so i don't know whether there's much weight i know that some races weigh and things like that but if you're just aware that you're sort of starting to get get um puffed up ankles and things like that it can be a sign if you're taking a lot of salt as well but yeah your body's your kidneys are pretty good at filtering out excess sodium if you do overdo it a little bit great so summarizing here talking about some of the resources um that are available and will be useful to you so first the racing implant equipment list or the equipment list from whichever race it is that you're doing exhibition foods when it comes to nutrition they also have a lot of blogs on their website and they're happy to set up a call to discuss the nutrition and nutrition plan that could work for you both with their products and additional products on the side precision hydration um as andy has said and the contact details will be sent out in the notes to talk anything any of your questions about hydration electrolytes and the like and and obviously they um have their own products there as well youtube videos on the racing the planet youtube channel um which i will send the link to ironically the tag is for deserts race series um but there's two particular videos that um up there are going to be up there and then i'll send the links to one is carlos garcia a four deserts club member who is also um a course director for us now has done a video on specifics of food so this is more about the general side and he's doing some about exactly what a day looks like and his specific food options and michael williams who's done a number of our races and is set to do the four deserts grand slam when it goes ahead um has done a lot of experimentation with food and he's just started a youtube series which is really interesting the more you listen to the more idea that you'll get because there is no one-size-fits-all for everybody um or that's not the ideal way to do it so listening to the different information people have for you on the racingtheplanet.com website there's also an expert article section i think i've spoken about it before but it's got articles on training articles on equipment articles on clothing it's also got a nutrition area there as well and then alumni veterans part of our community our past races everybody loves to talk about it i've shared some of the spreadsheets from some of them with you both the good and the bad and the complicated ones but if you know anybody who would like to be in touch with anyone who's previous previously done one of our races i'd be more than happy to put you in contact um with certain people in certain areas and finally not as much as with equipment but the photos on the website they are interesting to see especially when they're at checkpoints at camps and you'll see what other people have and how they're how they're um when where they're eating what they're eating how they're carrying it etc finally a summary of some of the tips um of this final summary of what we've spoken about today and some key tips one is start to think about how long you plan to be on the course and considering how your food and electrolytes would work for you each day when you're ready and actually planning for a race put together a spreadsheet and you can base it on the templates that i will send you or you can put together your own you can understand the logic behind it and start considering the types of food that would work work for you test all food and all electrolytes in advance in your training um when you are packing take foods out of its original containers in order to save space and weight quick note on that don't do it until you get to the country of the race it just makes getting through customs easier um and also you you can decant it before you get to your uh race check-in certainly with racing the planet uh we're pretty used to knowing roughly what calories are in in most of the foods but we may ask you to explain what it is so make sure you know what it is or label it um things that you can top up um for calories that are not that heavy and can add flavor and all calories olive oil parmesan cheese and and fatty meats chorizo for example um and in food take a mixture of salt and sweet foods because you never know what it is you're you're you're going to want and the final one which i haven't put on here um relating to to the topic that andy has been talking about is one a few things i think one is to check that the sodium levels on whatever electrolytes it is you're going to take do meet the requirement that you have plan to have a mixture of tablets and and powder or a tablet that you dilute in water so you've got a mixture of options with the electrolytes and in your planning plan to have slightly more rather than slightly less because if you spend more time on the course you're likely to need a little more electrolytes and you don't have to take everything you have but if you run out of electrolytes you will struggle to continue the race so my final final slide next steps for you so assuming that you've decided what race you're going to do and you're all step and you're all set to to start with your planning first thing think about your approximate time on stage even if you keep it as generic as do you want top 10 middle the pack or just to finish slash back of the pack start a spreadsheet template in a template format that you like whether you create or use an existing one think about what foods could work for you in the four different categories or the three categories one of which split into two research the options of makes and models of items including freeze-dried meals energy bars snacks liquid food and and look at calorie-to-weight what's available and what you think that you would like and with the electrolytes start researching early starting with what do you use now and could you switch what you use now to have in a mix of the diluting tablets and the actual tablets and i should add on to that thinking start thinking about how much you sweat and how much sodium you actually think that you need and certainly contact precision hydration if you are unsure how to start on that so if you have any questions please unmute yourself and uh ask away and if we've confused john here i've got a question sorry i can't get them buttoned um yeah rubbish uh all this packaging it's going to create a lot of rubbish or do we have to carry that with us i'm a newbie so i don't know so no on a racing their planet um ultron i know there's some people on here looking at others so there's um bins at every checkpoint and there's bins at camp and you can throw away everything there they are very heavy penalties if you are caught um leaving anything on the course or if you leave your tents dirty um or full of rubbish um but there are places where you can throw it away your mandatory equipment you have to keep with you you can't throw any of that away but something like socks you could for example also throw away a pair of socks if they're used and you've still got enough for the rest of the race and on your calories your food if you really have got too much and actually too much over the amount and you don't want to carry on with it you should be giving it to our management team and we'll give it to the local teams there who are from the countries we're in if they want it to supplement for what they have rather than giving it all to your tent mates um again it's not allowed to give it to your tent mates um and i know it does happen and certainly if it's people in the top 20 then we we would be quite very strict on that but in terms of the packaging you're talking about there's places to throw it away as long as you throw it in the correct places you don't have to carry it out just one point on packaging john you can't you can't bring uh disposable spoons and forks and plates so uh because we don't want to generate waste just by people bringing disposable products all right tony yep wouldn't do that okay thanks i have a question sam it's nikki hi nikki um hi uh do you do you provide a meal the first night in the desert before the race starts i know other races do we don't um we used to um but we decided that we're safer not to just for fear of people getting food poisoning or the like when you're providing local food so we don't however we drive to camp one and uh this is the benefit of being on one of these calls we don't always openly say it but we drive to camp one and you stay the night there and then you don't race until the next day so you don't have to have a freeze-dried meal that night maybe you want to go to the in the local host town and take a pizza with you or a sandwich or something nice that you won't have or some fruit that you won't be able to get for the rest of the week so we don't provide a meal you have to bring that meal on top of your 14 000 calories maybe it's a freeze-dried meal or maybe it's something um more real food from from where we've come from great thank you and there's a little extra tip on that if you were thinking through it you could consider that for breakfast the first morning because you're also not having to carry that but that would be included in your 14 000 calories yeah okay brilliant thanks any other questions just one point from me sam that uh people who are trying new electrolytes or new food like expedition foods or food that they wouldn't normally consume it's better to try them and test them when you're distressed so after you've been on a long training session if you've run a marathon then try eating them try doing it not at your kitchen table when you've got nothing else to do and they don't taste the same as they do heated and you don't feel very well trying to get down an 800 calorie meal or something that you don't normally eat is quite difficult yeah and you'll find that some things taste amazing when you're testing them and awful on the course and vice versa so make sure you have that variety there i got one comment sam is howard how you doing hi howard after each stage i've been pretty happy with having a recovery drink before i get into my real food and getting recovery drinks in your body within the first half hour after running the stage is gold your body processes it you get a jolt of protein some carbohydrates there's all kinds of them out there and i would suggest you test them out but i think that is real important especially for hard training days but using that uh at the race was golden for me thank goodness howard we agree and it was i have already mentioned that but that's good it's good to reiterate it to know it's true and i i hundred percent um back that that yeah sorry i was late no that's brilliant whilst we're waiting chris chris gooch i'm going to just ask you if there's anything that you've got as a top tip to share with everyone um top tip don't do what i do um that's about all i can say we need a bit more specifics on that what wouldn't you do well the first the first time i attempted anything and and ended up crashing out in namibia that was uh i didn't have enough food on the course basically didn't get enough nutrition as as i was making my way through the course that's definitely a big thing i mean i know you've emphasized it a lot think about your time on the course and make sure you've got enough um for me i would say that's the single biggest thing to concentrate and make sure that you get right and actually that's quite quite an interesting and important point it said it's easy to make up your calories just by having so if you had two 1000 calorie packs of exhibition foods that's your 2000 calories a day but it really doesn't taste very good or is that great for you if it doesn't have water in it now you can make them cold and eat them cold but they're not definitely not as nice um so thinking of things that if you were going to be longer on the course and you were planning having enough food that you can have on the course um if you if you aren't able to get to hot water um as early as you thought that you were going to to get to it so because those snacks or those that food from the course you can always eat when you're back at camp as well so don't just go with snacks but up in that that ratio if you're unsure about how long you might be on the course is definitely a a good a good tip any other questions brilliant good so on that note just to um summarize where we are from here so i said everyone who has um rsvp'd and we have their email or has put their email on the zoom then i will send the notes to tomorrow and also links um and a couple of attachments for some of the resources that we have spoken about it also will include the discount code that precision hydration are offering if you're interested in going down that route and also expedition foods are giving a 15 discount as well for everybody who's been on these calls from now until the end of the year or everyone who's um registered for a race in the planets ultra and then there's a final note here so we've been having these monthly zoom calls so far it's been about preparing for the race the next one is actually going to be about the last desert in antarctica which is our our um 250 kilometer race there we always get a lot of questions because it's a slightly different format so it'll be about antarctica and the logistics and how that race specifically works and that is planned at the moment for the 11th of april um in case you are interested in finding out more about that otherwise on that note i'm going to um close off the meeting and say thank you very much for for attending and it's been really great to have you all here i hope you've learned something and uh i hope to meet you in person one day one day soon thanks sam thanks tony and now thanks for watching thank you thank you thank you he's in the middle of his david goblin i'm here now you are how how's your how's your four on four on 48 going doing very well i got two more to go only two more to go only two more to go wow hold on hold on i was going to do it but it's too cold here at the moment uh yeah i had my share of freezing rain on two of my segments but it's pretty nice today it's probably in the mid-40s not raining today i'm going to do it in the summer when we've got longer days you can always do it you'll be fine anybody's always interested david goggins challenge four four miles every four hours for 48 hours is that right how is it great that's correct yeah so challenge of a different type but quite interesting to follow and two more to go you look way too good sprightly ah yeah it's the it's the mental training at 4am that's the kicker that's that's the that's where you really learn what your body feels like and what your what your where your motivation is so uh if anything you get out of it those those two 4 a.m uh moments are are worth a lot everything else is howard what's harder 250 kilometers across the desert or this challenge 250 across the desert it's harder this is like a easy training run this is not taxing um now yeah yeah a long day on a on a racing the planet that'll that that that'll uh make you look inside and figure out what you're really made of interesting it's good to hear yeah stay hard howard and uh ken how how is your training going you've been posting some beautiful pictures it's a bit stub start this weather just with uh with the various covert restrictions but um yeah getting the odd good tracking and uh working my way towards georgia which is looking hopeful at the moment so yeah i know brilliant good for you yeah yeah no it's it's it's great and these these monthly calls are superb and that was a fabulous one tonight really appreciate that really good okay good i'm glad um that's glad it's helpful certainly having precision hydration on here as well was talked about all sorts of things that i certainly couldn't couldn't go into that much detail on no no it's really good thank you very much appreciate all that brilliant ken take care stay safe yeah johnny go for it just just whilst i'm still here if anyone's got any hydration questions and hasn't asked them or you know with such a big group then i posted a link in the chat we're very happy for people to book individual calls to either talk through their plan strategy that they've mapped out based on this evening's chat or obviously we can answer any specific questions so very happy to do that if it's useful um from here but thanks for having us this evening thank you very much for being here said you've um said a lot of things that i wouldn't have been able to and that's brilliant i'll send out in the in the email notes that i send to people um a summary of the of the chat and also some of the links there um and i i think that you'll probably find people would take take you up on it i think a lot of the information given about the electrolytes and the sodium was uh quite in-depth and certainly boggled uh some of us a little bit you don't think about it so much but once digested i'm sure people will um if there's any specific questions or any kind of practical stuff that that wants to be chatted about then very happy people to book calls with us yeah one question i have for you johnny that maybe will interest anyone who's still on the call is so when you do the sweat test so you have to do it in person do you there's no way of like sending a sample or yes with our sweat test you do it in person we've got we've got various sweat test centers across the world we have around 65 centers you can go to globally but given the different restrictions at the moment with covid it's often not easy to do that the blog that i posted earlier um is worth a read to sort of get a rough gauge on on what your losses are likely to be like but we also have an online sweat test which is a um a 10 a 10 question questionnaire and everyone who's had our sort of proper test has answered those questions and we can we tailor that to give you an idea of whether your losses are going to be in you know the low moderate high or very high buckets that andy was talking about and that can give you a gauge on roughly where you need to be yeah so you can do you can do a virtual test but posting samples um is quite tricky because any evaporative loss of fluid when you're moving samples around leads to huge changes in in results so we've we've tried to steer clear of doing any mail away samples and things like that because it's from our experience with auditing that sort of stuff the error is is quite substantial it's good to know that you have locations outside of the uk though do you have some in the in the us and also in asia yes we have a lot in the u.s um i can i can dig out a link in a moment and post it in the chat for where you can find that but you'll find it on our website in the footer there's a tool you can click through to find where your closest one is we have a few across in in asia but not not so many um we have one somebody's just sent me a message about products in south africa and testing in south africa we do have products available um if you it's it's actually not best to order through our websites in in south africa because shipping from from the uk to south africa is is not ideal but we have a distributor there who i can i can link you up with david so i'll sort that out but we have products on the ground in the us um three warehouses in the us one in canada one in australia one in the uk so we've got pretty global coverage with all that kind of stuff if you have one in israel that was one of the questions we don't have a test center in israel no but we can ship product there i know a few customers that we have over there so yeah we can do that sorry i missed that one okay unless anyone else has any specific questions and i'm gonna um close off the meeting but thank you very much all for being here and really enjoyed it and for bridging hydration for being here and uh hope to meet you all in person one day soon bye thank you", "flO8_8QgZes": "place city family what is up it is art and Bobby back in the grocery store to do a video all about buying pork beef chicken and ground turkey at the grocery store because I think there needs to be a little bit of education there's a lot of choices here in the chill chest not all of them are good and I want you guys buying the best quality beef and chicken and stuff to put in your body before we get started this video is sponsored by a longtime supporter of the channel thrive market thrive market is fantastic because any all-natural organic non GMO stuff you normally get at a grocery store like this you can get off the right market for up to thirty percent cheaper plus you don't have to leave your house a box comes to your door which considering it's getting pretty cold in Chicago comes in handy they have this new thing called the price scanner on their app where I can walk around the grocery store scan products no tell me if it's on thrive market for cheaper or if they don't have it no suggest something different it's fantastic but thrive market now has some of the best pasture raised pork grass-fed beef and chicken that I've ever seen before I'm gonna tell you more about it as we go along but if you click the link in my description box down below you can get a year-long membership to thrive market with a twenty dollar shopping credit if you don't like thrive market after 30 days you can cancel you get to keep the shopping credit but I think you're gonna love it especially the pork on there because I've been crushing the bacon that is unbelievable I'll tell you more about that in a second let's start with pork come on over here buying pork at any grocery store is really in my opinion perilous why because all the pork in the grocery store is traditional factory farmed pork that eats a strict diet of GMO soy and grain it's kind of crazy pork is not getting any love y'all right chicken we can get organic chicken we can get non-gmo chicken beef we can get organic and grass-fed chicken we can't get anything remotely like that when it comes to pork so what do I mean I pick up these guys right here these are boneless pork chops I actually love these because see all that fat that's marbling fat is flavor just like a steak this is really good see this ground pork right here I love cooking with ground pork because 80/20 beef to fat ratio this is very fatty and juicy very hard to overcook or dry out the problem is this is all fed GMO corn and soy we talk about this all the time when you have a strict feed of GMO corn and soy not only is the nutritional profile worse than grass-fed or pasture raised GMOs are just not something you want to put in your body I would never eat GMO pork meat or dairy so that's strike number one but also strike number two is when you're talking about this kind of pork it's traditionally the factory farmed kind of pork that never goes outside for the pasture raised only eats a strict diet of grain and when you talk about factory farming and you see those pictures of like polluted lakes and streams with all like the poop and stuff like that it's from factory farming when you're talking about pasture raised that never happens so if I pick up the sausages here right you think it would just be sausages and seasonings but I turn it around here when I look at the ingredients right here corn syrup GMO corn syrup more salt a more sugar natural flavorings natural flavorings and nasty preservatives so that's not the kind of stuff you want to see in pork and it gets you actually gets even scarier if you come over here for a second the bacon all the bacon at the grocery store is usually factory farmed strict GMO feed never free to forage the best you can maybe do here at a grocery store like this would be an Oscar Mayer select because it doesn't have a lot of the nasty phosphates it actually has a clean ingredient list which is nice but once again it's a strict GMO feed and this is factory farmed pork so maybe we talked about it before if you can get Applegate that's great let's go back over here because thrive market now works with a pork farm in Georgia called a white oak pasture it's a family-run farm it's a hundred percent pasture raised the pigs get a supplemental feed get this of pasteurized eggs and peanuts because sometimes the eggs are cracked on the hatch it's free to for do they eat acorns they eat grass it's non-gmo it is the best quality stuff when you click my link in the description box it'll take you to the pork bundle you get bacon you get pork chops you get Boston but you get ground pork and it's some of the best quality best tasting pork you'll ever see so check that out it's worth the membership alone let's talk next about something that doesn't get enough love ground turkey I love ground turkey because sometimes they get bored of chicken you want to mix it up the thing is there's a couple buying principles about ground turkey right you look at something like this this is a congenial ground turkey nowhere does it say organic nowhere does it say certified humane so the thing about ground turkey or turkey farming in general it can be a pretty dirty business just like chicken farming can shove a ton of turkeys into a turkey house can be pretty inhumane never go outside the feed is pretty bad so you want to ideally buy ground organic turkey I don't see that here at Walmart but the best you can do is something like this this is harvest land premium meaning it's an all vegetarian diet and no animal by-products I'm going to talk about that with the chickens in a minute when it says no animal by-products it actually is important because the stuff they feed chickens and turkeys can be horrific like poop and sewage right you don't want that here's the interesting thing art and I always talk about so come in here so you can get ground turkey breasts like this but it's 98% lean to 2% fat or you can get something like this right ground turkey but it doesn't say thigh but it is a mix of mostly thigh and breast look at the color right can we do a little side-by-side this is a little darker and you can see more fat this is so lean that's like beaming I would highly recommend staying away from turkey breasts it has no fat 2% fat the odds of you overcooking this are a hundred percent so even though it doesn't say it and I can't find it anywhere it will always be just a generic ground turkey and so look for that try to find organic but you're always gonna see rosemary extract in there and the reason they do that is not just for flavor it's a natural preservative there are a couple people like I used to buy ground turkey at Trader Joe's but they used rosemary natural flavors so I switched over to getting its costco actually but look for organic ground turkey thigh or just ground turkey and compare the color it's really really easy you don't want that breast meat it's way too lean it's gonna overcook when it comes to chicken you always want to buy the organic it's really important we have a whole video just about chicken and i don't want to spoil that video you can watch it afterwards organic and this seal of USDA Organic really means a lot some people don't put a lot of weight behind it to be USDA Organic means a lot if you break the rules you'll have serious punishment the reason why you want organic chicken at least is because it has a non GMO feed right chickens always eat grain exclusively unless it's pasture raised chicken so if you're gonna eat grain you want them to be non GMO corn and soy if it's organic it also says all vegetarians feed no animal by-products and it says free-range free-range the marketing gimmick that means nothing these chickens still never go outside but these two things mean a lot to me because all vegetarians feed diet what does that mean well sometimes they feed it animal by-products and other parts of animals ground up into the feed and when you see no animal by-products and vegetarian feed that means they don't put poop yes a lot of times in mass chicken farming that but poop in there and you don't want that chicken farming is very very bad that can put 35,000 birds in a hen house so unless it is organic or certified humane it's gonna be really bad conditions now I wish this one here was certified humane it's not but at least it's organic so get organic chicken try to find pasture raised chicken that's even better I always say life is too short to eat regular chicken because it's just treated really poorly and the diet is really poorly and the nutritional profile it's not better for you so you don't want to put that kind of stuff in your body alright let's move on to beef all right last but not least let's talk about the beef you guys know how I feel about the beef it's all about grass-fed because if you're talking about conventional beef it's kind of like this same thing as pork this can be factory farm to beef that only eats a diet of GMO grain and not pasture-raised I mean the the essence or the beauty of pasture-raised grass-fed beef is that it's a hundred percent pasture race so when these cattle here are out in the pasture it's doing a huge benefit to the environment why because they're mowing the grass and pruning it they're also stamping water wells down into the ground so water from rain can get in there too it's better for the farmer because they're not in a mass feedlot and it's better for you that's most important right how is it better for you grass-fed beef has higher omega-3 fatty acids and higher conjugated linoleic acids very very good so even though it's a little more expensive your body drives more nutrition from it so they actually have one of the better grass-fed beef selections here at Walmart because if you look at the ground beef here check this out they have an 80/20 blend and it's funny cuz look at the price on that it's 548 and it's more expensive 598 for the 90/10 so you're actually paying more for leaner beef I'd much rather pay less for more fat cuz fat is flavor because with grass-fed beef it tends to dry out a little quicker because it's more lean so you want that extra fat a thrive market also has fantastic grass-fed beef 100% grass-fed from Chile so make sure you check that out on their website also in addition to getting the pork bundle which I highly recommend the organic grass-fed Yee from thrive market is the best gift ever had if you make a steak or ground beef or ground pork in that gear unbelievable they'll also have organic Graham ground beef here that's grass-fed in this case there's a really no difference you don't have to pay more because they're both no edit hormones or antibiotics so it really is not a difference here now art saw this out of the corner of our eye these big packs right here right this is the kind of me that would not buy but it's 73 percent lean if they had this in grass-fed that would be amazing but this is once again that factory farmed beef that is GMO fed not high quality at all you just don't want that you really want the grass-fed beef and then look at this I just saw this out of the corner of my eye they now have beyond burgers here the price is really good you guys I think it normally is like six or seven dollars in other grocery stores and this is the new version the 2.0 and there then we try to get marbling in there so they put cocoa butter and it actually cleaned up the ingredients and they got rid of a couple bad ones that we talked about in the video from last year or from a few months ago and now it's just natural flavors is the only bad one but for what it is it's actually not bad it's a meat substitute burger so it's right it's right under the sign I just pointed out right here for 100% all beef not so much so you really want to get grass-fed beef it tastes fantastic and it's better for you so that is it between pork ground turkey ground chicken and beef you know what to look for use my promo link for thrive market down in the description box for the pork it is second to none you're gonna love it and when you're at the grocery store take a look around you really want to buy the grass-fed the organic and makes a huge difference you guys so like subscibe screw hair or in someone's way right here luckily at the end of the video we got two more videos going below us right now but art and I will see you very soon until then hashtag keep on cooking mad love and peace", "V7zGNyetIQk": "today i'm going to take a step back and answer a very important question what is digital marketing then i'll go into the different types of digital marketing and for those of you that stay until the end then you will also be able to see an inc 5000 company use digital marketing with actual examples so what is digital marketing digital marketing is the least expensive and most effective way to grow a business is a fraction of the cost of traditional marketing is the fastest way to interact with your customers it's the most targeted form of advertising available it's a great way to build trust and build your brand and it's quite literally the most measurable and scalable form of marketing available hi everyone is sherman at life marketing the number one agency for small business marketing if you don't want to miss out on any information that can help you grow your business then i'd advise you go ahead and hit that subscribe button below today i'm going to take a step back and answer a very important question what is digital marketing then i'll go into the different types of digital marketing and for those of you that stay until the end then you will also be able to see an inc 5000 company use digital marketing with actual examples all right so what is digital marketing digital marketing is marketing through the internet and by marketing we are referring to the set of activities that's used to create communicate and deliver value to your customers so by using digital marketing you're effectively doing this through the internet so that's what digital marketing is but why should you use digital marketing here are the benefits of digital marketing in five words it's fast interactive inexpensive targeted and measurable and if i'm being honest it does all five of these things way better than traditional marketing like seriously what do you think is faster cold calling 100 people or sending 100 text messages and emails and how do you even interact with a radio ad anyway is that even possible meanwhile your customers can interact with you directly through social media advertisements in regards to cost a tv ad will cost you about 20 dollars to reach 1 000 people meanwhile social media marketing will cut that cost in half to reach the same audience and look the targeting is not even comparable not only can you target by demographics behaviors and specific geographics but you can also target custom audiences custom audiences like audiences of people who recently visited your website or contacted your business and last thing here and we'll move on digital marketing is measurable you can quantify your results once tracking is installed on your website you'll be able to see conversion data on your website and then you can take a step back and determine what's working what's not and ultimately scale your business so by now you should know the what and why of digital marketing now let's talk about the how in order to understand how digital marketing works you need to first understand the different types of digital marketing here are the six types of digital marketing your website first and foremost search engine optimization content marketing pay-per-click or ppc advertising social media marketing and email marketing now while these are six different types of digital marketing they actually work best when they're used in synergy with each other with that said let's walk through a digital marketing campaign together so you can fully understand what digital marketing is all right so for this example we're going to be taking a look at kaitu life super coffee which was just founded in 2015 and has grown by over 11 000 in the last three years to rank in the number 18 spot on the inc 5000 list and in case you're wondering i've never heard of them i picked this example randomly so that i can show you how digital marketing works and how you can take away these things to grow your business so let's go ahead and look at their digital marketing to see how they achieve such massive growth all right number one their website the first thing you will find is that they have an amazing website design it clearly shows their product what makes it unique and even includes some customer testimonials in order to be successful at digital marketing you must have an effective website your website is the centerpiece of all of your marketing so in other words if you have a crappy website then you will probably have crappy results even from the best digital marketing campaigns by the way if you're enjoying this video so far then please help me out by smashing that thumbs up button for me below all right number two search engine optimization once your website is set up the next logical step is to invest into search engine optimization which is also referred to as seo you will want to make sure that people can find your website when they're looking for it and based on what i can find kaitu is ranking for over 1800 keywords and generating over 40 000 visitors for free from google for example they rank number one for the keyword super coffee in google now this one keyword gets searched over 27 000 times per month in just the us alone and because they have optimized their website correctly for this search term they show up first on google's organic search results this means that they're getting thousands of traffic for free from google and all this is accomplished through seo seo is the process of improving and optimizing your website to rank higher in the search engine results number three content marketing the next big piece of digital marketing is content marketing content marketing will help you generate trust once people find your business now content marketing is all about creating value you basically want to provide free information that guides people closer to buying your products this can be done through blogging ebooks videos and so much more now let's take a look at kaitu kaitu uses content marketing to answer frequently asked questions that their customers likely have during their buyers journey number four ppc advertising content marketing and seo is very effective but it takes a lot of time to work so to speed things up a little bit you might throw in some ppc advertising ppc advertising is a fast way to drive traffic to your website except that traffic normally comes at a cost ppc which stands for pay per click refers to paying for every click on your digital advertisements these type of ads are most commonly used on search engines when we discussed seo i discussed that kaitu ranks number one for super coffee organically in the search results here we can also see that they run ppc advertisements on the same search phrase they have a paid ad that appears at the top of the phrase in an organic listing that appears below the ads so basically whenever someone searches for super coffee they are dominating the search results number five social media marketing social media marketing is a great way to build awareness and trust while directly interacting with your target audience it basically consists of creating and publishing small pieces of content on a consistent basis this content should inform inspire or entertain your audience and in order for it to work you need to make sure it reaches your audience and kaitu's instagram page is certainly not lacking this they have over 75 000 followers as a result of them consistently posting content that not only reflects who they are but who their customers are as well number six email marketing with all these digital marketing activities in motion you'll likely start generating traffic to your website in no time this is good but to maximize your revenue you may need to push your hottest leads just a little bit to get them to pull out their credit cards and ultimately buy from you and that's where email marketing comes into play email marketing is perfect for staying in front of interested leads or previous customers on a consistent basis which is why there's no surprise that kaitu is offering 25 off their products to acquire the email addresses of people who subscribe to their email list and while i'm not on their email list i'd imagine they're sending a bunch of emails to educate their subscribers and promote their products alright so that's what digital marketing is all about now let's go ahead and recap today's episode today we answered the big question what is digital marketing digital marketing is marketing through the internet why should you use digital marketing well because it's fast interactive inexpensive targeted and measurable and then lastly we discussed the different types of digital marketing using kaitu as an example the different types were website design seo

be doing some like reviews and thoughts and share some things that I really like either it's like clothing for food or drains or a technology granted I don't get paid making any of these videos because I couldn't care less so it's not really a plug but I've had this name in my head like a just go and then you know if you know me I'm stubborn when I want to do something I want to do something so he's shameless plug so let's get right into it today I got a package from my protein super mega thanks for that that they've launched a new product that I'm really really really right interest they smell so good by the way it's the coffee boost so it's not just coffee boost it's not like anything Adam just makes a really fancy for some reason but yeah so this is one of their pro range my protein Pro the coffee boost so it's like an instant coffee powder um it's got a hundred fifty milligrams of caffeine a hundred and fifty milligrams of caffeine for one serving and 75 milligrams of dynamite so I've no idea what that is but since it's they put it in there I'm gonna assume not asked it for you so if you're interested google it and let me know leave the comment and below what the hell was dynamite I don't know what it is I'm sorry everyone um so they sent me the mocha flavor I love their mocha flavor protein powder so I can only imagine how good this is gonna be so this is like 30 servings in here literally like no fat no calorie no ill sorry 5 calories per serving no protein less than 1 grams of carbs so everyone knows I'm doing true meaning so this is perfect for me and I'm a huge coffee junk like I drink too like venti sized Starbucks a day minimum not really for the caffeine just like for the bitterness of the kind of cap like coffee it just tastes good you know and if you have some like almond milk or regular milk whatever you prefer it's just awesome so we're the further ado let's get right into it come come with me so I boil some water I'm just gonna make sure that it's still hard looks is still hot right so yeah I don't have a like the water how do you even say that a pot so I have like cuz I'd like a coffee machine right here so I don't really need that so if you're judging me about how I'm gonna do my instant coffee with the pot water whatever alright so let's get right into it alright so let's open this up man like this thing smells so good first of all my protein what the hell what's the scoop don't have to dick into this oh it's right here okay well they're not doing too bad alright I'll let you off the hook it's right on top all right oh this smells so good so sets to put one and a half level scoop I think is what is this right 1.5 level scoop so this is about 1.5 man it smells so good right so let's pull some water I don't know how this is gonna go oh it works oh wow yo this this looks great this reminds me one of those one of the scenes and friends where Joey and Ross got bullying and they had to drink instant coffee like this looks legit like looks really good ready for taste all right guys moment of truth let's see how good this is what was hot Wow yo it's actually it's actually really good um I like it doesn't taste the same as just like drip coffee obviously like if you're someone fancy that has like an espresso or your Starbucks person that's not the same I'm gonna be honest but this is better than any instant coffee I've ever had like this is really really good like it tastes like coffee like hundred percent there's no like powdery and stuff like that it just it's all all you can see it oh I'm gonna pour it there we go yeah so yeah and there are a couple things that I usually like to do when I'm like drinking coffee like doing intermittent fasting so I'll put like almond milk which is unsweetened so it's like 30 calories per like serving and whatever so like it's good for interment fasting and if you're someone who likes a little swing right in your coffee this is godson so my protein zero calorie flavor a drop so the Stowe toffee one so usually I'll put like a tiny little drop cuz it's super super concentrate so it's super I wouldn't say it's super sweet but it's full of flavors so yeah put some flavor drops in there microwave this is the pro tip microwave your milk or your almond milk look at that it's still steaming if you can still see it yeah like dude if you don't have a steamer or whatever it's called like you know to steam your milk just put it in a microwave like 45 seconds and then print your coffee that's it it's like the best drink ever like the coffee boost the best coffee everybody yeah anyway so I hope you guys enjoy it I personally don't recommend things that I don't enjoy or I don't like um like I said I don't get paid by you know making videos like this so I'm just gonna be honest with you I like it or I don't write but so for the coffee I really enjoyed it so if you're interested to pick up any products from my protein make sure to use the link down below I'm into this description box that just basically helps me to tell my protein that I send you over there so that the product that sent me didn't go to waste that's kind of it and and use my code well VIP you get at least forty to forty five percent off at least depends on either you're in the US or Canada or UK all of them you get at least forty to forty five percent off so yeah there you go I'm gonna go back and dry my coffee see ya", "pVxg2pOEC9o": "hey guys what's up welcome back to my channel or if you're new here hello welcome my name is Jennifer today I'm sharing with you guys some crock pot meals that I have filmed over the course of the last couple months this all wasn't in a week as you will see it's a ton of different pork ideas there are a couple chicken in there too but I love doing pork in the crock pot so you will see there are a lot of variations of pork that I do in the crock pot but they are super easy and super delicious and I've just recorded them over time and then put them all together so that you can get a few different crock pot meals in one video so I hope you guys enjoy this video and get some ideas from it so let's go ahead and jump into it alright guys so here I am just throwing in some country style bone-in pork ribs that I got you will see a theme throughout this video that I absolutely love to cook pork in the crock pot I think it just makes it super tender and falling apart and you could put a bunch of different sauces on it and make it your own which is what I love to do which you'll see throughout this video but these are the country-style ribs with the bone-in which give an amazing flavor and here I'm just dumping all my seasonings on which is garlic powder Adobe and minced onion which I kind of add on everything and then I am also going to add this G Hughes sugar-free Hickory barbecue sauce which I absolutely love all the G hues they are keto friendly and sugar-free and they taste phenomenal and then I am going to pop it on low for probably about 8 hours or so and then I will show you when it's all ready alright and to go with these barbecue country style pork ribs I just cut up a head of cauliflower and I have it here boiling and then I am making some of these seasoned southern style mix greens that are absolutely delicious and I have just a couple tablespoons of butter in there and then I'm going to add some garlic and sour cream and cheese and butter and stuff to the cauliflower mash and mash that up and then I'll show you when everything's all plated up alright and there is the barbecue ribs out of the crock-pot they are super tender and falling apart then the cauliflower mash I just added sour cream cheese garlic parsley salt and pepper and then there's southern style mixed greens and we are ready to eat okay so tonight's dinner is super easy I'm just gonna dump all of this in the crock-pot and let it cook on low for four to six hours I'm making like a cutified brown sugar glaze to go on top I'm missing one item that I normally add in there with which are minced onion it just gives it like a good texture on the top but I'm going to add them in in a little bit after I stop the store and grab some so I will show you guys that then but I have some chicken thighs here as well as some chicken tenderloins that's what I had on hand so that's what I'm using I'm gonna throw that in and then I'm gonna make like a little glaze here and just dump it on top avocado oil [Music] okay so I've covered all of the chicken with the sauce and like I said I'm just gonna put it on low for four to six hours I'll check it at four and see how it's looking all right so the chicken is all done in the crock pot I'm getting ready to pull it out but I'm just making up my fried cauliflower rice right here and just letting these eggs cook in the middle for a second then I'm gonna break them up in there and I have salt pepper garlic parsley and some of the soy sauce which this is what I use the Bragg's Liquid aminos and then I have some Brussels sprouts on the side and I'll show you when I have everything plated all right and here's dinner all plated up this cauliflower rice I just added the garlic parsley and a fried egg in there you could add carrots in there if you want to but I did it today and then I just have some Brussels sprouts here and that's the chicken out of the crock-pot it's super crispy on the top but falling apart super easy and quick dinner all right guys tonight's dumping go crockpot meal is a little bit different because I am just showing you what I do to prepare for two different dinners they have these twin packs of boneless pork tenderloins always for a really good deal at all these and I am going to throw them in the crock-pot and cook them on low for eight hours and I'm just gonna add these seasonings that you see here and nothing else that way when they are done then I can take one of the tenderloins chop it up mix it with barbecue sauce and have that for a dinner with some coleslaw which is what I'm doing tonight and the other tenderloin I will put up it will already be fully cooked and I can either make it like a teriyaki glaze for it or I can make it a lemon pepper tenderloin and that way I'll knock out two dinners and one night so I'm gonna throw these in the crock-pot with some seasoning and then I will show you when they are all ready and as you can see I just got both tenderloins in there and they are really good side so they'll make the perfect amount for to dinner and now I have all the seasonings on them and I am just going to put this on low for 8 hours and let this cook all day and the seasonings that I put on it are just like the basic ones that I usually add to all my needles this is the Goya adobo all-purpose seasoning minced pepper salt garlic powder and then some of this keto Chophouse which I just added the rest and to the crock-pot so I'll show you when all of this is done cooking okay so this has been on for seven and a half hours and they are done Oh steamin they are both done got some crispy edges there and I'm gonna pull one out and put it up in the fridge and it's up aware for another night and the other one I am going to add this sugar-free Hickory barbecue sauce for tonight's dinner all right so I've shredded this one all up and put some barbecue sauce in with it and here's the other one that I am just letting cool it is super tender and falling apart I'm just gonna let this one cool and then I'm gonna put it in a Tupperware for another night and so super easy to dinners knocked out alright so here's the dinner that I made with tonight's pork loin I just mix the barbecue sauce with it like I told you earlier then we had some cauliflower mac and cheese baked leftover so I just reheated some of that and I made some sugar-free coleslaw which I've shown on the channel a bunch of times so I'll try to find one of those videos and link them down below but that is going to be dinner tonight and then that is the pork that is left over from the other tenderloin that will be another night's dinner for tonight's correct pot meal we are going to be making a loaded chicken and cauliflower soup it's got all kinds of awesome ingredients in it it's not like super complicated or anything just prep everything and throw it all in the crock-pot and you're good to go so I have a pack of chicken breasts here and I'm going to use this whole pack it is a little over a pound as well as some boneless skinless chicken thighs and I'm gonna throw this whole pack in there as well and then I'm going to use I'm not sure how much if I'll use both of these for every one chicken stock and one chicken broth if I'll use both the full containers or what we'll see as I add stuff in but probably use both of those and then I have an onion some carrots and celery and then I have two bags of frozen cauliflower you could use fresh cauliflower if you want to but just to make it simple because I have a super busy week this week I'm just going to toss those in there and then salt pepper garlic powder and Italian seasoning and then after all that cooks for a little bit then I'm going to add the cheese and the heavy cream in closer to the end and then I'm also going to fry up a little bit of this bacon and add it in as well so I'll show you how I put all this together I have all the chicken and the crock-pot and I've already added all the seasonings now I'm going to take my container of chicken stock here and just pour that right in all right added a little more seasoning with those veggies and I'm just gonna kind of toss those around a little bit and then I'm going to add the other container of chicken broth and then I'm just gonna add a little bit of this crumbled bacon that I just cooked up and then I'm gonna put it on low and let it cook for about six to eight hours alright guys so I've added about a half a cup or so of heavy whipping cream here maybe a little more I just guesstimate pour it in there till the colour looks right and then I added a block of sharp cheddar cheese that I shredded up and then just let it go for like another hour so and it will be good to go and I'll show you when I played it all the loaded chicken and cauliflower soup already and it's smelling delicious and I made some southern keto cookbook cornbread here I just pulled it out of the oven and we are getting ready to eat dinner alright guys super quick dinner here I have this center-cut pork loin that I got I posted it my last grocery hoff you guys didn't see that I will link it down below but this is just gonna be super quick I'm just throwing this pork loin right in the crock-pot and then I'm going to cover it with this complete seasoning which I absolutely and a bunch of these chopped onions and some of this G Hughes honey mustard dipping sauce which only has one net card per serving and then some of this coconut own oil grass-fed ghee and that's it I'm gonna let it cook on high probably about six hours or so and then I will show you when it's all ready all right guys here I have the pork loin all covered with a layer of that honey dipping sauce and then a layer of those onions and some seasoning the pork loin is massive as you can see it takes up almost the whole crock pot so those onions will make a super crunchy topping on the top and I'll show you when it's also the pork tenderloin is all done it is super tender and falling apart I just pulled some out here to make up my plate and I just have some southern style green beans here on the side and some cauliflower mash that I had leftover so I just heated them up real quick there's some butter on them and that is what I'm going to be having for dinner tonight all right guys so that does it for this video I hope you guys got some new ideas or some different variations to do pork ribs or boneless pork tenderloins which I absolutely love doing they make always a ton of leftovers and you can do so many different things to them as you saw so I hope you guys try some of these out let me know down the comments below which one that you want to try or different variations that you do for different crock-pot meals I would love to hear from you guys and if you're not following me on Instagram of course as always make sure that you check me out over there at in

just had one a second ago and have to have another one it is I mean just like first and foremost like really good and covered in salt big crunchy sea salt and the caramel is so soft oh man I'll put the top back on these things by the way man there's a mess of your diet but I'm here to tell you I mean the caramel is so creamy that is a true statement this was the softest creamiest caramel some of these things are caramels it's way too chewy damnit hats off to a Sanders candy company that is the best that is the absolute best of this type of product that I've ever had and not only have I reviewed plenty of such things but beyond that just eaten plenty of such things in my life I'm here to tell you make of all the snappers and the turtles and other things where it's just the same thing as the cube of caramel covered in dark chocolate and sea salt that's the best chocolate creamiest caramel and the most amount and consistent amount of just overloaded with salt - this is the winner for this this this product category this type of of treat this type of chocolate this type of confection it is the absolute 100% best I've ever had I'm just the most sincere review I think I've ever done to say that I can recommend this product a hundred percent if you like this type of stuff go get some of these I'm not sponsored by this company but bought these right off the shelf from Costco I have no interest in giving that glowing recommendation other than it is the freaking best that I've ever had like that absolute thumbs up do me a favor hit thumbs up on the video to subscribe and all that good stuff too but most importantly if you are within driving distance of a Costco I recommend that you get in your car and go get some of these things it's they're amazing anyway later", "ddw6mRnlOIc": "[Music] you hey kids it's going postal I thought you might enjoy a chance to see what it is that I like to eat and the things I like to drink and the things that I found a snack on I hope that you are enjoying a trip into a low carb land and that you're making it as easy for yourself as you can for starters let's start with bone broth bone broth is extremely healing for the gut the best brand' well one of the most popular brands is kettle and fire you can find it almost everywhere actually Albertsons and and Fred Meyer carry it for sure and I believe Walmart does too they carry both bone broth and the soups especially Fred Meyer carries more of the soups than any place that I found and they come in multiple flavors both the bone broth and the soups and I found them to be pretty amazing bone broth is really good for gut healing and for well it's acceptable while you're fasting tastes just like broth mostly I like the chicken and mushroom the best really nice way to intake some liquid and some sodium while you're fasting and gives you some flavor break next it'd be avocados so very good for you anti-cancer properties lots of magnesium and potassium and avocado actually has more potassium than a banana and if you spread a little bit of what's called no salt it's a salt substitute on it when you eat it that is pure potassium and will help you reach your potassium goals for the day so next we would have spinach for high fiber leafy greens with high potassium and high magnesium lots of vitamins excellent for you gives you a good chance to use some high-quality dressings to get your fat intake up next we have asparagus you grill some of this up with some garlic and throw a little bit of lemon on it that's just amazing right there then we've got my cereal I have a whole video about how this is made about two videos back this is really good for you it has flax seed which reduces your blood sugar it has chia seed which is full of omega-3s it's got coconut which has MCT oils in it and heavy cream for the fat no sweeteners and it tastes really good I enjoy a bowl of this as often as I can don't forget to throw on the cereal some cinnamon cinnamon is also good for your blood Sugar's and all-around health used to be used as a medicine back in the day then I've got eggs over-medium I do love a good egg over-medium and I have a video that's coming on how I do my eggs over-medium to help out anybody who's new at frying eggs the pan actually is one of the most important parts as far as I'm concerned if you want to cook a good egg over-medium eggs are full of fat and protein wonderful for you next we've got salmon salmon that you buy in a can is always wild caught because farm-raised salmon will not keep in a can so they don't can it excellent source of animal omega-3s and protein and it's actually better for you than tuna next up we have homemade mayonnaise homemade will be much better for you than store-bought because you control the ingredients and you only put the best quality ingredients like avocado oil into it I have a video up about two videos back on how to make homemade mayonnaise and you will find that it tastes as good or better than the store-bought and you can put flavorings in it I think herbs and whatnot this is a bowl of salmon salad that I made with homemade mayonnaise and it was fantastic one of the things I like to do because I find it to be very tasty and very simple is to get a roasted chicken from Walmart or Fred Meyer just pull the meat off the bones throw it in a pile toss it into a ziploc throw it in the fridge now you've got precooked meat that you can pull out and anytime during the week and it's amazing and I like to get out on the grill and grill me up some bacon same kind of a process just kick it all up chunk it up throw it in a bag it's a block bag throw it in the fridge and you've got chunked up bacon I'm ready to use at a moment's notice next up we have coffee I love love love this Dunkin Donuts caramel coffee cake coffee it is so good it doesn't require any creamers or sweeteners in it it's just awesome did you know coffee will also drop your blood Sugar's I get about an eleven point drop in my blood sugars after I drink coffee I like to put a little bit of MCT oil in my coffee it gives me a nice healthy shot of fat and helps me with my brain activity during the day helps me stay on focus for my work and then we follow that up with a little bit of cinnamon in my coffee yes cinnamon right straight into the coffee and MCT oil it has a little kick to it that's pretty nice does tend to sink to the bottom though so watch that now let's talk about snacks a bit let's talk about start with what's known as the fat bomb there are a lot of different companies choices flavors etc of fat bombs they're a little nice little snack help you not be hungry next up we've got Philadelphia Cream Cheese in the flavored variety oh my gosh the jalapeno is so good I am flat addicted to the jalapeno there are multiple flavors this is the savory collection here and here comes the sweet collection I tried to stay away from the sweet ones just because they are a little higher in carb and I am a sucker for sweet I just am I can't stop once I started on it so I tend to stick with the jalapeno and more than anything drinks I love the buy drinks they come in so many different flavors and they are really tasty they're sweetened with erythritol which is one of the most acceptable non sugar sweeteners out there next up we've got Blue Diamond almonds in so many flavors these things again they're a little too good I have to really watch myself and try to limit myself my favorites are the salt and vinegar followed by the wasabi followed by the dark chocolate followed by the habanero so many flavors really good for you but a little high in carbs so you have to be able to limit yourself next step we've got teacher Rene's also known as pork rinds if you're like me you're not really a fan of regular pork rinds they're just not enough flavor there this brand raises the bar these are really good but they are extremely spending if you like me and you occasionally just have to have a piece of toast with your eggs this brand and this version right here is a good acceptable low carb bread don't spend the $30 for three loaves on the internet for low carb bread this bread right here is available everywhere super cheap and it's only one carb or two carbs per slice more than the expensive stuff on the internet looking at the nutrition facts you see that it's two slices of bread per serving with 19 total carbohydrates so you divide that by two you get nine and a half grams of carbohydrate and then you can subtract off the dietary fiber of three leaving you with six grams per slice of bread hey you know it'd be awesome if you could take a moment and leave in the comments your favorite foods and snacks that would be a great help to those starting out in the community thanks for hanging with me today I enjoyed it I hope you did too postal out", "HTOlSPXDsyM": "if I what this I don't know if I put all night okay Oh finite finite if I look like PW to me top look like Peterborough to me to pick up for pick up feel like PW oh yeah sin that bit of you owe to me smell for smell man like GW oh yeah smell like pwo to me to taste Oh taste find scooper don't need that tastes like pee wo ya think I'd be wo a little bit good thing we know step in it young good thing let's go walk out yeah walk out my name is Rick I am so glad that you're here today we're going to be talking about my pre-buy my protein this seems to be a little bit of a stealth pwo so we're gonna get into the details on this cuz it's quite interesting but before we do I'd like to welcome you to the channel if you're looking at getting inspired if you're looking at getting motivated if you're looking to make a better version of yourself well you've come to the right place just click the subscribe button down below and also hit that little bell that way you'll be notified when I upload new content so with that let's get going on my cream let's start with the supplement facts because this is really interesting you know that I have a bone to pick with any type of supplement that uses proprietary ingredients well let me show you something very interesting here I'll turn that around and as you can see that ingredient list is really really big every single ingredient has been listed out on this there is absolutely no proprietary blends in this let's take a look at what's in it I'm not going to read the whole thing just hit a couple highlights what I will do is put the ingredients up there so then you can read along with me and let's start with it's 50 calories with only one gram of carbohydrates and boy this is getting tough to read you're going to notice the first part and there's a lot of vitamins there's thiamine riboflavin niacin vitamin b6 folic acid but if you look at the amounts you're going to notice that it's 11% 12% 11% 10% of the percentage of the RDA recommended intake of vitamins moving down you'll see calcium magnesium chromium sodium so there's yeah you know a lot of different vitamins but the dosage really isn't all that there is in it if you have a decent diet and you're eating cleanly chances are you're not going to need to take a multivitamin so this is a little bit of a benefit but if you are worried about your supplementation your vitamins then this by itself is not enough you want to stick with a good multivitamin in addition to what's here moving down we do have BCAAs and a2 1:1 ratio however it's only 2 grams that's about half the dose of what you would normally want to see same thing with the LSAT your line there's 1.5 grams that two is only half the dosage moving over to the right side you're going to see beta alanine and also d-aspartic acid at 1.5 grams a piece again that's about half the normal dosage here we'll keep moving down to what's interesting is we do have different forms of creatine but looking at 500 1000 and 500 milligrams there you have about 2,000 milligrams or two grams total half the recommended dosage for the day we have a few more ingredients moving on down and let's let's look at the caffeine caffeine we have only 200 milligrams that's about a cup of coffee and then you complete with a few other ingredients including guarana extract which is a hundred milligrams really not enough to get a decent burn on overall what I'm finding in the ingredients they're trying to be all that they can be with all the ingredients that they have here it's kind of interesting but I don't know what you're gonna find is if you decide well I'm gonna take twice the dosage I'm going to do two scoops you're gonna be looking at over about 400 grams of caffeine that's quite a bit that puts you right at the limit so you need to be real careful at this what you could do is go one and a quarter one and a half to give yourself enough caffeine but really at one scoop we need to find out what it's going to do what we'll do before we get into the effects we're going to do the infamous taste and mix ability test so here we go let's open this bad boy up and I have my cup here ah boom so I have my ice and I have my water so let's do that and let's see here let's get a good scoop a good scoop here spit on all right figure on a few flips it is oh what a pretty shade of blue and here we go looking at this it's kind of dark so it's hard to see but if you look carefully you will see some floaters that are quickly sinking and we have quite a bit of sinkers in that yeah there are quite a bit of sinkers you'll notice that there is a little bit of foam on the top and that would be from the BCAAs most likely looks to be artificial coloring and artificial flavor I'm going to assume the flavor that we have here is usually one of my favorites is the blue raspberry flavor I usually try and stick with a couple flavors for example the sour gummy and the blue raspberry that way I can compare them between different companies different type of drinks and it's just flavors that I like so let me refresh my memory ooh here's a a chemical taste is definite chemical taste but the blue raspberry definitely comes through with a little aftertaste now there's there's no grit that I'm sensing on the tongue a little bit of an aftertaste very very slight the flavor I would give it about a 7 7.5 I would classify this as definitely a slurp but you want to put this down pretty quickly rather than just sipping and enjoying it but you know it's let me try again usually I find when I'm drinking that some of the half affects the after flavor disappears that you can enjoy a little bit better but I'm not finding that on this sipping or slurp it slurp it get it down fast alright we're gonna start talking about my workout and before we get into the actual workout let's talk about the effects I I work out at 4:30 in the morning on the base gym and I usually head out at about 4 o'clock in the morning to get out there usually along the drive I start taking the dose and I took this in about 10 minutes I you know as you're driving you can't just go some people can't I can't but I doubt it in about 10 minutes I started feeling the effects of the beta-alanine very lightly some tingles about 15-20 minutes in coming up about 20-25 minutes I definitely felt an energy start to build up it wasn't a super strong energy it wasn't a cracked-out energy but it was a decent energy and I could feel the focus I was starting to be able to concentrate a little bit better I was getting single-minded again not super crazy I've been on some some stems that are just totally totally nuts you know it was okay now bring out the workout sheet you can see that the different workout that I did and I found that I was able to lift pretty strongly I didn't lift max weights but I was able to get through each of my sets right now I'm lifting for volume more than heavy weight just trying to really have a little bit of pressure on my joints and muscles right now as I've been having some issues with them but there you go the actual exercises but let's let's take a look at some of the exercises that I did being that it was a pull day you can see that I did rows so there's an example of some of the cable rows that I I also did curls and this particular curl is called 21 sand with the 21s all start from the bottom go halfway up and do seven reps then I'll do seven full reps and then from the middle to the top I'll do seven more reps and let me tell you something you get a burn when you get to that last set there the idea is to keep my muscles under tension for as long as possible from there I moved over to the lat pulls and just cranked up a number of sets of the lat poles from lap pulls I moved into the hammer curls and worked hammer curls trying to get a little bit heavier weight keeping my hands in a neutral position my goal is to hit my biceps already hit any muscle for that matter in a number of different ways from there I did dumbbell shrugs and you're going to notice that I do use lifting hooks on some of my weights I find that with some of the muscle issues that I have I have pain right along here and with the lifting hooks that helps alleviate the strain I know a lot of people look down on lifting hooks and they also look down on gloves which you'll notice that I wear as well but I have nerve damage in the hands and when I go barehanded and I grip a heavy weight the the pain gets really intense so the extra padding on my gloves helps me a little bit so if you're wondering that's why I wear gloves and on my pull days I will wear lifting hooks now after I did the shrugs I moved over to finish things up and I did reverse pull-ups and that is more of a neutral position again working the biceps in the neutral position versus a wide which will put you out here working the lats in the back and then finally I finished up with my decline sit-ups holding on to a 12 pound ball and I try and do the movement as far as I possibly can and keeping the tension on the abdominal muscles if you are going to notice that I am doing a twist and part of what I'm doing in my workouts is I'm trying to get more mobility in my back you're going to notice a lot of times when I turn I turn my whole body rather than my neck because I have a limited range of motion and if you watch the video of my health story you'll find out a little bit more about that but I do have limited motion and the goal that I'm doing with these exercises in the twist is to get more flexibility and from this I didn't film it but I also do some roller just to crack the back and massage the muscles and everything that's really what I do so that's the workout that's what I did and it wasn't bad at all I didn't have the cracked out energy but I had a good energy that was consistent throughout I did find out about Oh almost an hour the drop off was fairly steep but it wasn't a sudden crash of energy but it was it was stating out I did find however at about an hour and 45 minutes to two hours I crashed I just I felt oh my gosh this wow I it was it was pretty hard I actually had to take another supplement my BCAAs that have a little nootropics in it to bring me back up a little bit but there was a definite crash from the caffeine in this overall I would say that my pre as a stealth pre-workout is not bad definitely good for the novice is sticking with one scoop if you are a little bit above a novice then one and a half scoops is about as far as I go I know the recommended here is one scoop but we all know that a lot of us are totally crazy and we're gonna we're going to do what we're going to do because we're so stint tolerant and we're looking for that extra energy so there you go that is my pre bye my protein you can look down below there's a link to their website and you can get a 25% discount off of all their pricing their prices are very reasonable they have sales a lot of times if you sign up for it and I really like the products that are coming from it in particular because they do put all their dosages on the supplement and in addition to that lab door takes a look at these and rates them and the my pre was actually rated pretty highly on lab door comm saying that what's on the label is what's inside and we know with amino spiking and these proprietary blends we don't really know what we're putting in our bodies now we know and my pre does that if you could take a moment and write some comments below let me know what else you'd like to see I would love to hear from you you'll see that I do have my website listed above there and then I'm also

it's really difficult or impossible to maintain good nutrition for fitness and health while they're traveling well it's possible I think a lot of times when we travel we want to take advantage of all those great meals that we're not gonna get when we're staying at home and just anything wrong with that frequently we gain weight because we're taking in a lot more calories than we normally do I really don't like getting up in the morning ever feel free not ever and I'm not one to get downstairs and try to have a breakfast at a convention or something like that I've learned that I can do something to make sure that I have been interest in the morning to get as much protein in as possible and not to be so grumpy and not have to be social in the morning so these are some of the qualities that I use to have breakfast when I travel as I travel this summer you're going to various the fans I'm going to take photos of how I use these and some other products to have a nutritious and filling breakfast that's healthy these are two products that I normally use the Quaker protein it's an oatmeal it comes and little packets that are easy to carry when you're traveling has 240 calories only one gram of saturated fat 5 grams of fiber and 10 grams of protein the planters nutrition protein makes us 10 grams of protein I'm always chasing protein and calcium and iron it's got peanuts in it protein clusters soy nuts and almonds and I usually don't you don't worry but this is a rare occasion again it has 250 calories 3 grams of saturated fat and 12 grams of sugars so the nutritional labeling a little bit closer detail eating one pack of the cereal and one pack of the nuts it's going to give me about almost 500 calories and it's going to give me 20 grams of protein that's not bad for a breakfast meal in a hotel room or something like that and fairly easy to prepare another option is the 250 calories is going to be too much are these emerald 100 calorie packs they only have 100 calories per pack but it's only going to give you 3 grams of protein so what you're giving up here is 7 grams of protein and you're saving a hundred and fifty calories so that's going to give me 340 calories and 13 grams of protein another option is to take the protein oatmeal and get a quest bar I like the quest bars because they travel well they they don't melt or anything like that and you can prepare the oatmeal and cut up one of these and add it to the oatmeal it's going to give you an additional usually a quest bar it's going to be about 200 calories and give you a 20 grams of protein this particular one has 190 calories and 21 grams of protein so those two together is going to give you under 500 calories for your meal and it's going to provide 31 grams of protein so if you're sticking the protein with fewer calories that's going to be an option and I don't know that the blueberry is going to be the best thing to be compatible with the cranberry almond but you can find compatible flavors you know obviously another option is going to be the best bar this is a coconut cashew which might be a little bit more contained with this this is a quest bar that has 190 calories and 20 grams of protein so they kind of bury but that's going to be a good good option for a warm breakfast in a hotel room I'm preparing my breakfast for a couple of trips that I'm about to take I'm going to be staying in a hotel room and a team room with few amenities so I have disposable cups pack of the oatmeal with the nutrition and spin in each one so that I can put some hot water in there mix the oatmeal and they store the nuts in there so have five of those that gave me a pack of the over leftover so put that in a baggie with a couple of the packs of the almonds and walnuts and this will go in my small carry-on bag make it bad girls like that I put some bolted up pieces of aluminum foil in there if I have leftovers I can take them back to my room and if I can keep them cold in the little ice cooler I can heat them up using the iron or the blow dryer or some other few methods in a nap or sometimes just sitting them in the hot dashboard of the car will work depending on where I am so that's gonna give me six morning meals and for four of these meals then I'm going to stay I'm gonna have to really protein up because I'm gonna be very physically active so I'm taking four discarded olive oil little better bowls and I put a scoop off my current morning protein this is actually my favorite the quest salted caramel I put a scoop in each one and I will close this up and then I'll show you how I'll package them to take for my for my joke if I fly these don't hold up well on the plane they open up in the things drop out so if I fly and I carry my protein powders I usually put it in something with a screw on lid and I take one of the scoops and cut the handle off so the handles really really short and put it down in there so that I can measure the scoop out when I get there but this is going to be convenient because I can go to my car and just grab one of these kits that I'm about to make and when I finish just throw everything away I don't like throwing things away but this is a situation where I'm not gonna be able to wash things and bring them back I'm not going to be able to wash things and recycle them I'm making these reckless kits to carry to a place where space is limited so I will be carrying in one kit a day to make breakfast and I put a disposable cup a pack of oatmeal pack of the nuts my little container of protein and napkin in the spoon and then I tie up the plastic bag handles and I have a kit now I have one bag to put in my little simple carry travel back I'll have four that are full on with the nutrition and the protein powders and have a spare so I can just go out to my car and grab one take it inside at the team room fix my breakfast throw everything away when I'm done our carat weight carat with me in a car and eat it on the way to the conference room are the range wherever we're we're headed if you don't want to do the quest protein do with your little containers you can buy individual packs of protein if you want to put that in there and put those in instead of measuring it out and putting it in the little butter bowls and I do have those I keep those in my car and there is my breakfast for four days and with one spared the death protein but I do have a coaching pack in my car if I need it these are the provisions at the Sheraton Hotel much the same as what any hotel or motel room is going to have a coffee maker coffee and bottled water you can use the bottled water or the tap water if you trust it burn the hot water through the coffee maker you only need probably about 1/2 of a cup to make one serving pour the hot water into the cup that you have or if you forgot to bring the cup you can use one of theirs but make sure you wash it first if it's a glass one add the oatmeal stir the oatmeal up but it's set for a minute this is what it's going to look like I don't like mine too runny so I don't add a lot of water add the protein powder stir that up then add in your nuts you can add raisins dates really anything else that you want to are add nothing at all if you just want the oatmeal with a protein powder and this is what mine looks like the next slides are some that I'm and the team room when I went to Camden to do some tactical training I used a different a pack of nuts but I was able to do it there because we had had to carry machine and microwave this was in the country hearth a man that had a microwave and I was still able to eat my breakfast thank you for watching the video on having a good healthy high protein breakfast when you're traveling if you liked the video please feel free to share it hit the little like button and leave your comment below and until next time take care of yourself and if you're a breakfast person try these things out",

UK it is smoked with English oak it comes in this is the salt and then I take it and put it on top of a soft chewy caramel that's got a dark chocolate outside and then chalk this salt actually comes in pyramids little triangles when it first comes so it's got a nice little crunch a little bit of salt little bit of smokey then you get the dark chocolate and that chewy caramel in a minute I will be telling you and showing you how I cut the caramels and dip them talked with the chocolate there with the salt you so i just finished dipping cutting the caramels now it's time to dip the Colonel's so we put the caramel in the dark chocolate it's a fifty eight percent cacao chocolate so it's a semi-sweet chocolate take a little bit the excess off set it down and then we top it with a smoked sea salt and the salt that I'm using is smoked is naturally smoked over an English oak wood so it's got a very deep smoky flavor to it and it's just beautiful the dark chocolate with the dark smoky salt

so without further ado I would like to welcome a professor Roy Turner who gives his speech and I give this which will stitch to him now this was dumped professor goodness professor oh we cannot hear you can you hear me yes yes you can I'm okay let's start again that there's a good afternoon all it's a real pleasure to come to you this afternoon to discuss the very important topic that is heart failure we've really come a long way in a short period of time in the management of patients with heart failure I think it's fair to say we've still got quite a bit to do these are my disclosures now when I discuss heart failure I often show the slide it's a somewhat distressing image it's an image that in fact was an advert that the largest cardiovascular charity in the United Kingdom the British Heart Foundation from 2002 now as you could imagine from such an appalling image this advert was promptly withdrawn because of a number of complaints but what it did do is highlight the high morbidity and mortality rates patients have with heart failure but also what it did do is prompt the largest number of phone calls to the British Heart Foundation for help and advice not just from patients but also their carers now this trajectory is often shown the almost inevitable decline in heart function and quality of life experienced by patients with heart failure interferes with these periods of decompensation but of course at any point in the trajectory patients can experience sudden death but I think we're all aware know that the trajectory isn't always like this I've got a number of people that we assess for cardiac transplantation 17 or 18 years ago who are still in so coming back to clinic with a reasonable quality of life and in fact many patients who have presented with very poor carnet function subsequently have improved sometimes to normal err degrees of correct function the priorities we have for managing the heart failure patients is to make people feel better to keep them out of hospital because that's invade ibly the most expensive aspect of Heartfilia care but also to prevent patients dying prematurely now many of you are too young to remember this I certainly am this was from 1964 from a glassful teaching hospital and this was before the general availability of loop diuretics in 1966 one of the ways they managed to rustle edema using southeast tubes to drain edema into cups so not that long ago this is how were managing heart failure and in fact heart failure therapy in 1985 was very similar to 1785 when William withering found the medicinal uses of the foxglove plant and from which we obtained digitalis now I'm very fortunate in that I work in Glasgow and really from a very early stage it was apparent that heart failure care was very very integral to the way that cardiology care worked within the West of Scotland and really because of some key individuals I was had the pleasure of working with no you will be aware of many of these individuals in the top right-hand panel we have John McMurray who has been somewhat instrumentals a number of heart failure studies including paradigm HF and charm so on and so forth the bottom right-hand panel we have John Cohen who's the principal investigator for care HF with CRT pacemakers Henry Doorly in the middle layer at principal investigator status - up in the top from the smaller bubble and we've got Ian for - is the statistician involved in many current vascular studies particularly hard for their studies and of course in the black-and-white image in the bottom row Sir James black the inventor of the beta blocker so as I say heart failure was something that was drummed into me from a very early stage in my career and really over the last 33 years we've had a wealth of data presented to us on how we manage patients with heart failure and really this started in 1987 with a consensus study where an outlaw was compared with placebo and from then on we had the development of renin angiotensin L the steering system and sympathetic nervous system and our knowledge and understanding of those systems and how interfering with those systems could alternate patient's outlook and really things have moved on to emphasis and Paragon and a pitch after will mention some of those in today's presentation so up until recently we had a snippet of beta blockers and MREs is the cornerstone therapies in the management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction now all this pyramid looks very broad with device therapy and some very advanced options such as transplant mechanical circulatory support in fact the pyramid is much narrower unless these are very niche therapies for a small proportion of individuals for these things are appropriate for but the masses should be obtaining these cornerstone therapies and that's where we where until recently now you'll be aware that secular valsartan is a marriage of an angiotensin receptor blocker and a net will inhibit ur and together these drugs are vasodilators matcher ethics and antibiotics so very important aspects we think we can interfere with in the hope that I will improve patient outcome and of course the paradigm hf study which is presented in published in 2014 you'll be very aware of this was strongly positive no this isn't a very important study for a number of reasons firstly this was the first time we took a cornerstone drug for ethnobotanical and compared it with the Challenger circuit overhaul Sartain up until then all of the drugs that we were really gaining information about placebo controlled trials but this wasn't possible controlled this was an active comparator and a very good one at that and something that we all so often forget is the fact that this study was stopped prematurely by the data and safety monitoring board because of overwhelming benefit after a median follow-up of only 27 months and you can see on the Katz marker from the right hand annal very early on these curves diverge and this is very rare that you see a p-value so highly significant as the one that you see here and then it eight and a half thousand patients there was a 20% relative reduction in cardiovascular death or hospitalizations or heart failure and that's the number needed to treat 21 now in combined primary endpoints which are very common these days often it has been driven by one of the components of the primary endpoint but not so in paradigm HF in that cardiovascular mortality was reduced by 20% and heart failure hospitalizations reduced by very similar degree again both statistically significant we see for example from the shift' study with of Aberdeen the primary combined endpoint was being driven by heart for hospitalization but here both cardiovascular death and heart for hospitalization and what I think is really quite compelling is that you can see that scoodle valsartan reduces heart failure hospitalization within 30 days of switching from an ACE inhibitor so the longer we wait to switch a patient on statistical valsartan the greater the risk that is to that patient and that was a 40% relative risk reduction but not only does it reduce first heart failure hospitalization it reduces the revolving door of harvey oscillations that our patients often experience it's also good to be true well it's always important to look at an adverse event profile when you're considering a new or a relatively new drug and in fact what was very interesting is that less patients stopped sticking to walls Orton and padded AHF than they did enalapril so that's statistically significant the adverse event was more common with symptomatic hypotension but as I mentioned if the walls are turn as a naturally and a laser dilator and that is to be very expected and it became quickly apparent in fact that's when we started using suitable sorta and for me it was nearly 5 years ago now we recognize that the diuretic do the patient required very often reduced and so it became a matter of fact that we reduced the furosemide dose when we switched them from an ACE inhibitor testicular for certain and from then we have not had an issue with hypertension and in paradigm HF you were less likely to experience worsening renal function or hyperkalemia so it seems to be a very well tolerated drug with very beneficial effects so that where are we with heart failure reduced ejection fraction No well in fact Ethne Pater's have largely been replaced with stick observable Sartain and bit of lockers and MRA are vitally important in addition and then we can think the fancier things that can offer patients after reestablish the masses on the cornerstone therapies for heart failure and as such the clinical practice update from the heart failure cessation of the ESC in 2019 which again confirms that still valsartan is recommended as a replacement for ease limiters in the arabes and that's important to reduce these important endpoints that I mentioned to you but in fact the hf a went on to say that she drove all sort and may be considered in hospitalized patients with new onset heart failure and in particular those who are naive to a snippet or therapy and that was largely based on the pioneer in transition data that we don't have time to discuss during presentation but if there's questions about have we'll be delighted to do that towards the end so not only can we consider this as a switch but also for DeNoble patients a very interesting paper that has been published in Lancet is looking at important clinical trials of recent times paradigm HF that HF and emphasis comparing outcomes with conventional therapy with an ACE inhibitor and beta blocker so obviously this is just estimating benefit from clinical trials and the patients we look after don't necessarily represent those clinical trials but the estimates you are quite compelling there was a 62 percent reduction primary endpoint karna Vasa death at first heart failure hospitalization in fact the estimation was that if you treated patients with modern therapy you would afford them between one and a half and six years of additional survival compared to giving them just an eighth limited and beta blocker and I think we would all agree that's a very important message and I would suggest you read this paper it's very interesting okay so what a bit of heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction notice is where the quality of data suddenly diminishes somewhat this is ministering editorial some cattle and lambs got Solomon where the middle child and heart fairs described as heart filled with mid-range ejection fraction and this is looking at any effort between forty and fifty percent and in fact there's an interesting quote that says the older child which is half Ref gets all the wards a younger child half calf gets all the love and the middle child gets nothing and I'm seeing this as a middle child in fact the heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction is something we know far less about now of course when we look at the spread of ejection fraction we recognized that in fact that our patients out there with an ejection fraction between 40 and 50 percent certainly underrepresented in clinical trials and of course when we are putting people into clinical trials often be runners hair fair studies or half F studies and not have ref studies so what data are there out there well again we recognize increasingly that heart failure with mid-range ejection fractions actually resembles a sort of milder version of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction than half pets and in fact I think you'll find that F ref is going to be recorded as mildly reduced ejection fraction going forward rather than mid-range because there is this recognition that these individuals act more like FF patients than half pass now when we think about the way that we manage half path patients of course we're all aware that there's been significant disappointment and using the drugs that we commonly use in hair F in such a population in terms of outcomes that the patients will experience candesartan was clearly looked at in the charm program with heart via charm preserve now when we think about heaven rest will roughly about 17% of individuals 1,300 patients had hartley with mid-range ejection fraction with a median follow-up of 2.9 years the wars are reduction in the primary endpoint of kind of a slow death but not in the half pair patients and hair for ffs left but not half half and again current hospitalizations seem to be reduced with candesartan thoughts Lara's London's paper from 2018 and when we look at the effect on karavayev after harvest violation or its components according to ejection fraction again in this blue banded area there does seem to be some benefit from the use the ARB candesartan and half left patient simulator with beta blockers this is a pooled analysis of 11 beta blocker studies by john cleland who it's a farewell Glaswegian and again with ejection fractions between 40 and 49 percent that does seem to be a benefit in terms of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death with beta blockers in patients with sinus rhythm perhaps less compelling is the benefits in terms of hospitalization and again there's no suggestion in the healthcare population that beta blockers serve a patient an advantage looked at another way in terms of all-cause mortality or cardiovascular mortality again in this half knife population which you can see in the middle panel of top and bottom boxes again there seems to be a benefit with the use of beta blockers in heart favorite mid-range ejection fraction the top cap studies you all be aware of was randomized control trials from latin versus possible in heart failure with mid-range and preserved ejection fractions this was just under three and a half thousand patients the patients had ejection fractions of 45 percent or above and we're followed up for three point three years as you can see on the panel on the right that does seem to be a dependent process depending on your ejection fractions or patients with the law rejection fraction the more half-caf patients did seem to offer some advantage but again this is looking at data and subgroup analysis what we're also recognized from Top Cat is of a significant regional variation so the mortality rates are what's higher in patients repeated in the Americas compared to Russia and Georgia and effects through Latin seem to have some benefit in the populations from the Americas compared to Russia and Georgia and somebody the waters somewhat further that there did seem to be a problem in terms of the individuals randomized at Easter Latin group in Russia and Georgia rowing the boat 1/3 of them did not have metabolites in their urine or an electron and as you're probably aware they're running a further version of this trial to look at their effects as from Latin and half half and half Neff a bit more detail so time will tell us from Latin is useful for this patient group in addition we had some early phase 2 randomized control data of certain Mozart and versus valsartan in patients with an ejection fraction of 45 percent or above B for individuals with NYT class 2/3 heart failure and an NT could be NP about 400 pictograms per mil that these individuals were followed up for 36 weeks and the primary endpoint was really looking at a change in ntp NP a very powerful substrate really for cardiovascular outcomes that's it's something that we use routinely in the UK as I'm sure you do across the world and we recognize that high NT from BMP is a harbinger of doom those security valsartan was well tolerated miss population again with adverse events similar to those of all Sartain and what we saw was a much higher reduction at NTP BNP in those individuals randomized - which is previously known by lcz 696 what they also saw was a reduction in left atrial volume in those randomized skittle valsartan so some interesting early work suggesting that may be benefits to devolve our fan in this half left population so of course you'll be aware of the Paragon HF study which was just under 5,000 patients with nyg class - for heart failure we've individuals with an ejection fraction of 45 percent or above evidence of an elevated NT will be N key and structural changes either with LVH or left atrial enlargement and they were randomized to receive either valsartan or Tsukuba valsartan aiming for the target dose of 97 is regarding three milligrams twice daily or 200 milligrams twice daily whichever is the preparation that you have in your country the primary endpoint is cardiovascular death and total so that's first and recurrent heart failure horse violations though they anticipated 1721 primary events which is quite important now again the kaplan-meier curves appear to diverge from in a very early stage that you can see the p-values rather depressing leave 0.06 and unfortunately it is recognised under 10 X 2 endpoints would have seen this being a positive trial but intention to treat this was a neutral study and so therefore further analysis of a neutral study should be taken with a pinch of salt but what we did recognize is it seemed to be a signal that stripped of all start and reduced total heart failure hospitalizations but no suggestion that reduced cardiovascular death and it's important to point out the cubital valsartan is only indicated currently for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction but it is interesting to see there is a suggestion that there's a reduction heart rate hospitalization that has a see this is one of the components of the neutral primary outcome when we look at their fix of all certain rejection faction that you can see in the top panel here the Dead Sea seem to be a difference depending on whether your ejection fraction was above or below the median at 57% with those for the new Jackson facts less than 57% seeming to obtain benefits from stick observable sorta looked at another way so this is a looking at the effects of all start an across the ejection fraction spectrum again work by Scott Salomon listed as pre-specified analysis combining data from paradigm HF as well as Paragon and again you can see that there seems to be a benefit across the ejection fractions to agent about 55% in terms of total heart failure horseflies ation or cardiovascular death they're very similar to work to what was done previously after paradigm HF was published by one of my colleagues partyand really titled workout the benefits of stripped of all certain verses putative possible and what they did was they looked at the caramel terms of study paradigm HF and were able to compute a benefit in terms of comparison to Siebel so they've gone one step further and compared Paragon to Charm preserves to see if there's any benefit at Stovall's art and not to valsartan but to Siebel and again very similar to Scott Solomon's work you can see that particular wall Sartain appears to benefit patients up to ejection fractions of around about 57% in terms of total heart rate hospitalization and kind of a slow death now this is statistically significant remembering that Paragon itself was a neutral study what we recognize those are heart failure patients aren't nestle those patients with clinical trials they tend to be older and they have greater amounts of comorbidity a very interesting paper from Natalie Conrad from The Lancet in 2080 18 was looking at heart failure patients from the United Kingdom and in fact the number of patients with three or more comorbidities with heart failure has increased from 2002 to 14 where 87% of individuals with heart failure of three or more comorbidities and the comorbidities are represented here there's some likely offenders that you will recognize it's a fibrillation diabetes hypercholesterolemia obesity and so on and so forth but also our patients are more complicated than them perhaps clinical trials might suggest now it's important to point out so valsartan has been looked at the pre-specified analysis and half ref in terms of common core morbidities like diabetes EF and hypertension and there's no suggestion whether you have this comorbidity or not that you gain it any less benefit in fact the benefit seems to be across the board so thinking about potential treatments for comorbidities look going forward with heart failure reduced ejection fraction and heart failing with mildly produced a mid-range ejection fraction IV iron that's something that's being shown to improve six-minute walk and quality of life in patients with FAS there's a couple of clinical trials ongoing at the moment that IV iron in a chronic heart failure population an Ironman which is using IV isomalt IDs and also fed a carboxyl mortals and the Fermi HF study the latter study being in patients hospitalized with acute heart failure so we know that iron deficiency is common and heart failure patients and what we want to tease out is whether IV iron improves outcome in terms of mortality in our heart failure patients in terms of sglt2 inhibitors that's recognized now from the DAP hf study but apical Falls and improves patient outcomes in terms of reduction in mortality as well as hospitalization and certainly from the declared Timmy fifty-eight study this seemed to be particularly in patients with Harris but in terms of hospitalization that was also signaled for patients who didn't have heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and as such there are two large clinical trials the sglt2 inhibitors in heart failure with mid-range and preserved ejection fractions the emperor preserved in the delivery studies and hopefully we'll find out more about this class of aging in this patient population going forward something that has been shown to be of benefit in patients with both FF and half-half it's a cardamoms device now I'd be interested to hear what your experience it with the cardamoms devices but in the champion study which is 550 patients from the US there was a 36% relative risk reduction in heart rate hospitalization and what we recognized in the PA pressure monitored group is that the PA pressures felt substantially but actually rules in the control groups where they went gaining access to the pulmonary artery monitoring data now what we saw from champion observers nearly a 99% freedom from device related complications but it's because as you probably know this is a tiny device with nitinol wings which doesn't have a battery or a computer it's placed by doing a palma or kilogram passing a wire down the polarity particularly one that's passing posteriorly so it's closer to the toll that the patients lie on on a daily basis over the top of the wire the device is deployed it's then calibrated by another right heart catheter and it's left in tissue and this is what it looks like on chest x-ray this is an individual with single chamber ICD and you can just see on the cardiac silhouette the cardamoms device Institute of what we see our daily trends patients lie on the pillow for about 18 second every day and it gives us upon reality pressure and allows us to adjust the diuretic therapy accordingly and this is the type of press release that you get so it can be quite a useful device in reducing heart failure hospitalization in particular and in fact we've just hot-off-the-press finished a UK study of cardamoms involve heifer F ref and PES and demonstrated an 81 percent reduction and heart rate hospitalization with the use of this device but of course it is a very expensive device and you could certainly pay for very many prescriptions on six or valsartan at other key drugs for the place on one Center but it's also recognized this device does work in both heart failure with preserved and that was described some injection fraction at forty percent or above or half ref in the champion study something else device wife it might be useful for air this is something that we are involved in clinical trials whereas the reduce LEP device from DC devices and this is where we deliberately make a halt across the atrial septum to reduce pressure within the left edge within the left atrium this is an MRI scan with a device in situ and hopefully you can see shunting of blood from the left atrium at the bottom into the right atrium offloading and this person's left atrial cache and you can see the significant left atrial and radiate chill dilatation here it's what we recognized with patients with heart rate preserved ejection factors false the pulmonary artery pressure may be satisfactory at rest it goes up significantly with exercise particularly in the left atrium left atrial pressure analogies and with the use of this shunt you get equalization of pressure time will tell if this is a useful device going forward so what I think well I think that heart fair care particularly reduced ejection fraction has been completely transformed over the last three decades that we don't use angiotensin receptor blockers anymore they've never been shown to be superior tennis on the pattern in fact we know that suitable valsartan is significantly superior tennis limiter so for that reason we don't use er B's now I think it's only a matter of time before East limiters are the drugs that are only used in hair s including de novo initiation I think we'll gain more information from the Paradise ni study which is you may be aware is looking at post on my LV dysfunction and this study is randomizing patients to valsartan or ramipril and that studies due to report I believe in quarter three of next year we also recognize that heart failure with mid-range ejection fax acts more like heart failure with reduced ejection fraction than F which is good because we appear to have treatments for F breath rather than half path but I also believe that we should use any opportunity we can to improve our patient care what will a guideline see well the SC heart forgave aims are due to be updated next year so time will tell how heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction is portrayed but I think the change in definition is certainly is going to be one of them and so in summary heart failure patients have a high risk of mortality we know this and we recognize however that we can manage that particularly well with treatments that we have on offer it's important for us also remember even those individuals with mild symptoms they can of a very pure outlook and sometimes the first manifestation of worsening may be sudden death we recognize it's the wall Sartain reduces the risk of death and hospitalization and heart rate reduced ejection fraction and the fire reduces sudden death by 20% in addition to the data that I've already presented to you and there is a signal to improved outcome in the heart fear mid-range ejection fraction Westerkamp doubles our time and I suppose I wanted to leave you with this question before you give me your questions as what would you want to be prescribed if the patient happened to be you thank you very much for listening a lot being great to get involved in a great discussion on heart of hair care thank you very much professor Garner in the hall then we can give a big applause but individual will move on applause as well so professor I think that's very nice presentation and we can see it very clear the benefit of one of the leading drugs in the heart failure now which is army I just I just love to call it Abney one easier to remember and very shot so what I see in our local practice here the one that really we take into granted after the admission to the CCU or crw or in the general ward is when we did the urgent egg hole we try to get echo in the same admission after which within the heart failure the only lacking time things that we are compared to the research world is this biomarker so I think in our locker practically when we are in the teaching hospital I've been trying to get some budget to use as routine the empty probe and pio probe empty except for the management but so far we are still lacking of those additional materials which is the biomarker we only use that for the teaching purpose which is the research that we are conducting our own local research alternator trial that we are collaborating with all the things are higher in the world so this number one that we are not able to copy the system management that they are recommending in the guideline or in the research itself was randomized control trial research that really give benefit to this type of group so and then also we try to get the resource extra resource which is the echocardiogram it sounds quite easy but when you are in the General Hospital of General Teaching Hospital to get the echo done in the next day it takes a good resource for that so but when we we saw the patient in the world after we get the echocardiogram and when we see the ejection fraction is more than 50 cents and some of some of this patient fall into the mid-range group so when we see this patient we try to be relaxed a little bit I think that's some of the mistake from our physician from our clinical world here that when we see this type of patient we tend to be relaxed between the investigation for the investigation that we need to be ordered by a surgeon angiogram and depending on the estimate but the or any other of the investigation we try to slow down a bit and also one of the leading call mobility in this type of group is the a potential so have a tension button and also the ischaemic button in this type of group if you calculate that give me some time that see my score is lower then the agency of to do the angiogram is less in this type of group I think this is the mid-range and the prison ejection pressure we tend to be overlooked a little bit in our clinical practice in this part of the world any comments from your professor from from our first observation for the heart failure admission management here yeah so some very good points that you've made so of course BNP was discovered in 1988 so it's not a new biomarker and has been involved in the guidelines for many many years now I've have to say when I took on my consultant roles 12 years ago one of the first business cases I did was to get npnp because it is a very valuable biomarker but it's not I wouldn't say it's essential but it's valuable we have also recognized it's always very recently in the UK that BNP has been universally available and in some instances particularly in Scotland we've done that in collaboration with Pharma because as you probably know anti blue BNP is produced largely by Arras Diagnostics and many of the pharma companies have particularly of artists have a share within Ross Diagnostics and sometimes deals can be done where it can lessen the price of VMP so we pay about 10 pounds which is about 14 years dollars for one BNP test we were not doing it on admission and discharge we're doing it usually once a week that's what we would generally do I check it every time somebody comes to clinic because I think it's a very useful prognostic marker as you know that I manage patients on the sicker of the spectrum and what I want see with the treatment that I'm offering the patient is a reduction in in people BMP and that's what you would expect and in fact those individuals who they're NT proven P flowers to rise despite your best efforts they are the ones to be very concerned about whether that's considering them for advanced strategies or indeed palliative care and device deactivation but it does it's a crystal ball it's a form of communication and I think it's a useful thing to have but it's not essential and anything you can do to try and get it would be would be useful there are a number of companies working on point-of-care tests well there are some available already we're working with a local company in fact we have no developed point-of-care tests that can do ten different biomarkers from one finger prick test so that's quite a useful thing as well and again it's not that expensive and the ket is roughly about ten or fifteen pounds per port so that is something is useful I think is really key to try and get an echo during admission of a heart failure patient particularly if you don't do what the rejection faction is because it helps you rules of therapy going forward if that heart a reduced ejection fraction or indeed half half that you've mentioned but I have to confess that we are fortunate in the UK in healthcare it's much less common than half ref primary care physicians have been incentivized for many years to identify and treat hypertension from an early stage and so therefore we don't see much in the way of lv8 related to hypertension and if we see it it's more likely related to a or text analysis or indeed somebody who turns out of oakum so we don't see much in the way of related hypertensive heart disease but obviously there will be the patients who purely adhere to therapy but I think it's key to try and get some imaging of the heart during admission of heart failure if you don't do about the ejection fraction yeah I deal with your professor and now we are running in our centre here the heart failure special heart failure Kinney once a month so we have the biomarker inside - and also the echo at the ground as well so I think that one is really helpful but that one is really focused on the reduced ejection fraction a group that we are channeling to maintain that those are to increase the dose of the army dose okay so that's some improvement in hours of this here in in our Park City Hospital here so the other thing is I think and ischemic burden professor so in your Center that if you see someone like reduce ejection fraction with some ECG changes how soon that you are interested to put the patient to the cath lab yes that direction so we don't everything we do angiograms anymore in patients increasingly we're using cardiac MRI and if somebody has significantly gadda lynnium enhanced and suggestive of coronary disease we would pretend to do an angiogram at that point what we don't know truly is about revascularization so there are advocates of bypass surgery and individuals with coronary disease and LV dysfunction following on from stitch in stitches we're currently running a trial within the UK called the revived study which is randomizing patients with coronary disease to PCI verses medical therapy so hopefully we'll establish whether if you've got coronary artery disease is it worth doing something about it I think it's different if somebody has chest pain if somebody has ischemic sounding chest in than we would do an angiogram but less less we're doing it routinely in our heart failure patients yeah for the special group of the reserve ejection fraction our professor so when you're dealing with this type of group I think some of the questions are there already on the checkbox which is you know how exists is you want to treat this type of group as I said in our Center here I what I see from my observation is that we tend to overlook this group which is when we put into the analysis and not much drugs can help but how exist is that we are going to do with this type of especially in the preserve ejection fraction profession yeah so as you know have had patients tend to be older it is a depressing group of individuals to manage because every drug trial of course every drug trials are very expensive investment from pharma companies and in fact investigators such as URI it's quite an involved process to recruit patients and of course it's been very disappointing all the clinical trials for half pass with drug certainly have been disappointing I have to say that we we use diuretics as our mainstay therapy we do use through lateral in those individuals as well I think that topcat was a study that was cheated I think the water signal was benefit we can't say for certain because we have to go with the pre-specified endpoints and intention-to-treat and the way the study was designed it was a neutral study but certainly I think the signal enough for it to be worthwhile to give patients and I think as long as serum biochemistry is monitored from laps and is a relatively safe drug and we haven't had particularly patients or enlargements have looked diuretic of course it salts offsetting the potassium issue so we do use from Latin we're not using suitable valsartan for 1/2 F if somebody had a in the mid-range ejection fraction it as a patient we would consider for a suitable certain and Scotland we're allowed to currently a gift script of us are done for injection fraction of 40 percent or less but of course we all recognize that ejection fraction is not a precise thing so on one day it might be 40 percent the next day it might be 40 for the next day it might be 36 what's the right thing for the patient but settling will help if it is a diuretic based strategy we have phone cardamoms to be quite useful in selected individuals but actually that the most reduced iPhone from cardamoms is in ensuring patients adhere to their therapy and often what we see is in somebody with the pressures rising and rising you form them up and say are you taking your freezer made and they say actually no I haven't been seeing his light and the pressure has come down again so it's quite an expensive way of shooting somebody takes the tablet if cardamoms used in malaysia I say get if cardamoms used in malaysia kinda man i I think I have to check with IJ and I wasn't still not yes and yet use this type of pressure but I think additional management I think it's in the in the bigger institution institution to negara which national heart of malaysia they sometimes use quite advanced technology but so far in our Center in our agency Hospital we haven't explored yet this kind of sensing but I think it surely benefits this condiment but back to the historical drugs professor before we go to the chatbox the usage of this detoxing so what I see in my clinical practice digoxin I love that especially when you have a little bit of Eddie's Mia and blood pressure tend to be low especially in the reduced ejection fraction so I tend to use digoxin what is your experience and how do you manage and this historical drugs in your centre provision so of course the the place that we usually use - Jaques mizzen individuals with atrial fibrillation and heart fair to reduce ventricular rate in addition to a beta blocker but of course as you know the digital was a sinus rhythm study so it was a study where all individuals at baseline run sinus rhythm not EF so we do use the dachshund but certainly not nearly as much as they did in the US so roughly about 10% of individuals with heart failure and sinus rhythm would be on digoxin no more than I think a sizeable proportion of RAF patients but obviously we give priority to beat a blocker first and foremost and add on digoxin if necessary as you know the jocks is also not great at controlling EF rate with exercise so it usually has to be given with a beta blocker and somebody is usually make there are instances and people were very advanced symptoms where digoxin makes people feel a bit better I think the key certainly from my reading of the literature is to maintain a see them digoxin concentration on the lure and certainly less than one point two because there is a suggestion that mortality goes up because it's got a very narrow therapeutic window as we all recognize and of course many of the patients that we consider using it in our elderly patients and there are patients who could suffer the consequences of digoxin toxicity particular way so we use it with caution and not commonly so probably we go to the checkbox there one of the question that was posted before I did a lot of question but when they catch my eye there when as to drugs expensive which is the water if the drugs the new drugs which is the Omni and also the SDLP too so one of the audience here is asking if you want to start which one that you prefer professor I think there is quite difficult for me because my patient needs to pay both of it and we don't have a special subsidy from that group that that drug so some of the patient really need to pay at a full price of the army and also the sglt2 so there one of the audience is asking which you either use rather stuff first bro okay so good question that I kind of anticipated this was going to come up so it was key is the fact that script of all Sartain and data Gospels and our different drugs working in different ways and they are not competing drugs they're complementary drugs so obviously there were no patients on an sglt2 inhibitors and paradigm because it was before the sglt2 inhibitors were routinely used but eleven percent of patients in de Pierrefonds tickets or loss are times we do have some clinical trial experience and certainly from that small proportion of individuals on scheduled valsartan and DAPA HF there was no signal that they were benefiting any less or more than the general population so these are not competing drugs these are complementary drugs and I'm speaking from the luxury of being in the UK where patients don't pay for the drugs so if a drug is indicated and it's approved the patient doesn't pay so we are already using sglt2 inhibitors in our patients virtually all my kids I've pulled my patients relatively recently and these are half ref patients 93% were unsuitable Sartain and we've already got just under 50% on data covers you know clearly it's a waiting it's hard for your license we're allowed to give it in diabetics because of course it's got to diabetic license that we are starting to use it in the non diabetics as well so I'm not forced to make the choice between one or the other we give both what I would point out though and this is important for the audiences both have diuretic Master etic effects obviously the sglt2 inhibitors are osmotic diuretics and again it's another opportunity to reduce the patient's loop diuretic dose further and which patients are delighted about because they don't like the freezer made em if I had to choose I would choose suitable Sartain because the evidence bases it's a bigger trial it was done earlier and every component that we've looked at in terms of reduction pump failure death reduction and sudden death is reduced it's actually interesting so this unpublished data but data that John McMurray shown me is a knee that is a flayed available is data corals and appears to reduce sudden death rather than failure death which was a surprise to me I thought as a holistic diuretic it would have an impact and pump failure death whereas to give the wall Sartain does each type of her face seems to be reduced with it so if I was forced with my arm twisted behind my back have faced acute oval Sartain but in reality with pimples so some of the audience when is asking regarding a dose of the amnesia so some of it is called the dose starting good in the trial is fifty hundred and two hundred so some of the practicing physician are using 25 milligrams a half of the 50 milligram dose so what do you think of the type of the management I think this one I saw even in my own practice some time you want to compensate between the benefit and also the relief which is some of them I really have the hovering blood pressure at around hundred systolic blood pressure so you tend to be used at half of the dose of the minimum so what do you think of the design like this profession so I've never used half of the minimum dose before from an so that's a surprise to me I mean normally what we do is we get rid of superfluous drugs as well so it's quite common for a number of individuals to be on amlodipine other types of diuretics such as cyanide for static therapies other things that can cause hypertension but of course a blood pressure of 100 millimeters of mercury it doesn't bother me at all and in fact I remember my very first ward round in 1996 with John McMurray as a junior doctor even a terrifying individual particularly in those days and of course blood pressure was mentioned on the ward Road and the main thing and this is a Scottish place but if a patient is thinking peeing so the whelp refused and passing urine and they've got end-organ perfusion then blood pressure has a number doesn't really matter so much so the vast majority of our patients are on either the middle dose which you would call 100 milligrams twice daily or indeed the top dose and only a small portion along the lowest dose 50 milligrams twice daily and you have the Vantage it allowed call it 50 milligrams twice daily we have split up into individual components we have to be 24 stroked 26 hours twice daily you", "KHaL52yVogc": "that's what we have here Oliver is here from the old times ganged up please

here. Welcome back to the podcast. Evan, how we are doing today man? Evan Brand: I\u2019m doing great, good morning\nto you. We\u2019re ready to talk about food poisoning. You got food poisoning. What was it, a week\nago now that we are talking? Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Yeah, so I was in\nBoston for a wedding last weekend and I got sick. I was in the north and I did pretty\ngood. I did like a ribeye steak with this broccoli and I was okay, but something didn\u2019t\nfeel right with that kinda mixture. I did go afterwards, and I do this once a year.\nI did have a cannoli with gluten and dairy in it. So, I did get that. That\u2019s like my\none thing cause it\u2019s just like so great. But the previous two years as well, so I\u2019m\nlike, is it really dairy ang gluten thing? So there\u2019s just two different light levers\nhere. Alright, you got like food poisoning where it\u2019s like bacteria kinda thing like\nan e-coli kinda thing. It could be food poisoning AKA an infection like a parasite or bigger\nbug, or number three, it could be inflammation from the food. Both kinda similar. First thing\nI did was, I was alright, enzymes, charcoal, ginger, you know, anti-inflammatory southing\nsupport that kinda calm things down. And the big thing was I was so noxious. The ginger\nreally helped but it couldn\u2019t keep it down all the way, so that was number one. I\u2019m\nlike, alright. And then I was doing a lot of L glutamine so I\u2019m like, I don\u2019t think\nthis an inflammation thing. Its lasting a little bit too long. I started to hit a little\nbit of oil of oregano, didn\u2019t move in a ton, so I was doing my GI clear five oil of\noregano, wasn\u2019t moving a ton then I started hitting, when I got back home, my GI clear\nfour and I knocked it right away. So there was some kind of I think a bigger bug in there\nso I don\u2019t think inflammation that I caught but with in a day, with in two doses of my\nGI 4 which has the Berberine the Goldenseal the Burdock the Black Walnut, my nausea went\nright away. So im still on it now I\u2019m gonna take actually one of it as we speak. Evan Brand: So, were you throwing up or you\nwere just noxious? Dr. Justin Marchegiani: I didn\u2019t have any\ndiarrhea or any you know throwing up. It was just like just incredible amount of nausea\nlike whoa! Evan Brand: Like a scale of 1 to 10, 10 is\nthe worst nausea ever, where were you? Dr. Justin Marchegiani: It was probably like\nan 8 Evan Brand: Oh, that\u2019s pretty bad\u2026 Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Like I didn\u2019t wanna\nmove, like I thought very uncomfortable moving at al. Evan Brand: and you were flying back home\u2026 Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Oh yeah, I mean what\nreally helped thos, those GT dave's kombucha, the ginger really really helped. I mean I\nwas doing that\u2026 Evan Brand: You were saying Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Yeah, I was doing\nthe Kettle & Fire bone broth which is very soothing as well. So I was just doing bone\nbroth, kettle & fire, to the ginger kombucha, and I was hitting pro biotics, hitting activated\ncharcoal, and then I was nailing the oil of oregano the last day. The oil of oregano didn\u2019t\ntouch it as much, but the GI Clear 4 really knocked it up. Typically I tell my patients\nand you travel, go with the GI Clear 4 and 5 when you travel, just to insure that you\ndon\u2019t have any food poisoning issues or you get an infection. So my generalized stack\nif you\u2019re travelling is one doze of probiotics, in my line like a probiotic 4, the lactobacillus\nkinda hindus lactobacillus bifidobacter species, I GI Clear 5 which is a higher dose oil of\noregano, and then my GI Clear 4 which is a broader spectrum, bigger parasite kinda killer,\nand then activated charcoal. Evan Brand: Yep. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Like my big four and\nthen like a little bit of enzymes and HCL too so actually five. That\u2019s my stack for\ntravelling. Evan Brand: You must have probably picked\nsomething up then because that sounds more than just\u2026 I mean maybe it was food poisoning.\nBut if it took you to throw in berberine and a lot of these anti-microbial herbs, it sound\nlike to me, I mean I\u2019ll just make up something out of thin air, maybe picked up Clostridia,\nor some other bacterial pathogen that took you over. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Yeah, I mean the oil\nof oregano didn\u2019t move it as much, but when I got the GI Clear 4, it was like holy smokes.\nIt went away in about 3 hours. Evan Brand: I was gonna say it was a coincidence\nthat it just got out of your immune system and your immune system mounted the attack\nor you think it was the herbs that really knocked it out? Dr. Justin Marchegiani: It was the herbs.\nI mean I was doing my GI Clear 5 the day before. I did 12 capsules, so I was hitting it hard.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I think it\u2019s still important to do that. Evan Brand: Yeah. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: I will just do it\ncentergisticly. I did really good success with the 5 at other types of food poisoning,\nso it does work very legitimate. I had a parasite in Mexico years back, and that was very helpful\nbut the 4 really did it, so my stack for travelling is GI Clear 4 and 5. But the 4 is like the\nmost important, 5 is kinda secondary, and then the probiotics too are super helpful\nand I recommend enzyme. You\u2019re eating any questionable foods. Activated charcoal and\nenzymes and HCL is great. Just to ensure your digesting and breaking everything down. Evan Brand: I was speaking of enzymes. I was\ntalking to my wife yesterday about how when I went over to your house, you cooked a nice\nsteak for me, and you had your little caddy on your table full of like three different\nbrands of enzymes on your dinner table, I loved that. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Yeah. Yep. Evan Brand: Your wife and your mother-in-law,\nall of us we had just a whole handful of enzymes we were able to take right there. See I\u2019ve\ngot the in the pantry or in the cabinet in the kitchen, but then you sit down in the\ntable and you forget so you gotta run into the kitchen and grab your enzymes. So I think\nI\u2019m gonna adopt your roll there on having enzymes right on the table so you don\u2019t\nforget \u2018em. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Yeah. I put them right\nwith the salt and pepper like keep it really simple, really easy, I mean I think the low\nhanging fruit and functional medicine world is be able to digest your food well. If we\nspending a lot of money on good quality organic food we wanna make sure we can digest it and\nbreak it down especially when you\u2019re eating when you\u2019re stress, because that fight-or-flight\nnervous system response really keeps the enzymes and hydrochloric acid levels lower so maybe\nyou\u2019re not making as much, so I think that\u2019s really important. Evan Brand: Yeah, I\u2019m back on enzymes so,\nwe could talk about this for a minute, you know. A lot of people have the\u2026 they\u2019ve\ngot a question of well, if I\u2019m taking enzymes, am I making my body lazy? And the answer\u2019s\nno. it\u2019s not like melatonin where if you take melatonin you can down regulate your\nproduction. With enzymes, you\u2019re really just adding to the fire. You\u2019re not replacing\nit and that becomes more important as you get older too. But for us, you know we\u2019ve\ngot a baby now and so she\u2019s 4-weeks-old, maybe she\u2019s five weeks, I don\u2019t know.\nTime\u2019s already flying. But if we\u2019ve got the baby, im tryna hold her, mom\u2019s tryna\nhold her or keep her happy while we\u2019re eating dinner. we\u2019re not optimally digesting, we\u2019re\nnot in parasympathetic tryna keep two kids happy at mealtime. So we\u2019re back on enzymes\nnow just the insurance policy. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Yep. And I think it\u2019s\ngreat when you\u2019re eating when you\u2019re stress. If you\u2019re doing great and your diet\u2019s\nreally good and you\u2019re feeling stable with everything and you can actually sit down and\nrelax fine. Then I think it\u2019s totally cool that you don\u2019t necessarily need it, as long\nas digestion over all is good. But if you\u2019re definitely more on the stress side, and you\u2019re\neating a meal a little bit faster then I think it\u2019s good to always have them as an insurance\npolicy. I just keep them right there so if I fill the need to have it, I\u2019m right ready\nto go. Evan Brand: One thing you didn\u2019t mentioned,\nwhich I think we should mention for you know\u2026 Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Yeah Evan Brand: Just general\u2026 yeah\u2026 getting\nhit with something like that would aloe. You know, there\u2019s a couple different aloe extracts\nthat we used. I\u2019ve got one, do you have your own aloe as well? Dr. Justin Marchegiani: In my GI restore,\nI have a 4ml that has aloe TJ and glutamine, so I do like that for gut soothing and gut\nhealing support. And then one thing when I was travelling, I went to whole foods and\nI bought some aloe juice. So I did get some aloe juice, I would sip in on that. I do find\nit very soothing and it was very palliative, wasn\u2019t fixing the underlying issue doest\nmean you shouldn\u2019t put it in there. Cause even if you have infection ther\u2019s gonna\nbe some level inflammation present so it\u2019s gonna help calm it down. Evan Brand: True, true. I see so many kids\nwith gut issues. I feel like it\u2019s probably more common than even the adults that I see.\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just that you know the kids are finding the answers from the\npediatrician, so they end up reaching out to us or what but when I\u2019m looking at stool\ntest lately, I\u2019m finding kids\u2019 gut are so much inflamed. I mean I\u2019m seeing 7 or\n8 hundred 9 hundred on the calprotectin. It\u2019s like, my Lord. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: And that\u2019s a very\nhigh level I mean that basically in like irritable vowel desease kinda category. You know that\nyou\u2019d see the crones and also the fled, that\u2019s really high. And I think a lot of\nit is you see have more crap food out there for kids today. I mean my God, it\u2019s very\nrare to see kids eating whole foods. It\u2019s very rare to see kids even just drink water\nlike my son, he drinks sparkling mineral water, he drinks water and he drinks unsweetened\ncrane juice like with kale, broccoli, spinach, like no added fruit, no added sugar at all\noutside on what on those green vegetables. And then he has meet sole for breakfast, still\nhave half of an avocado today, a piece and half of bacon, and then maybe a couple of\nblack berries and some coconut unsweetened vanilla yogurt. Like that\u2019s it, that\u2019s\nhis breakfast and for lunch, it\u2019s tough with kiddos so I try to always recommend with\nparents, whole cuts tend to work really well on kids just choose a higher quality one.\nLike at the Applegate or the Wellshire Farm works at least at step two, so you at least\ngetting a pretty good quality, or if we do the hotdogs, we get the Wholefood step 4 so\nthey\u2019re at least grass-fed and organic in pastrofed hotdog so at least the meet quality\nis high so those are good. Evan Brand: Another uncured as well so\u2026 Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Yep Evan Brand: You\u2019re not having bunch of night\ntrades or other sodium into rebates added, you don\u2019t want those. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Yeah. That\u2019s overblown\nkinda thing especially its coming from celery powder. But either way the more important\nthing is the food quality is there. And if we can\u2019t get the vegetables in, we at least\ndo the green juice. He\u2019ll pound 8 to 10 ounces of high-quality green vegetable juice\na day. That\u2019s helpful. Evan Brand: I gotta tell you about something.\nI just found today and we ate it this morning, it was absolutely so delicious so my wife\nwanted to do waffles for a long time so we were looking at all these different grain-free\nwaffle recepice, but we went to Wholefoods and there\u2019s this brand called Swapples.\nDo you know Swapples? Dr. Justin Marchegiani: No, I don\u2019t know\nSwapple. Evan Brand: Oh my God, alright so I\u2019ll send\nyou the link here. But they\u2019re grain-free like this is an auto immune approved. I got\nthe cinnamon one, I\u2019ll send you the link here. This thing was so good, I thought this\ncan\u2019t be real how good this is. So it\u2019s yucca, let\u2019s see let me tell you the ingredients\nhere. Yucca, coconut oil, organic coconut palm sugar, 2 grams of sugar, I think per\nwaffle, cinnamon, sea salt, vanilla extract. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Swapples, okay I\u2019ll\nput some links in the description bellow. That\u2019s awesome. Are they premade already? Evan Brand: Yeah, it\u2019s premade. You just\nthrow it in the oven for like 10 minutes at 375 and its ready. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: That is awesome dude.\nThat\u2019s really cool, Swapples. Okay cool. Evan Brand: I think you told me when you were\nin Austin that you say you goy yucca, yucca pancakes that you got? Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Well I picnicked,\nyeah anyone that knows picnic is awesome for their autoimmune gluten-free, grain-free type\nof foods they have great yucca-based waffle and pancakes. So I would do like blueberry\npancake. Evan Brand: That\u2019s delicious. So they have\nother ones too that people can use like as a bread replacement. Still gonna be you know,\ncarbohydrates. If you trying to stay in ketosis or something, this is not gonna work for you.\nBut they got like a tomato basil one which is the yucca yucca, however you say it, coconut\noil, tomato, sea salt, spice, and garlic. So if you\u2019re like one of those people who\njust can\u2019t leave without bread, and its like pulling teeth for you, for us to get\nyou to an autoimmune template, you maybe able to do something like this instead and get\nyou off of the grains, I mean. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Yeah, I like that. Evan Brand: I love the stuff like this exist. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: That\u2019s awesome.\nYeah I have a recipe in my website basically it pretty simple it\u2019s a half cup of coconut\nmilk, 2 and half cup of coconut flour, to four eggs. That\u2019s it. And its blended up\nand then we use a waffle maker and we just put it in there, its done. So that\u2019s another\ngood option too if you wanna make it, coconut flour, coconut milk, and eggs. But this is\nnot a great option, its always nice to have them pre-made so if you\u2019re in a rush you\njust can heat them up fast and be done with it. Evan Brand: Yep, absolutely. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: That\u2019s great. Evan Brand: I wanna share that cause like\npeople are always like looking for things cause they wanna get off their diet, you know\nthey\u2019re like \u201coh I feel deprived, or I miss this food. I miss that food\u201d I mean\nI\u2019m still trying to get my grandfather off chocolate milk, you know. So, its like wo\ngot a long way to go. People would think our families listen to us on everything but at\nleast my family doesn\u2019t. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Yeah, it\u2019s tough.\nFor sure the key this is to have substitution mindset like what\u2019s the substitute, what\u2019s\nthe switch, what can we incorporate in there that will provide similar mouthfeel, will\nyou feel good about it, you enjoy, the taste\u2019s good, but you\u2019re not getting the crap. So,\nI love options like these. Especially the carbohydrates and the sugar in a pretty good\nspot. So, I like it. That makes a lot of sense man. Evan Brand: What about the serials and all\nthat? Have you found any alternatives? Cause so many people \u201cwhy do I do I can\u2019t have\nserial anymore?\u201d. Like what do you push people towards in the morning? Dr. Justin Marchegiani: There\u2019re some decent\nlite paleo granola that\u2019s out there that\u2019s more nut and seed based. So that pretty good.\nAnd then you can use like a coconut milk kinda thing for it. If you\u2019re on autoimmune templet,\nthat wouldn\u2019t be as good because its nut and seed based. Evan Brand: Right. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: That\u2019s a good option\nas well in the morning. Option number 2 is just a really simple collagen based smoothie,\nyou know, some good collagen powder, unsweetened coconut milk, and then some frozen berries.\nOr just you know, a butter collagen based coffee, butter collagen based tea. Or kinda\nlike my go-to is pretty simple, pretty easy. Yesterday we went out to eat in a restaurant\nnear us that we, I was able to get like an egg florentine, so it was like an eggs benedict\nwith over bacon and vegetable, and tomatoes. So it was like a really nice kinda lower carb,\ngood fats, good protein, tasted really good, felt good. I don\u2019t get a chance to do much\neggs benedict so when I go out, I\u2019m all over that. Evan Brand: Nice, we had a question here from\nJames. Happy Monday to you James. He says that, when we talk about gut health, what\norgans are we referring to besides the stomach? Dr. Justin Marchegiani: So when we look at\nthe intestinal track, right, we have a mouth, that connects to our esophagus, connect to\nour stomach, our stomach then connects to our small intestine, three parts of the small\nintestine duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, then down here at the\u2026 at this side, bottom right\nhand side. The ileum and the cecum meet up. This is where the colon starts, the colons\nup here, ascending, transverse, descending, sigmoid and then anus rectum. So, that\u2019s\nkinda your generalized intestinal track. Everything from mouth to esophagus to stomach to small\nintestine to large intestine to rectum, anus and out in the toilet, that\u2019s it. Evan Brand: Yeah, and then organs. So other\norgans we\u2019re referring to, gallbladder is a part of digestive process, pancreas. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Gallbladder and liver,\nits gonna be hanging out right here that dumps into the small intestine to be the duano hepatic\nampulla. That\u2019s a big one, splints more of a red blood cell kinda graveyard. Not much\nwith the splints Evan Brand: Pancreas. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Pancreas will help\nmore excrete whites with the enzymes, it wel help with the blood sugar component from the\ninsulin and glucagon. Evan Brand: Depending on how crazy your mealtime\nis. If youre one of those people, you know how many people I see driving on the highway\neating, stop doing that people. Eating sandwiches while theyre on the highway like trying to\nmerge on. Lady\u2019s got like a wrapper with a burger on her hand. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: The worst time to\nbe eating, I mean definitely fight-or-flight nervous system response. I hope they\u2019re\nat least doing some hydrochloric acid and enzymes but they\u2019re eating a sandwich. Probably\nnot there yet. Evan Brand: no, they are not there yet. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Exactly Evan Brand: Here\u2019s a question from Carol,\nshe said, love the idea of keeping the enzymes on the table. What company are you purchasing\nyour enzymes from? We have costume manufacturing, so we work with several professional health\ncare companies for practitioners, and they make special blend and products for us. So,\nyou could check out Justine\u2019s site, Just In health, Ge\u2019s got several different enzymes\non there, I do on my site EvanBrand.com as well. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Correct, yeah mine\u2019s\nenzyme synergy, HCL supreme, and then digest energy is kinda my lower dose enzyme hcl,\nblend I like those. Evan has\u2026 Evan, what\u2019s the name of yours? Evan Brand: Mine\u2019s pure digest. That\u2019s\nmy go to. That\u2019s the one that got dpp 4 in there for an accidental gluten exposure.\n200mg butane per capsule. Here\u2019s a question from Matt, ill be taking a trip to Greece\nsome time next year, definitely will take charcoal and enzymes, I\u2019m mostly worried\nwith water, all I drink is reverse osmosis. Do I just resort to bottled water?\nYeah, I mean I don\u2019t see an issue with bottles water. Or if you want something that\u2026 if\nyour just like super anti-plastic, you could do the berkey sport, the little blue bottle,\nI think I may be made of silicone but it\u2019s got the berky filter in there and you just\nout in your tap water and you can suck it up through the straw and as you\u2019re sucking\nto the straw, it pulls the water through the filter, now it\u2019s incredible and its relatively\ncheap too. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Yeah those were good.\nI don\u2019t have problem with drinking out of a plastic bottle it its you know, special\noccasion kind of thing. Like in general, like I was up in a bout this weekend and I rough\nlike a whole bunch of chiccos with me. So, I was able to do that, but sometimes it\u2019s\njust not convenient because I don\u2019t want the glass breaking, you know. O I don\u2019t\nwant the glass clanging around my ca from there. So sometimes I use that can, I use\nanother type of water sparkling brand or you know. I\u2019m typically doing fiji for a higher\nsilica, or I\u2019ll do the evy on for the high mineral content. I\u2019ll do that. The key thing\nis, just make sure you keep it out of the sun. if its plastic, you know. If im outside\ndrinking it, I have a back pack ang it goes right in the backpack afterwards. I don\u2019t\nwanna have it the sun\u2019s rays. My biggest concern with water is they just put it on\nthe pallet, leave it outside, let it sit in the sun. so typically, you know, you want\nit pulled inside right away because the UV Rays from the sun will cause the plastic to\ndeleach some of those estrogen compounds in the water. Evan Brand: Yeah, I trust like Wholefoods\nthe way they handle their stuff cuz if they get a truck full of fiji water, they\u2019re\ngonna unload the truck directly from the truck un the darkness and in to the store and then\nthe case of the water may even be inside of a cardboard box there where you are not getting\nthe sunlight to hit it. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Yeah. Wholefoods,\nin those stores they have\u2026 you can just see right. They have a smooth tracking containment\ninside the store. You\u2019re pretty darn safe cause its going from inside to outside or\ninside the store pretty smoothly. So that\u2019s at least a good option for it. So, I like\nthat. Evan Brand: Yep. We had a question here prom\nJudith, she says she has a H. Pylori. She can\u2019t get better and she\u2019s got pain constantly.\nShe\u2019s using matula tea, everything makes her tremor. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s talking\ntremor like T-R-E-M-O-R, but she spelled it tremor like a tremor for your hair, and anxiousness.\nSo, yeah I mean if you got H. pillory, obviously there\u2019s some random supplement that Justine\nand I both have that could help that. But really, you wanna be working with somebody\nwith this cause if you\u2019re in pain constantly and you\u2019re anxious, there could be some\nother things you need to do. We don\u2019t necessarily want to give you H. pylori herb or you may\nneed adrenal support and other things. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: There could be other\ninfections going on there. A lot of people who are going after gut infections, they don\u2019t\nhave the ability to regulate blood sugar and energy, and they tend to feel more anxious\nlike this. This is a common symptom that I see when people just go after the gut and\ndon\u2019t fix the other things first. Evan Brand: Yeah. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: So, this is a common\nside effect. This is why we really wanna have a comprehensive program lined up and not just\nspot treat people with a gut bug. Sometimes you can do that when people are in really\nreally really really good health and their infections are more acute. You can totally\ndo that. But in more something chronic, in a more other fatigue harder issues are in\nplay, you really have to line things up and a really systematic approach to get the best\nresults. Evan Brand: Yep. Yeah. Well said. So, Oliver\nask; Do you guys tolerate raw milk kefir? I don\u2019t do any. I probably tolerate it;\nI just don\u2019t do it. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: I don\u2019t do well.\nI had a patient get me a gown of like really awesome super high quality grass fed pastored\nmilk and I\u2019d still have a lot of dhiarhea from it. So, im just like, its not worth it\nfor me. The only dairy that I can do well is yea and butter and then if I do kefir,\nits gonna be coconut based, I\u2019ll do coconut based kefir. Evan Brand: Yeah, its just not worth it for\nme to try so, I just don\u2019t. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Exactly. Suzanne writes;\nWhat can I do to fight hunger cravings. I do not eat after 5 pm but I wake up crazy\nhungry. I drink a lot of lemon water with some Himalayan salt. So, yeah. You probably need to be eating a\nlittle bit latter. If you\u2019re going to bed around 10-11, that\u2019s you know, 5-6 hours\nbefore going to bed with out food. So, there could be some blood sugar instability happening.\nSo, if you\u2019re walking up at night, you may wanna have a nice, little, simple snack, protein\nand fat by your nightstand and try eating with in 2 hours before bed. Again, if we\u2019re\nhaving blood sugar issues and those sugar issues are waking you up, that\u2019s the next\nlogical step. Evan Brand: Yeah, may need some adrenal support,\nyou may need some kromium, you could throw some cinnamon on a baked sweet potato with\nbutter. Have that for dinner that may stabilize the blood sugar a little bit too. I really\nreally love using kromium and other minerals to help so, there\u2019s herbs that you can use\ntoo. There are some like glucose, modulating glucose control herbs that we use, but once\nagain, that\u2019s something that you don\u2019t wanna guess and check on. You gotta get to\nthe root cause. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: And then Carol writes\nin; Are your products that you mentioned safe for 2 years old and up?\nIt depends, most 2-year-old cant swallow pills that are in our product so we have special\ntincture that are liquid based and they tend to be easier to dose. So, we can dose them.\nWe like the tinctures for the younger people. Evan Brand: there are couple chewable products\nwe used for kids too that kinda depending on what it is. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Your talking chewable\nfor actually like clearing herbs? Evan Brand: Uhh no. I\u2019m talking for digestion. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: For enzymes stuff. Evan Brand: Yeah, chewable enzymes. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Yep. Evan Brand: Chewable aloes, things like that. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Yep. There\u2019s some\nDGL and and aloe up there I\u2019ve seen and then there are some enzymes that chewable\nthat are good. Evan Brand: I know. For killing, no. I don\u2019t\nknow of anything that can kill that\u2019s chewable. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Exactly. There are\npump based that I like and then dropper ones that are dropped based. Then you can kinda\ndial that dosage up. So those are the ones we typically like and we can dose it up better.\nJust more individualized. Evan Brand: Judith had a question. She said;\ncan I call on the phone please? You know that, what that makes me think off?\nThat makes me think we should have like a call in podcast where people can call in and\ntalk and tell their questions on you know, like on the air so to speak, like a radio.\nThat would be fun. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Yeah. Evan Brand: I don\u2019t know how we do it. Im\nsure there\u2019s a way. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Yeah. Im open to that.\nFor sure I think I need some kind of a call board and plud it into my computer. Something\nwe can look at. Anyone has information on it, let us know. We\u2019ll put it in a queue. Evan Brand: That would be fun. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Couple more questions,\nGeorge writes in. hey George hpe you\u2019re doing well. I tipically do ashwagandha to\ndry herbs versus the tincture. Ashwagandha and tincture taste absolutely horrid especially\nif you take wrong ashwagandha. One of the worst tasting herbs next to tribulus. Evan Brand: I do ashwagandha and tincture\nactually with the sooth formula, the adrenal sooth formula I do and I mean\u2026 Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Blend? Evan Brand: Yeah it is a blend. I mean it\ndoes have; well it has motherwort in it which is equally. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: There\u2019s liquorish\ntoo? Evan Brand: Uhh. No there\u2019re no liquorish.\nIts ashwagandha, rishi, motherwort, ziziphus, albizzia. Its pretty horrid. I have a lot\nof clients who like \u201cI just can\u2019t do it\u201d. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Okay. Yeah yeah yeah\nyeah yeah. But there\u2019s a blend. But if you do ashwagandha 2 to 1, meaning 2 times the\namount of herbs to the alcohol\u2019s in there, most people do like awanda 2 or awanda 5.\nSo, its literally 5 to 10 times less potent. It\u2019s not even close. But when you really\ndo 2 to 1, it\u2019s like holy god! Its crazy. Evan Brand: Oh man. Judith, how can you contact\nus. So, Justine, you can reach Justine at his site, Justinhealth.com. there\u2019s a scheduling\nbutton if you need to schedule a call or there\u2019s also contact information if you just wanna\nemail. Let\u2019s see what else here. Me, my site, Evanbrand.com,\nsame thing. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Yep. Evan Brand: Do you wanna answer this one here\nfrom Christian? Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Yup. 9 months ago,\nI was diagnosed with candida, came up 40 on my oats test, feeling a lot better and got\nrid of it, lost too much weight, how can I gain back the weight and not look sick? So,\nfirst thing first. Not to be a wise guy, but you have to make sure you\u2019re eating enough.\nThat\u2019s number 1. You have to make sure you\u2019re getting enough calories. Sometime when people\ndo a lot of killing, that killing can actually decrease the appetite. So you have to actually\nrun your food cronometer. Justinhealth.com/cronometer, make sure you\u2019re getting enough calories,\nnumber 1. Number 2, if you\u2019re more of an ectomorph or its hard for you to gain weight,\nyou also have to look at your macro nutrient ratio. Ratio a protein fat carbs and increases\nthe percentage of your carbs. So, if you\u2019re 30 of 40 percent go to 50 of 60 percent. And\nstill try to make sure you\u2019re doing grain free based carbs. Don\u2019t get extra grains\nin there just to get more carbs. Do more squash, sweet potato, plantains, you know those kinds\nof things instead. Evan Brand: You know what I\u2019m gonna say\nbased on his comment, right. I\u2019m gonna say there\u2019s probably more than just candida,\nyou know. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Yeah, and if you\u2019re\nfeeling better and you\u2019ve gotten retest, that\u2019s great. But you would also wanna get\na high-quality gut test on because the oat will not look out the parasites. It won\u2019t\nget the parasite. It will look out bacteria and fungal metabolize and that\u2019s it. Evan Brand: its extremely rare. I mean who\never they say 9 months ago they were diagnose with candida. Who ever diagnosed you with\nthat, I mean I can legaly diagnose anyway, but I would be very very suspicious that you\nhad just candida. Its very rare to see. I guarantee theres probably maybe some parasite,\nbacterial overgrowth, h. pillory. Something else going one cause I feel like candida\u2019s\nusually kinda late to the party where as the bacteria and the low HCL from the h. pillory\nand the parasite, those kinda disrupt the gut and then I feel like candida moves in.\nI guess it could happen. Chicken or egg, who cares. But I feel like candida is a secondary\nissue to a primary parasite. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Exactly and tipicallt\nthe timing of how we treat. We tipically do the h. pillory first, parasite, bacteria,\n2nd or 3rd and then candida last. That\u2019s kinda the general way in which we treat, Robert.\nHope that helps. Evan Brand: Yeah, Robert\u2019s question for\nthose listening, he had a question on what should you go after first. Candida or sibo?\nI mean honestly, a lot of the herbs used tho have multiple properties that we may use blends\nof herbs that are anti-microbial and anti-fungal so you kinda killing 2 birds in 1 stone. But\nI guess it depends on the serenity of one issue we may use more inti fungal as a posting,\nanti-microbial if its parasites who may have parasitic herbs that could kill fungus. So,\nits really just case by case basis. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Totally. And I thank\nGuererro about this zoom meeting thing. Ill keep that in mind, I think its good. Matt\nwrites in; Would there ever be any benefit to not save carbs for the evening? So, meaning\nto do your carbs in the morning. So, that\u2019s like kinda common sense where lot of people\nload up carbs in the morning. Again some of the data suggest in the carb back loading\ncommunity that better at night. There\u2019s also some data that some people tend to sleep\nbetter with a little it of carbs in their system at night. Also tends to help with fat\nburning and such. So, I tipically always, lets just say lean lean on the carb back loading\nmindset but always tested out. I mean there\u2019s data out there but then you gotta use your\nclinical experience. So test it out to see how you do and see how you feel. Evan Brand: Yeah, I got a question from Jac.\nShould one take probiotics daily? I mean that\u2019s like such an open-ended question.\nI mean we could spend an hour on that subject. We probably have spent hours on it. I\u2019m\nkanda on and on face right now with probiotics. I\u2019m doing some special probiotics blends\nto help lower regulate histamine. And them I\u2019m also doing some saccharomyces boulardii.\nSo, I\u2019m doing those daily for probably months, but now with my daughter I sicle her on and\noff probiotics, throwing some saccharomyces. It\u2019s kinda just depends on what you\u2019re\ndoing. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Correct, correct.\nNow in general about people taking herbs between meals, couple things to say about that is,\nI use to say like do your herbs hundred percent before food, which I think is great. You typically\ntake at least five minutes before food. the problem is you get a lot of patients that\nare like they forget, and they just won\u2019t do it. Then they\u2019ll forget half a time so\nthen half a time they\u2019ll never taking the herbs. So, my perspective is ideally five,\nfive minutes or more is fine especially you\u2019re not getting nauseous, but if you forget, still\nhave it. Like still have it, always do it. Eating your food and forgetting is not an\nexcuse to not take it. I always try to draw that line with patients and if the patients\nare more sensitive, we\u2019ll typically do it with food anyway just so it mixes in and it\u2019s\na little bit less potent as well. Evan Brand: Yeah, the question Justin was\nanswering was should you take herbs between meals or with meals. I would say amino acids.\nThat wasn\u2019t the question but just to overeducate people. Amino acids, we\u2019ll like to have\nthose on empty stomach cause they can peak. But hers, I like herbs with meal and a lot\nof gut killing protocols we do the herbs are suggested with meals. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Yes, exactly. Evan Brand: I think that were different question\nunless you saw more then we can kinda circle back to the food poisoning thing and then\ntalk about testing real quick and wrap it up. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: I appreciate Judith\u2019s\ncomment as well. I got a question here from Facebook from Dawn. Dawn hope you\u2019re doing\nwell. What type of protein powder do you recommend for smoothies? So, Dawn, for like auto immune\nkinda template, we typically lean more on just plain collagen, or just plain P protein.\nSo those are the big ones that will do if we\u2019re just kinda be on more auto immune\nside, and then typically gotta low sugar berries, ripe berries, blue berries, raspberries, they\ncan be frozen, and then some unsweetened coconut milk tends to be a pretty good shake option.\nAnd then in my line I do the true collagen to the true P and then I have one called the\ntrue keto collagen, which is a really good collagen-based smoothie that sweetened with\nvanilla and cinnamon and that is still autoimmune approved. It got some MCT oil, I added some\ntaurine in there and a couple more amino acids and coconut colostrum. So, that one\u2019s a\nreally good one and it mixes awesome with unsweetened coconut milk. Evan Brand: Nice, I mean I\u2019ve not had\u2026\nmany people have issues with hemp. Hemp protein. A good organic hemp protein could be okay.\nSome people don\u2019t like, feel like they digested as well as the P, but I feel okay with hemp. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Yeah, I mean if someone\u2019s\non autoimmune, I would say no. but if they\u2019ve been able to kinda re introduce nuts and seeds,\nand they\u2019re doing good then I think its fine. I don\u2019t have a problem with that. Evan Brand: Okay. So, circling back if you\u2019re\nready. Circle back to the conversation, we started about the food poisoning and going\nput to restaurants and travelling and all that. We talked about kind of preparation\nkit of having your binders like your charcoal, your soothing gut nutrients, like maybe your\naloe, and your glutamine. You mentioned using some of your GI Clear 4 and 5 products with\nlike berberine and anti-microbial herbs like oregano oil and then I would just say doing\na once a year testing on your gut system, My daughter just turned 3 over the weekend,\nand we\u2019ve already done 5 stool tests on her. She\u2019s not even 3 years old yet. But\nthat\u2019s cause she has a lot of issues on het stool. So, she had h. pylori, then we\ngot rid of it. Then had 2 parasites, then we got rid of those. Then she had a bunch\nof bacterial overgrowth, then we addressed that. Then she had candida, now we\u2019re working\non that. So, man it\u2019s been a, it\u2019s been a ringer what she\u2019d gone thru. So, for her,\nwe\u2019re doing more often than once a year for testing, but I would look getting an organic\nacid urine test we\u2019re on. And we\u2019re often running that through a mycotox screen now\nwhere we can look at mold toxins for people, because diarrhea and abdominal pain can be\ncaused by mold, by mycotoxins. So, we\u2019re running that now cause sometimes we find people\ndon\u2019t have gut infections, but they have mold that\u2019s why their body is creating diarrhea\ncause they\u2019re trying to flush out toxins. So, doing the urine once a year would be a\ngood idea and then doing the stool test, we like to use GI Map stool test. We often use\nthat one. And that\u2019s a DNA-based one where we can look at all the different infections\npeople have. We can look at your inflammation to determine well, is it the infection, is\nit the inflammation, is it both. How\u2019s your pancreatic enzymes function look. Are you\neating and reacting to gluten? How\u2019s that look. How\u2019s your fat digestion look. We\ncan get all those pieces of data. Just really at the end of the day a lot of people have\nthese great questions here. But a lot of questions are\u2026 they\u2019re too general, and really you\nneed a clinical data. You need to see the answer... the question, do I need probiotics\ndaily. Well, I don\u2019t know. Why don\u2019t we look at your bacteria flora, and if you\u2019re\nlow across the board, the answer would be yes. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: One hundred percent.\nSo in general for everyone who\u2019s travelling and has a food poisoning issue or wants to\nbe careful, it could be a food poisoning where food poisoning could mean like there\u2019s just\nmold in the food, there could be some E. coli in there. Then you upgrade to like infections\nlike h pylori and actual parasites, there could be a little bit longer lasting that\naren\u2019t gonna go away at night and then you obviously have food allergens and the inflammation\nfrom food allergens. Whether its glute, whether it\u2019s the junkie vegetable oils, MSG, those\nkinda thing. So, typically the charcoal, the enzymes, the HCL are great for binding up\nthe bad foods and maybe the infections. If you have the issues and they\u2019re acute, you\nwanna hit the GI Clear 4, GI Clear 5, oil of oregano, Goldenseal, higher dose or berberine.\nThose things are gonna be great. Higher dose probiotics lactobacillus bifidobacter, enzyme,\nHCL, activated charcoal with the food at that point. We do not worry about taking charcoal\nbefore meals when we are eating questionable foods or when we are sick. We try to bind\nthings up. And prevent excessive diarrhea and such. Evan Brand: Yeah there was a question earlier\nabout like a shilajit and fulvic acids. I used a product that has charcoal and fulvic\nacid in it and shilajit as well. And its from Beyond Balance that\u2019s a practitioner company.\nYou need a practitioner to order that. But it\u2019s a product that we use called tox-e\nbind. And it\u2019s a binder. Very very helpful. So I\u2019m using that personally and have a\nreally good experience with it. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Exactly, I love that.\nVery good. Well today was a great chat, man. Excellent. If you guys enjoying the podcast,\nmake sure you head over to Evanbrand.com. Evan\u2019s got some great information there.\nReally good stuff. Justinhealth.com as well to reach out to me. And of course, you can\nschedule consult with Evan and myself if you want to dive in deeper. And if you\u2019re enjoying\nthis guys, smash the like button, hit the share, hit that bell so you get notifications.\nWe appreciate connecting with you all and we will be back next week. You guys have a\nphenomenal day, talk soon. Evan Brand: Take care. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Take care, Evan. Bye. Evan Brand: Bye.", "IOBS-mWbpZo": "hello everyone this is Sarah Marie one of the registered dieticians with the villages health today we will be presenting on decoding the Nutrition Facts label so we're going to be diving into this little label that we all see on the back of most of our foods that we have so we're gonna do an overview of the components of the Nutrition Facts label talk about why the label is relevant some label updates so you might have noticed that the label was updated as of 2020 we're gonna break down the the label so going into every component of the Nutrition Facts label going into some health claims too so that is them those claims that you might see on the front of the label Delvin what those actually mean and then how to actually apply the label to your life so what to actually take away from learning more about the Nutrition Facts label the Nutrition Facts label tells us how much in of what so it tells us about the food that we're looking at the serving sizes looked serving the percent daily value per serving and the nutrients per serving as well the macro mic micronutrients are included not everything is listed on there but we'll dive more into that in just a moment here um this also includes the new the ingredient list so the ingredients was part of the Nutrition Facts label so why is the label relevant why do we have this like I just said it tells us how much and of what of the foods that we're looking at and it has been required in some form since 1994 so it was developed originally in the 90s and it was developed to may help us make more healthy and more informed food choices so we want to know what we're actually eating and this tells us and it's required on most prepared foods except with no significant nutrition value so coffee is spices things like that teas you won't see it listed on those foods because there's no significant nutritional value whereas like coffee and tea you might see caffeine listed that's a requirement but Nutrition Facts label there is standard form like I said they came up with the original form in the 1990s and then they did just update it and in 2020 so we'll go into that more in just a moment as well this is the standard Nutrition Facts label that you probably recognize that's the standard format that they came out in 1994 and it does break down the serving size in servings per container and then you'll see everything that we just mentioned briefly and we'll go more into that in just a second here you can see the difference between the old label and the new label a new label for the FDA company has had to release this by 2020 with a few exceptions but in general 2020 they have to roll out this new label you can see some huge differences that are pretty obvious here I think the calories is pretty much shouting at everyone right now the calories is much bigger and bolder another bigger bolder area is that serving size those servings per container and serving said do you want to pay attention Jill and they tried to make that a little bit more obvious for people too so to give an example here the serving size at this boot is 2/3 of a cup so that would be the volume measurement and then they have the weighted measurement right beside that as 55 grams so if you were to weigh out 2/3 of a cup of this food it would weigh 55 grams on your scale so that's just giving you another unit to look at if you don't have that measuring cup if you have a scale that's a great way to get some accurate idea of what a serving size of this food looks like and then everything has broken down in the amount per serving below this so for 8 servings per container 1/8 of this food this food product or 2/3 of a cup or 55 grams of this food you're looking at 230 calories and you can see here that the calories from fat were actually removed on the new food label so like I said in the 90s when the original food label was developed and you know the big fad and the 90s was low fact everything in ideas but we realized not that bad and we'll go into that more in just a second - so you can see you know there's really no purpose for that calories from fat there it really wasn't doing anything beneficial for our health so they went ahead and remove that and it made more room for us to put the calories a lot bigger and bolder say we can see that that's really important to some other changes just moving down on the list the fat stays the same cholesterol sodium total carbohydrates still listed there dietary fiber is still listed and then you can see sugars so this is a little bit of a typo on this it's supposed to say twelve sugars the twelve grams of sugar here on the left as it does up here on the right but that's just a little typo but you can see in the new food label you can see total sugars listed and then includes however many grams from added sugar that's a new line there so we can see for this food from the twelve grams of total sugar that's in the food ten grams of that is from added sugar ten grams of the sugar is dumped in by the manufacturer there's only two grams of natural sugar in this food product this is really helpful to tell us the quality of the food that we're actually looking at protein stayed the same and then a couple of them minerals and vitamins here on the bottom changed they took off bought a vitamin A and vitamin C and they added vitamin D and potassium so back when they came up with the food label in the 90s most Americans were actually deficient or at least many Americans were actually deficient in vitamin A and vitamin E that's actually not the case anymore that with so many rare foods are fortified that's actually not it relevant so they removed those and they added something more relevant to us vitamin A and potassium I mean vitamin D and potassium those are minerals and vitamins that most Americans are actually deficient and now so we really would like to focus on those trying to make sure people are getting added calcium and iron are still listed many people are still deficient in calcium and iron in a daily basis so those are still listed there another difference that you might see is that confusing chart on the bottom left there completely removed no one really paid attention to that part so they went ahead and removed it it was really just taking up a lot of space that we can use for other things so that's something we like to see gone you might also notice some differences in the percent daily values that are listed there those percent daily values are still based on a 2,000 calorie per day diet but they did change some of the recommended daily allowances for people so we'll go into that more in just a second too but just something to note there and that's just an overview of the differences we have here at larger bolder serving size larger and bolder calorie is updated percent daily values they added added sugars to the foods they change some of the nutrients also change that put out there as I said the serving size is different here we can see the difference here but their serving size is the primary place that we should look when we're looking at the food label and to note it is developed by the manufacturer some foods there is a standard serving size but it is just a serving size it's not the portion that you necessarily would eat at that food so you definitely want to pay attention to the serving size and servings per container initially and think about how much of it you would actually eat the serving size is not always realistic to what you would actually eat of that food so pay attention to that part first and take into account ok I would actually make 2 servings out of this 8 serving per container box or whatever it might be just be really really honest with yourself and think about how much of that food you would actually eat because like I said it's developed by the manufacturers now by consumers so think about how much of the food you would actually eat and take that into account because everything below is based on that serving size that they list right here serving sizes with the new food label as well they did change some foods that many people would eat the whole thing up or they would eat you know fewer or they would eat more servings of than listed on the food label they tried to make things a little bit more realistic which is appreciated by many consumers you know a lot of times a pint of ice cream people will make three servings out of it some people make one serving out of it but they did change they are starting to change the serving sizes to be more relevant to how people actually eat their food you may notice many foods that look like they may be a single serving bag they would say there's actually four servings in there or two servings in there so now they will mostly list for a certain that they recommend and for the whole container which is really helpful they're also doing this with many beverages so instead of if you buy a 16 ounce soda or something instead of listing two servings for the container and they'll often list that's how many people would actually consume that so it's allowing people to make more informed decisions in that way and moving down on the food label you have the calories listed here first and this is that amount per serving that's why that serving size is so important but what is calories calories is simply the energy that you would receive from that food how much energy that food would provide to you so where is that energy coming from it's coming from the facts the carbohydrates and the proteins from their foods so calories are actually calculated from the fat carbohydrates and protein that are in the food that you're looking at if you're having anything with alcohol in it alcohol also is a source of calories but that's not often the case when we're eating food that for instance has nine calories per gram carbohydrates and protein both have four calories per gram so you can actually calculate how many calories are in your food without looking at the calories of top if you have the carbohydrates protein and we'll go into that more a little bit later as well which I like to call it the calorie game I think it's fun so the 2,000 calorie per day is that it is that rents amount for everything that you'll see on the food label list so just keep that in mind there are many other things that take an account when you're calculating how many calories someone needs the typical person may or may not need 2,000 calories per day you know a teenager boy who's very active versus an older petite woman very different calorie needs you definitely want to take into and to account other things like your age your activity level your height your weight your frame and your health goals are you trying to gain weight or lose weight or what are you actually trying to do with your health so this percent daily value is based on that 2,000 calorie per day recommendation so it's like I said not not accurate for everyone to go off of this 2,000 calories per day especially about you confusing for people which is why I always encourage people to pay attention to the actual amounts listed in the food and know what their goals actually are so this percent daily value not the most accurate thing it's just kind of to give a reference for okay this is how much a 2,000 calories per day diet would be maybe maybe that is what's recommended for you maybe you're shooting for more or less but just take that again to account this percent daily value can be confusing moving down on the food label list right after your calories you'll see fat listed that is listed into total fat and then you have saturated fat and trans fat listed from those fats you also have cholesterol down there um so total fat you have 8 grams of total fat in this food for instance and you have 1 gram of saturated fat zero grams from trans fats but it doesn't quite add up to the total fat does it so you have to Grande zero grams of trans fats where the other 7 grams of fat coming from the 7 grams of fat that are not listed on this food are going to be coming from unsaturated fats so those are gonna be our poly and monounsaturated fats they are not required to be listed on the food label some manufacturers will listed on the food labels but it's not required so many do not list it at all that's just something to keep in mind there are unsaturated factor are more heart-healthy fats or more cardioprotective facts so they are definitely not something that we necessarily want to avoid so just keep in mind it's kind of the warning facts that we have listed on here we have the total fat which can include the healthy fats you have the saturated fat so one gram of saturated fat you may want to limit your saturated fat the general recommendation is 20 grams is less than 20 grams of saturated fat per day but if you do have any kind of heart disease or are at risk of having heart disease the recommendation is lower increasing your daily recommended amount of fat did increase but this latest food release food label release and that increased from 65 grams to 78 grams per day so you will see that the percentage here increased as well so they went from 12 percent of your recommended amount to 10 percent of your recommended amount and that's because of the increase in the recommended amount for a typical American the trans fats you do want to avoid trans fat so you would hope to see zero there and actually as of 2020 they are not allowed to roll out and you that has trans fats in it so largely these trans fats are going to be coming from foods in our diet that do not have the food label there or maybe you're going to a restaurant and it's being created and we can go more into that in just a minute as well cholesterol you'll see here this is dietary cholesterol most dietary cholesterol actually get in the colon before it actually hits our bloodstream so if you're trying to lower your cholesterol levels in your blood your LDL cholesterol specifically going for that dietary cholesterol is not necessarily going to be so helpful if you're eating an adequate amount of fiber in your diet you moreso want to limit the saturated fats in your diet if you're trying to manage your cholesterol those good fats like I was mentioning those unsaturated fats those are gonna be our mono and our polyunsaturated fats our polyunsaturated fats are where we get our omega-3 fatty acids there's really heart-healthy fats that we love those are gonna be coming largely from RE fatty fish like our tuna and our salmon sardines as well walnuts are actually the highest nuts in omega-3 fatty acid so a very heart healthy for us monounsaturated fats are also cardioprotective those are gonna be things like our olive oil or vegetable oils our nut butters like peanut and almond butter and avocados are also very high in mono apart healthy fats and and we don't like to pick on those very much saturated fats like I was saying the ABA the American Diabetes Association and the American Heart Association recommend no more than seven percent of your total calories per day coming from your saturated fats so if you are if you do have any kind of high blood pressure or are at risk of developing heart disease you want to avoid eating more than 57% of your your calories from saturated fats per day so if you were on a 2,000 calorie per day diet may be shooting for less than 15 grams it's not treated fat in any day the saturated fats are largely coming from our dairy products those whole milk dairy products so cheese milk whole fat yogurt and then this fatty meats our animal meats like bacon sausage pepperonis some cold cuts those are the fattier cold cuts but many going to be high in fat premiums butters margarine palm and oil and a lot of hydrogenated oils are going to be high in saturated fat so I like to think about the tropical oils as being higher in saturated fats almond and coconut oil or high in saturated fats and then if you do see hydrogenated oil on your food label those are typically going to be big sources of saturated fats as well trans fatty acids those are really coming from partially hydrogenated oil so their oils that have been heated and disfigured in some way oftentimes they're a lot more shelf stable so they're stable at room temperature so if you look at your ingredients list and you see partially hydrogenated oils that foods going to contain trans fats but it has been required to be taken out of circulation added as of January 1st of this year so it's actually should not be in circulation anymore they're linked to a bunch of negative health effects in our body it increases our body stores of fat it increases insulin resistance increases inflammation and LDL cholesterol that's that lousy cholesterol it's been linked to decreasing our good cholesterol that HDL cholesterol and it's often found in in processed foods those relationships stable foods like like things like Twinkies that don't go bad forever or things like like a stick margarine so steak margarine is stable at room temperature it doesn't melt at all and that's because of those trans fatty acids that are typically they're very shelf stable margarine on the other hand it's gonna be more heart-healthy they don't put they don't make trans fatty acids in there because it doesn't need to be stable and in a stick form at room temperature but many shortenings are going to be high in trans fatty acids like lard fast foods or anything that you might get thats fried at a restaurant it's gonna be happy just thinking about how often they actually change that fry oil trans fatty acids can occur when food when oil is overheated or heated many times so if you're buying fried food if you're getting french fries from a restaurant think about how often they might actually be changing that oil out it could have been heated a number of times between the time that they originally poured it to the point that is actually on your plate so a there could easily be trans fatty acids in that fried food and these are just more reasons to avoid those trans fatty acids especially so it like the bodies tends to store it way more often it increases insulin resistance which can affect your blood sugar control and increases inflammation which is going to damage all of the soft blood tissues of your body and it does does decrease your HDL cholesterol that good cholesterol that we like to see higher in the blood and it has been linked to raising your LDL cholesterol and your triglycerides so we do not like to want to avoid that if we can't no diem is going to be the next thing you see on your food label the recommended daily value for the typical American is 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day so this is just for a typical American without heart without a blood pressure or any kind of heart disease so many Americans actually need to be on a low-sodium diet because of those comorbidities so thinking about what might be recommended for you in your specific situation a low sodium diet is considered 1,500 to 2,000 milligrams of sodium per day so that percent daily value on the side there is not going to be applicable to you if you are to follow a low-sodium diet just to give you a comparison a typical American is eating about 3,600 milligrams of sodium a day so we're way over the recommended amount even if you don't have any kind of high blood pressure or heart disease so just something to keep in mind there and it is listed for serving so 160 milligrams per serving of this food and we do want to pay attention to this one because most of our sodium is coming from our process and pre-prepared foods it's not always coming from the salt shaker but to give you an idea one teaspoon salt does have 2300 milligrams in sodium that's the whole amount of daily value for his typical American so if a recipe calls for one teaspoon of salt thinking about you're adding your whole day's worth of salt right there into the recipe how much of that food are you actually going to eat is just a mineral and it is a major part of our table salt that we have so sodium chloride is table salt so sodium is a huge part of that obviously like I said most Americans are eating too much sodium in their diet and that's largely coming from those process in pre-prepared foods not necessarily the salt shaker but if you do need to reduce your sodium intake getting rid of that salt shaker is going to be a step in the right direction trying to use other herbs and spices in your foods even different methods of preparation can help to release those natural flavors from our grilling can help to release some natural flavors without having to add too much more sodium too much more salt to your food or a general American we all need to eat less salt so label reading oftentimes you'll see it advertised foods advertised as low sodium or very low sodium or reduce sodium what it is actually mean those are actually regulated terms that they put on the food labels so some things very low sodium those are typically going to be something that's pretty natural in form it's gonna be probably be a whole foods like a piece of vegetable like asparagus or something like that very low sodium means it has 35 milligrams of sodium or less per serving so that's a very low sodium food a low sodium food has a hundred and forty milligrams or less per serving just to give you perspective a food label that we were just looking at how to 160 milligrams of sodium per serving so not quite low sodium but pretty close reduced sodium is when you want to be wary about you do want to look at the food label for this one to see sodium it's actually in that food because reduced sodium simply means that the food is reduced by 25% of the sodium than the original food product so the original can of soup say had a thousand milligrams of sodium per serving then reduced sodium variety still has 750 milligrams of sodium so still a very high sodium food but it is less than the original product so they can advertise this being nice and it's a quick tip that some people like to use if salts listed in the first five ingredients it's probably too high in sodium I like to just look at the actual amount of sodium that you have in the food it gives you a better idea of exactly what you're looking at when you're eating out or if you if you are dining out at all it can be helpful to try to see how you can modify that food product on your own if you're going to a chain they actually have to post the nutrition information online so you can actually look up how much sodium is in the food that you are planning to eat before you actually go the chain that you're going to nutrition so say like Olive Garden nutrition just put that into your search engine and it will often come up with a PDF or some kind of interactive menu that you can click along and see how many milligrams of sodium is actually in your food product you can also see the calories and carbohydrates everything like that listed there as well so a very helpful tool to use if you have the capabilities of doing that or you go out to eat if you don't then you can always see how you can make modifications on your own to asking for sauces or dressing on the side is always going to be an improvement that's typically where a large amount of the salt is going to be lying for your foods so if there is any kind of barbecue sauce on your food maybe you can get that barbecue sauce on the side there's dressing with your salad I try to get that dressing on the side that way you can actually moderate how much of that is actually going on to your food oftentimes restaurants will really cover that food in the dressing or the sauce so can help you to be more moderate in that way also thinking about some other things that might do tongs or something that you can do without any kind of crunchy little things those are typically going to be higher in sodium if you can do without that you can easily reduce the amount of sodium that you're actually eating there you know it's not going to make low-sodium food necessarily but you can at least make an improvement carbohydrates are the next things listed on our foods here your total carbohydrates listed there so carbohydrates are made up of sugar starch and fiber so when they say total carbohydrates that's including all three of those different components there but again this really isn't adding up here so you have 37 grams total grams of total carbohydrates in this food 7 grams from fiber and 12 grams from sugar so the other 21 grams of carbs in this food is going to be coming from starch they do not have to list starch on the food label they typically do not so you just keep that in mind when you're looking at the total carbohydrates it won't add up there and that's because starch is not listed on the food label fiber that you see there the dietary fiber most Americans are not getting an adequate amount of fiber during the day the standard daily value is 28 grams per day and this does vary by country some countries are up to 40 grams of fiber per day as their recommendation so we're on the lower end and most Americans typically aren't even hitting that much so we do want to try to increase the fiber where we can we do want to increase it slowly though increasing your fiber all at once can cause GI distress so increasing your fiber slowly and then making sure you're drinking plenty of water with that as well because it can cause constipation if you're not drinking adequate amounts of water and increasing your fiber intake the sugar is listed there as I mentioned earlier on they added the added sugar so we can see that there's no recommendation for total sugar in the diet but there is a recommendation for added sugar and that doesn't mean that we want to necessarily hit all 100 gram that 100% of our added sugar that's just to give you an idea we don't want to go over that 100% of that recommended amount so for an average American this standard value is 50 grams but you look at somewhere like the American Heart Association their recommendation is somewhere between 25 and 36 grams of added sugar per day so a lot less than the standard daily value that they're listing here however the typical American consumes more than 82 grams of shadowed sugar per day so we are far exceeding even that's higher and spectrum of recommended amount of sugar so like I was saying this can tell us about the the quality of the food product that we're looking at so it is very helpful to pay attention for that part right there I do you like this addition to the food label so where are carbohydrates coming from our sugary foods like our fruit fructose is the primary carbohydrate there it's a sugar it's our fruit sugar so this is coming from frozen fruit fresh fruit fruit dried or fruit juice milk also is the source of sugar in the form of lactose so that's another carbohydrate there yogurt just like milk art um lactose is going to be the primary sugar there unless they're flavoring it in some way so trying to go for the more plain yogurt so if you can Greek yogurt it's gonna have some protein there as well so it's gonna have a little bit more protein than your standard yogurt so a nice slower absorption of those carbohydrates then if you just did a regular yogurt starchy foods are going to be things like our pasta our breads and our bagels any kind of breads foods pancakes waffles rice starchy vegetables like potatoes peas corn beans crackers are also gonna be starchy foods as well just to give you an idea where our carbohydrate we do want to go for the more quality carbohydrates so going for those whole fruits and whole vegetables if we can going for whole grains when possible as well so looking at your bread ingredient list and trying to make sure that the first ingredient there is going to be a whole grain so whole is the word that we're looking for to start out the ingredients so it's important to look at that there these foods are going to be higher in fiber and they're gonna have a slower rate of absorption which is gonna give us more sustained energy it's gonna help to keep us full longer oftentimes these food are up foods are off actually higher in water content as well so they're gonna have more volume help to keep us cool they're gonna help to keep us more hydrated these foods are gonna be a much more beneficial than empty carbohydrates here these are going to be more sugary foods more processed foods cookies ice cream cake and e-chips these are going to be more processed and they're going to be lower so when we want carbohydrates we want to get the best quality carbohydrates that we can get they want the higher fiber carbohydrates so looking at your food label list and seeing the fiber contact comparing it out with the foods that you're looking at going for the high fiber when you can like I said you don't want to increase that fiber overnight if this is where you typically get your carbohydrates from you don't want to just swap over to the other list without increasing your water intake and being prepared for any kind of GI distress being acutely aware of any kind of GI distress that you might be feeling and taking that into account so what is fiber fiber is the indigestible or hard to digest part of our plant foods some of it most of it is passed through the intestines without being digested but we do have got bacteria that actually can help just to break down that fiber as well so giving us more energy in that way these foods are higher and in a lot of micronutrients and vitamins like vitamin E and magnesium so we love these fiber rich so so we want to aim for around 25 to 35 grams of fiber per day and we can actually see these sometimes listed on the food label as an excellent source of fiber if they're if they have 5 grams of fiber or more and then a good source of fiber if they have two point five to four point nine grams of fiber so going for those excellent and good sources of fiber but you can always just flip the food around or go for those old foods and like I said fiber does contribute to our digestive help it helps us to stay regular helps to prevent any diarrhea or constipation it can help us to feel full and satisfied after eating so these are the way we want to go if possible the next thing on your food label that you'll see is protein and you'll see that there is no percent daily value listed for protein and that's because this does vary so much per person getting enough protein so it's really not too much of a concern most Americans want to get at least 50 grams of protein per day adult adult Americans want to get at least 50 grams of protein a day depending on their activity level this may increase it might decrease slightly but in general about 50 grams of protein per day is the minimum amount that you want to get where our proteins coming from of course they're coming largely from our animal products and then from some some vegetable sources as well so it they are really important to help us build muscle repair muscle tissue they're important for every cell in our body and proteins do have a much slower absorption rate than our carbohydrates so if they're absorbed for about 4 to 6 hours from our stomach our bloodstream verses carbohydrates being absorbed but in about one to two hours so if you're looking for something to keep you cool for a while try to have something balanced with a little bit of protein there it'll help to slow down the absorption give you a more steady blood sugar rise and fall and they're an important they're a standard serving of protein it's going to be a three ounce serving which is about the size of a deck of cards some people like to compare that to their palm so if you have a deck of cards here that to the sides of your palm you know our palm size varies so much so you can use that as a standard way as well our like I said our proteins are coming from a largely I'm not amount of our a large amount of our animal products so like our fish I'm meat poultry and pork our eggs we do want to go for the lean cuts if we can they're going to be lower in saturated fats so remove the skin when you can remove any of that visible fat that you may see I'd only get a more lean cut and you know egg yolks is going to be the majority it's gonna be all of the fat and the eggs but you're looking out there if you want to lean source of protein from your eggs go for the egg whites through the egg substitutes geez it's gonna be another source of protein but again it's gonna be higher in saturated fat so try to go for the reduce or the low fat cheese to give you an idea one ounce of cheese has 5 grams of saturated fat so if you're going for a reduced saturated fat diet that can be you know quite a bit of your saturated fat for the whole day if you're going for just 7 percent of your calories from saturated nuts and beans peas lentils Williams they're all going to be good sources of plant proteins they're also going to be lower in saturated fats than our animal proteins so they're a great way to get some quality protein and without a lot of saturated fat that's not butters tofu soy those are all made from soy beans so a nice team source they're trying to get a lot of proteins from there it's gonna be a great way to increase your fiber in as well so you're getting plenty of fiber from those those plant sources of protein moving down on the food label like I mentioned vitamin D and potassium are now on the food label list and they took off and they also added the gram the milligram or the microgram amounts of these though the actual amounts listed there versus just the percent daily value which is more helpful when we have specific goals that you're actually shooting for calcium and iron are still there and they removed that using chart there on the bottom so this is where we're going to play the what I call the calorie game to see how many calories were actually getting from this food just based on what we see here that the carbohydrates and the proteins if you remember that's where our calories are coming from fat carbs and protein and you should them have their own amount of calories per gram so fat has nine calories per gram carbs and proteins both have four calories per gram so if we take a look at this food we can see the fat grams in this food there's nine calories per gram and in this food we have eight grams of total fat listed so 72 calories from fat moving down to our carbohydrates we've got 37 grams and total carbs in this food our carbohydrates has four calories per gram so 7 times 37 times four we have a hundred and forty eight calories from carbohydrates in this food protein listed here is three grams of protein so four calories per gram of protein four times three we have 12 calories from protein in this food adding that all up together you have the actual calories of being 232 calories in this food versus what they're saying the calorie amount in this food is 230 so they're actually allowed to round these numbers and they do pretty much always it's very rare that you'll actually see 232 or 237 or an odd number listed there so they do often round these numbers so just something to keep in mind there there are a little bit of hidden calories listed in your food that are not listed in your food rather so something to keep in mind if you ate with two extra calories per serving actually 16 calories there that can kind of add up throughout the day if they're rounding on a major scale or if you're eating a large amount of other servings of this many different foods it can really add up little ways so just something to keep in mind there I like to play the calorie game every once in a while just to see how how far off they can go as I mentioned your ingredients list is also included here it's an important part of that that food label and the ingredients like I was saying saying you always want to look for that hole in your food looking for the whole grain the whole wheat you can see in this new label here on the right we have exactly that that whole word and it is in descending order about weight so if whole wheat flour is the first ingredient on this food that's what is contributing they're the most weight to this food water is the second post and then corn syrup is the third mode give you an idea of where your ingredients fall but it doesn't say exactly how much of each is listed in the food you just see the order and like I said you want the first ingredient to be a whole food so typically the first three ingredients in the food label it's gonna give you an overall idea of what the food actually is for this bread that we have here whole wheat flour white water and corn syrup it's probably obviously grab it is breath but you can see it probably is bread because the flour water and syrup and sugar essentially so I'll give you an idea there food we have pasteurized sweet cream and salt probably butter what you this so some people say to look for clean labels but I like to pay attention to the actual Nutrition Facts label because just because there's two ingredients in this food doesn't mean that it's an excellent food to go for it's still higher in saturated fats so just keep that in when you're looking at your food it is helpful to go for the fewer ingredients the better you know compared to this ingredients list there's a lot of things on here that you probably can't even pronounce so going for the fewer ingredients is always going to be better but not always meaning it's a free-for-all this is something else I like to attention to to what the ingredient list there are so many things that they can say in terms of sugar so if we look at this list here we have corn syrup listed and we might have you we have honey there that's another source of sugar there are so many different things names for sugar in our food this is just really for the wow factor of how many different names for sugar there really are our food and this is cutting it off somewhere to you know this isn't literally all of the sources of sugar that you can have but this is to give you an idea of how many different names for sugar can be listed that's why I love that they added that includes however many grams from added sugar on that way you can instead of knowing every single word sugar that there may be you can just look at the added ingredient and added sugar and how many graham added sugar is actually much more explicit I don't know how many of you guys have seen this facts up front here and it's listed on the front of your foods and this is something that you'll often see on on especially cereals I see it on a lot of cereals and it's something that's not federally regulated it's something that the manufacturers came up with on their own and they started rolling it out on their own so it's the industry created version of the nutrition facts panel you can see that there's only a few things listed here four things are listed here versus if you turn the food around you would get a lot more information of what you're actually looking at on the food so I always bring a skeptical eye to this because it is kind of what then your company wants to highlight from their food it's not always going to be the best thing to look at they're probably just highlighting things that that they think people might want to know about their foods so if it's gonna be a low sugar or food they're probably going to mark it up as being they're probably going to put their sugar upfront here even though you might actually be just watching the total carbs that you're eating so looking at the food label instead of being distracted by the fact that front here I always bring after or I do this some other health claims that we may want to keep in mind and we might see on our food labels so you'll probably feel ganic on your food labels so organic is a regulated term it's made that the food is made without most conventional pesticides fertilizers or without fertilizers that have any kind of synthetic ingredients or is made without sewage sludge bio engineering ionized radiation so it's out without any of those those types of fertilizers so it's avoiding conventional pesticides only using these organic pesticides that are actually allowed and those are the only ones that are used so organic actually is a health claim that is regulated and often times these foods are made in more nutrient dense soil so typically these foods are going to have more nutrients to them but that's that's pretty much the only difference here there hasn't been any negative effects really to conventional if that's what you can afford and by all means by the conventional fruits and vegetables you don't have to buy just organic but there are probably a little bit more nutrients in the organic varieties non GMO is another claim that you might see so non GMO is a regulated health claim and all organic food is non GMO non GMO is not inherently organic so they are two different terms they do mean two different things and the non GMO means that they're made with foods from non GMO ingredients and there are only certain things that are allowed to be GMO or genetically modified organisms in industry so it it can be made the foods made without GMO are genetically modified or corn soybeans NOLA alfalfa so they're foods without those ingredients have been genetically modified in some way often times they do genetically modified the foods just so that they be more resistant to drought or certain pests or other types of diseases so they're not genetically modifying it for necessarily negative reasons they're trying to increase the crop in that way and I think the biggest health concern here has been what they're actually doing to the environment versus what actually is going on in the human body when we eat GMO foods there hasn't been any negative health effects that have been linked to people eating GMO foods versus non GMO foods GMO free this is an impossible claim to test you can't grab a section of a food and test if there's GMOs in it that's not a testing so GMO free is an impossible claim if you see that definitely you know put the product down that's probably something a little out there no added hormones this one can be misleading because all poultry must be raised without hormones so if you see this on your poultry and it's marked up a whole bunch keep in mind all poultry has to be raised without hormone so that's something to just bring a skeptical eye to page three so this is you know usually our eggs or our chicken so chicken have to have one square foot of roaming space in cage free foods to be labeled as cage free so one square foot I don't know if you want to think about that hold your hands up and try to see what a 1 square foot of roaming space actually looks like it's not very big so a 1 square foot of worming space for cage free chickens you know it's really if I don't know how much of quality of life that actually is free-range one square foot of roaming space except for they do have access to the outdoors but it's not regulated how much they actually go outside so this can be one small window that they have at the top of the cube and it's not regulated how often they actually go outside this can be open or you know two hours of the day and then they close it again and every range so not really you know a regulated health claim and then pasture-raised so this one's actually more legitimate pasture aids means that the animals actually have access to the past year all year round so they can't actually go as they please grass-fed so they the grass-fed animals in addition that to they can they're fed the grass in addition to being able to roam the pastures as they please so they're fed grass they may be supplemented sometimes with with grain but the primary food intake is is that grass because they can go throughout the pastures and so grass fed animals are typically higher in omega-3 fatty acids because they're eating more grass which is higher in omega-3 fatty acids and the soy or the corn or whatever feed that they might actually be eating so so these foods are going to be higher in omega-3 fatty acids so healthier for us so those are just a few health claims back and I like to go through um you can always let me know if you have more question but you know all in all portions is the name of the game portions portions portions we like to say so people are notoriously awful at estimating how much is serving actually is when they try to serve themselves a cup we're pretty bad at doing that so get out those measuring cups actually not measure your food out if you have a food scale that's a great way to go about it to the weight of the serving is always listed on the food label there so you can actually weigh out your food and it's really important especially if you're first getting started and then check in with yourself every couple of weeks or so to make sure that your portions haven't accidentally gotten away from whatever you're actually shooting for so by all means get out those measuring have certain skills and and try to get some accuracy they're his versions is the name of the game and it can allow you to have more flexibility to you might realize that you're eating less than you initially thought or you might be eating more than your initial and now you can actually be more accurate with and there is there are some tools out there and this is one that I like it just using your hand as a reference because you bring these with you everywhere you go so there are great references to use and this is a little blurry but three to four ounces of protein is typically going to be about the size of your palm but like I said these palm sizes vary for us so maybe bring out on the side so a deck of cards and compare that to your palm size that'll be about three or four our one thumbnail is about a teaspoon so if you're looking for a teaspoon of butter just going for one thumbnail your thumb your holes on this this would be about a serving for some peanut butter or or some cheese one thumb it's gonna be the serving bear your fist is about the size of a cup for everyone's this size berries and these are all up for discretion but you know just as rules of thumb a cup is about a fist so if you're looking for a serving of casserole I mean that Thanksgiving dinner or something one cup button size of your fist it's going to be a serving in that casserole 1/2 of a cup it's going to be about the size of one cupped hand so if you're looking for a half a cup of I don't have potatoes or ice cream or something you can kind of use your hand to visualize how much you could actually fit in there and then to cupped hands is going to be about an ounce so about a serving of chips or crackers or pretzels would be about two cups hands but this is you know just to naturally cup can not necessarily piled high and imbalancing so you know be honest with yourself there we're all pretty good at lying somewhere and others though I just try to be honest there's also the my plate um so my plate I'm going to show you here this is the my plate is just to give you a general idea so in general you can use this as your as your your steps so using a dinner plate you can cut it down the middle and then cut another section into quarters see you resections on your plate you want to fill the largest section with non starchy vegetables so think your your broccoli carrots cauliflower candy and a mixed salad full of you know lettuce and tomatoes peppers onions mushrooms so that would be the largest section this smallest section when you would want to put your starchy foods or your grain so let's rice or potatoes your your winter squashes perhaps or your your pasta now make up a quarter of your plate and then the other quarter of your plate would be your protein so some kind of animal source perhaps like this sure or again or something going for those and then you would want to add a serving of fruit or you could add dairy or both as your meal plan allows so yeah so in lieu of dairy in this food in this plate we had fruit oftentimes we can get the same amount of the same vitamins and minerals that we can come right Dario we can get from our fruit so having that side of fruit or or dairy is a great way to get that in and then we have water here on the sides so staying hydrated as well this library that we're eating and then of course you see this ruler here on the bottom this is for a standard nine inch plate lights have gotten larger over the years so I encourage everyone to try to pay attention to the size of their plates if you put the same amount of food on a larger plate it's gonna look like a lot less food so be honest with yourself about the size of your plate sometimes it can be helpful to get a smaller plate if you're trying to lose weight so you know be be aware of how big your plates actually offer out to eat those plates are typically even larger about 11 inches or so so I'm trying to just keep that in mind when you aren't going out to eat this may be a very large plate so if it could just be this could be a lot of food on a large plate and it doesn't look like much to me or you know just being aware of what you're actually doing their plate sizes can make it big difference in our breeding and then a recap of nutrition but you do want to do read those food labels try to measure your food and beverages so you can be aware of how much you're actually eating we do want to eat carbohydrates but going more for those those more quality carbohydrates over the empty carbohydrates when you can try to eat your protein we're going for the lean protein as that will be less than saturated fat you know those healthy fats those unsaturated fats are going to be more heart-healthy so we want to go for those ones we want to watch our sodium content as we saw the most Americans are eating too much sodium so we do want to try to limit the sodium where we can and I do have a plan no or that way to have some kind of ballpark idea of what your what you're trying to do um try not to eyeball or guess your food especially at first and like I said humans are notoriously bad at being able to estimate volume so do try to measure avoiding those empty carbohydrates if you can I'm going for this more car behalf this more quality carbohydrates where you can and try not to eat too much saturated fat for sodium try to limit those ones and definitely don't get discouraged no one's perfect there's no one perfect eating plan so just trying to do the best with what you can and you know there's only so much you can control so just focusing on what you can actually control there are some helpful apps or websites that people like to use especially when they're first getting started a lot of them have like blogs that go along with it so you can get a good idea of how your what you're actually shooting for things like calorie King lose it there's website calorie King also comes in a print version so you can kind of carry on a pocket size of of the application and a bunch of information in there and all of these are free and making sure you're getting enough water there's so many different daily water tracker you can try to see how much water you might actually be eating in a day we are shooting for about 64 ounces the water at a minimum per day so I'm comparing yourself to that goal it's all I have for you today hopefully you guys enjoyed investigating the food label with me but by all means let us know if you have any questions everyone Stacy", "vseihahgia4": "hey guys it's lily pad welcome back to another episode of Pretty candy creations um as you can see i am back at my couch my blindfold on and my soul with all of my favorite spin spinning so now we're making is chocolate caramel covered pretzels so now i have all my ingredients and tools here to make our caramel chocolate covered pretzels the things you are going to need are some prep mom's thick pretzel sticks i bought two bags i picked out the longest ones I could find that we're broken you are going to need some chocolate this is a little less than a pound of chocolate but it depends on how many pretzel rods you're making it's 50 pretzel rods to a pound of chocolate and you are going to need some caramel I mean this care about myself and if you want to learn my recipe for caramel i will put a link to the recipe in the description below you are going to need a piece of parchment paper and a baking tray so now let's get started with the first step so the first thing we need to do to make our pretzel rods is to soften the caramel in the bike so that we can spoon it over the pretzels easily and we can pack it in and let it set without having two much problems because this terrible is pretty firm and you're terrible should be too so what you're going to need to do is put your caramel into a microwave-safe bowl and then microwave it for 30 seconds that's cert a little bit that microwave it for 20 seconds then stir and keep microwaving at 20-second intervals until your your caramel is soft and beautiful but not completely liquid so now that I have softened my caramel it is time to coat our pretzels in caramel so the way you do this is you scoop the caramel onto the pretzel and cover most of the pretzel but leave a little bit of the end for gripping and then you just place your pretzel on a parchment sheet and do that to the rest of your taxes so once you have fitted all the pretzels that you care onto your sheet line with a baking tray you want to pop these guys for two minutes if the freezer to make to let the caramels set so now that our pretzels have been in the freezer for two minutes you want to take each one and you'll notice there's a flat side to each pretzel so what you want to do is just take the pretzel and with your hands warm it up a little bit and just press out the lines a little bit of the pretzel and try to make it as round as possible and then do that with all of your pennies so here i have my chocolate pieces that we are going to melt and dip our caramel covered pretzels in the chocolate so that they have a double coat which is double delicious so wet when you melt your chocolate and kids you making you can't just bail chocolate and then dip and that's it in candy banking you have to temper the trombone which means melting the chocolate but then getting it at the right temperature so i will show you guys how to do that right now so the first thing you want to do to temper your chocolate is to take this push aside why am I doing this a push aside a quarter of your chocolate pieces so that you can save them for the tempering process so I am just going to estimate and take these many chocolate pieces and just put them aside and then you're going to melt this chocolate in the microwave at 20-second intervals so now that I have melted my chocolate in the microwave it is time to temper it so you are going to need your chocolate chunks and what you are going to do is just drop the chocolate chunks that are unmelted into your melted chocolate visible swirl and then take a candy thermometer inserted in and wait and stir and wait for the temperature to go up to 86 degrees this looks just about right so once your chocolate is at the right temperature you are going to want to take out all the little chunks of chocolate that are i melted cuz they will still be my melted they will just be floating around in there and you just want to take off all the chunks out and then you can dip your pretzels so now that i have taken out all the chunks our chocolate is tempered and it is time to dip our pretzels so how do you dip your pretzels is you are going to take a pretzel and swirl it in the chocolate as much as you can and then spoon over the chocolate with your spoon and make sure it's completely coated and then just place it on a piece of parchment paper so now that i have dipped all of my pretzels in luscious milk chocolate and coated them with caramel it is time to let the chocolate set and it's going to be really hard to wait on these guys you have to hurry up okay hurry up these guys are so slow so now it's time for the taste test and I have my ball here for the taste test because my sister got bored of doing it so why don't you taste this I would leap Azad too i think i'm going to take this one here ok ok i have to give this a 4 and a half and a half is it i think i would like a little more salt on it but but overall it's absolutely delicious because it has a perfect taste of crunch and chewy mmm with the with the chocolate on top so it's absolutely delicious you're my Willa Willa long gone that's what she calls me well done so good oh my gosh if you're not a salts person then maybe the salt is is not a big deal but I like kind of the salty taste what do you think well I love to close it exercises your jaws yes mm-hmm so you can't feel too guilty about you do here yeah well I'm exercise yeah um though I'm sure they're healthier ways to exercise your jaws but yeah won't justify eating these with that ok yeah the crunch is nice with just curious as you said definitely and the result of a pretzel was to give it the salty sweet taste but yeah it's neat overrides the self yeah maybe we need saltier pretzels maybe that's the solution so yeah they're full book there they're delicious they're wonderful and it's going to ruin our lunch thanks you guys so much for watching this video I really hope that you guys enjoyed it here are our finish pencils and just before I at this video I just want to say a few things about making these pretzels one your pretzels are going to break like look at this tiny one the your pretzels are going to break no matter what and it's okay because the weight of the caramel of the pretzel is a lot of weight step because the caramel is debts so your pencils will break but some of them will stay whole like this one these two these two they all stayed home so that was pretty good also you don't want to put too much caramel on your pretzels because then the petals they just will break in the middle like some of them if you see the pretzels leading to one side that means in the middle there's a crack in the pretzel they're definitely still edible it's just that you don't want to put too much weight on the pretzel so yeah I really hope you guys enjoyed this video I think I already said that like three times and uh if you want to see the if you want to see the recipe for my caramel i will put a link to that in the description below and uh if you want to go see my crazy Katie create videos there you can't go to my channel and i also have a sea salt caramels video and i use the same recipe for the caramel in here so you can also check out that video if you want ah if you want to make these so these are really fun and really easy especially if you buy commercial parable and you can add before the chocolate sets you can add like sprinkles or designs whatever you want on the chocolate so they're really fun and they make a great staff because they think just look you can just like pack these in a container and then take them out and you buy them so wherever you go these are good treat and they're easy to make so so yeah please remember to Like comment and subscribe and I will see you guys next Sunday you", "k8c5LPDk_WQ": "today I'm going to be doing a really fast video this is a really fun one and you don't need a lot of equipment to do it so what I'm going to show you today are my dark chocolate salted caramel fins and what you need for this recipe some dark chocolate you can also use any type of chocolate you could use semi-sweet chocolate you could use white chocolate or you can use milk chocolate they all work equally as well I have some sea salt in my container and our last ingredient some little caramels that are prepackaged mine are made by Kraft but you can use any brand that you find available at your local store and if this is the first time that you're visiting welcome to my baked like a pro youtube channel so let's get on with the recipe if you do have children this is a really fun one to do and it also makes this process a little quicker to do as well you're gonna grab your caramels and you're just gonna remove your paper and then I like to put it in the middle of a piece of plastic wrap and then all we're gonna do is we're just gonna roll these out a little bit I'm gonna grab my rolling pin you can do this with your thumb as well and you can do it right directly on your table if you wish you don't have to put it between the plastic but I'm just gonna do it like this and you can roll these out as thinly as you wish you don't have to go paper-thin as thin as you want them that's a nice little size just like that I'll remove it from my plastic there we have it so you can see how thin that is now and then you can take a knife I'm gonna use a pizza cutter and I'm just gonna cut it right down the middle I like to cut them in half because I find that size is perfect for one bite so I've got a few more I'm gonna do maybe six of these for this video so I'm gonna undo all these I'm gonna roll them out and then I will come back so I'm just about to start my last one I thought I would just show you the process one more time the easiest way I take my rolling pin and I just place it right over the little caramel I give it a really good push just to start it off and then just slowly roll it back and forth until you have the size that you want that's good so get all the leaves together and now I'm just gonna cut all these like I did before with my little pizza cutter then I'm just gonna grab my pizza wheel and you can see how easily it is cutting these knees here make I think a perfect bike cuz that there it's quite large on to our next step before I started my video today this chocolate was a hundred percent solid to melt it down I put it on a little baby which is a water bath and I let it go on a simmer just until about half of the chocolate starts to melt and then I remove it from the heat right away and that little bit of heat that's left over it melts the rest of the chocolate and by doing this I can actually keep the chocolate tempered in today's recipe I am using dark chocolate but you can also use white chocolate milk chocolate semi-sweet chocolate anything that you like it will work just as well so I'm just gonna grab my little caramels just get them right into that chocolate flip them over make sure they're all covered you have a nice little top like that bring it down on to my parchment paper and I am using parchment paper today in some countries that is called baking paper grab another one and get it in there make sure it's fully covered a little tap and I want to get all of the chocolate off because it does make a nicer contour if you don't have it pooling around the caramel that's good and then just slide it right off boom perfect get another one and these here are really really funny and the best thing to do is do all of your caramels first you could even cut all of those up roll them out cut them up the day before and then do the chocolate covering the next day just to make sure that you wrap your caramels really well so that you keep them away from the air and we'll get that on there see the more you take off the nice to your little contour now if you wanted your caramels looking really super nice you could take your pizza wheel and actually cut each piece until it was perfectly square or a rectangle and then take all of those extra pieces and you can push them all together and roll them out and continue on like that so I'm gonna do one more little top here perfect and now we're gonna add a little bit of sea salt I'm gonna turn around I do want to zoom in so you can see how nice these look so I've zoomed in I just wanted to show you these a little closer up now I'm gonna be using my salt now and what you want to do is if you've got a little container that has the opening like this just close it down so that you're not allowing too much sea salt out in one shot so test it before and then you just want to just sprinkle a little bit on there you don't want to overdo this step you don't want to have these too salty I think that's good just like that well that's as close as my camera will zoom in but hopefully you can see how nice these are I'll just grab one of the pieces of caramel and just put it in beside this just to show you the difference here but there we have it at this point because my chocolate was tempered I can see that it's already setting up but you do not have to do tempering for this recipe and that's what's really really nice about it and that's one of the reasons that I make these small so if you have them on a plate at a party somebody's gonna pick one up it's one bite and it's gone and they're not gonna have a lot of melting going on in their hands so this is a really good recipe if you don't know how to temper chocolate if you do want to know how to temper chocolate I do have a video on my youtube channel bake like a pro I'll put a link to that in a description box and you can watch me doing that I'll show that whole process in well quite a bit of depth and hopefully I've done it in a way that that's really easy to understand so at this point I'm gonna just finish off these and then I'm gonna come back so I've just finished up the rest you can see them here these ones here completely dry now and these ones here are just starting to dry I just want to zoom in for the last little bit of my video I'm just gonna grab my pizza cutter and I'm gonna cut into one and I'm gonna zoom in for that so I've zoomed in because I do want to show you this this close-up as I can this will just get right in there I just want to show you what these look like inside this is cut if these are chilled they may crack they may not but the caramel is gonna be much stiffer here we have the inside look at that doesn't that look nice I will have closer pictures on my Facebook page facebook.com slash bake like a pro and also pinterest.com slash bake like a pro and I will probably put them on my Twitter page as well but here we have our nice dark chocolate the sea salt on top and then that nice caramel interior really really fun you're gonna make this once and you're gonna make them all the time afterwards because this is so easy to do and really really fun I tried to keep this video a little bit shorter I hope you enjoyed it if you did please give me a thumbs up subscribe if you wish I really do appreciate that that's it and I'll see you next time and of course I'm gonna have to try a little piece here mmm is so good you", "iRco_tT60CU": "White wine is a wine that is fermented without\nskin contact. The colour can be straw-yellow, yellow-green,\nor yellow-gold. It is produced by the alcoholic fermentation\nof the non-coloured pulp of grapes, which may have a skin of any colour. White wine has existed for at least 2500 years. The wide variety of white wines comes from\nthe large number of varieties, methods of winemaking, and ratios of residual sugar. White wine is mainly from \"white\" grapes,\nwhich are green or yellow in colour, such as the Chardonnay, Sauvignon, and Riesling. Some white wine is also made from grapes with\ncoloured skin, provided that the obtained wort is not stained. Pinot noir, for example, is commonly used\nto produce champagne. Among the many types of white wine, dry white\nwine is the most common. More or less aromatic and tangy, it is derived\nfrom the complete fermentation of the wort. Sweet wines, on the other hand, are produced\nby interrupting the fermentation before all the grape sugars are converted into alcohol;\nthis is called Mutage or fortification. The methods of enriching wort with sugar are\nmultiple: on-ripening on the vine, passerillage (straining), or the use of noble rot. Sparkling wines, which are mostly white, are\nwines where the carbon dioxide from the fermentation is kept dissolved in the wine and becomes\ngas when the bottle is opened. White wines are often used as an ap\u00e9ritif\nbefore a meal, with dessert, or as a refreshing drink between meals. White wines are often considered more refreshing,\nand lighter in both style and taste than the majority of their red wine counterparts. In addition, due to their acidity, aroma,\nand ability to soften meat and deglaze cooking juices, white wines are often used in cooking. == History == === \nAntiquity === The first trace of wine that has been found\ndates to 7500 years ago, in present-day Iran but the results of archaeological excavations\nhave not been able to determine from which time wine began to be produced. Epigraphy tells us about the presence of wine\nin the Middle East: it was produced in the \"High Country\" (the mountain borders between\nAnatolia and Armenia) and then imported into Mesopotamia especially from the 3rd millennium\nBC. The tablets of Hattusa describes wine with\nthe term wiyana in the Hittite language, GE\u0160TIN in Sumerian, and kar\u00e2nu in Akkadian. It could be red (SA5 GE\u0160TIN), light (or maybe\nwhite: K\u00d9.BABBAR GE\u0160TIN), good wine (DUG.GA GE\u0160TIN), honeyed (L\u00c0L GE\u0160TIN) new (GIBIL),\nor sour (GE\u0160TIN EMSA).In Ancient Greece wine had already been developed and used since\nHippocrates, a physician born around 460 BC who commonly prescribed it to patients. \"Vinous white wine\" and \"bitter white wine\"\nwere used among his remedies \u2013 a sign of diversity in production at that time. In Roman times the type of viticulture practiced\nby the Greeks was their model for a long time and production included white wine. Rich Roman patricians organized banquets where\nthe cost of the food was a sign of prestige. In the range of expensive products wine played\na predominant role. The richest citizens built sumptuous villas\nin the Bay of Naples where the vine had been cultivated since its introduction by the Greeks. The aminum or ancient grape produced a sweet\nwhite wine produced as mulled wine resembling modern-day Madeira. The conquering of regions more and more to\nthe north encouraged the Romans to cultivate the vine and to produce lighter and less sweet\nwines. It also encouraged them to seek new wild varieties\nadaptable to these distant areas where the Mediterranean varieties showed their limits. For example, vines were planted on the banks\nof the Rhine to provide the Legions with a healthy drink as opposed to water which was\nrarely drinkable. The wine was drunk cool in summer and warm\nin winter a practice which still continues in the 21st century. === Middle Ages === Wine merchants failed to survive the fall\nof the Western Roman Empire and viticulture declined dramatically. The Germanic tribes preferred to drink beer\nand did not see the value of the wine trade. The decline of viticulture was intensified\nwhen Vikings cut the sea lanes in the Atlantic. In the south the Saracens were making Ghazw\nor raids. These campaigns in southern Europe caused\nLanguedoc, Provence, Southern Italy, and the Douro Valley to become depopulated \u2013 the\npeople being taken into slavery or fleeing the threat. Knowledge about the culture of grapevines\nwas conserved by the Catholic Church: wine was necessary for the celebration of Mass\nand the monks planted vines at high latitudes and increased the monastic acreages. Difficult to transport and store, wine long\nremained a product for local consumption. The trade was re-established initially after\nthe enrichment of the nobles and prelates because, as with the Romans, the art of the\ntable reflected the reputation of the host.River trade was of great importance in the development\nof vineyards. The Germanic countries benefited from the\nnavigability of the Rhine and the Danube so they could export their production. Charlemagne contributed to this growth by\nenacting his Capitulare de villis which included a set of rules on the cultivation of the vine\nin all areas. It was an era of great development of the\nculture of white wine in Germany and Austria. The Central European vineyards reached 100,000\nhectares which was three and a half times the area in the 1990s. From the 13th century traders distinguished\nvinum hunicum (wine of the Huns), which was drunk by the people, from vinum francium (Wine\nof the Franks) which was the wine for the wealthy aristocracy. There was recognition of varieties of Riesling\nand Sylvaner from the late Middle Ages. Part of European trade was by sea along the\nAtlantic coast. The English, then the Dutch and Scandinavians\nfrom their demand for wine, created a craze for planting between Bordeaux and La Rochelle. Little dry white wine was produced for export\nfrom La Rochelle while Bordeaux exported mainly wines from the hinterland received via the\nGaronne. When wine production was introduced on the\nbanks of the Charente in the 17th century, Charente white wines were introduced as cognac. At the same time, the dry white wine popular\nwith the Dutch was produced to the north, around the port of Nantes from the current\nareas of Muscadet AOC and Gros-plant AOVDQS in the Loire Valley. Vineyards in the Loire Valley and the South-west\nhad their sales network thanks to the navigability of the Loire and the Garonne. In the Mediterranean Basin the Crusades greatly\nenriched both rival republics of Venice and Genoa. To supply the troops of the rich Frankish\nlords these republics provided them with wine from Greece. The port of Monemvasia, which exported a lot\nof white wine, gave its name to the variety Malvasia. The Crusaders also discovered Muscat wine. Once back home, the rulers and wealthy aristocrats\nlooking to buy the sweet wines they enjoyed in the East. They came from grapes that dominated the vineyards\nof Languedoc-Roussillon and Spain. Trade in these wines was facilitated by their\nhigh alcohol content which ensured preservation during the long journey to Northern Europe. === Modern era === In 1453 the Ottoman Empire took Constantinople\nand the situation of the Venetians and Genovese deteriorated. The wine trade between the eastern Mediterranean\nand northern Europe fell sharply. At the same time, the Spanish had just completed\ntheir Reconquista and replaced the Mediterranean wine with its own, especially for English\nand Dutch consumers. The port of Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda began to\nexport large quantities of white wine which was the ancestor of today's sherry. This wine was called sack and caused a sensation\nin England. Even at the height of animosity between the\ntwo countries (as in the episode of the Spanish Armada in 1588) the trade continued \u2013 sometimes\nprovided by pirates who stole what they could not buy. Between 40 and 60 thousand barrels each of\n500 litres left the Spanish coast annually for England and the Netherlands (this volume\nof some 300,000 hectolitres represented two thirds of today's production). From the 16th century the first European vines\nwere planted in America: in Mexico, then Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile. These were in addition to the native vines\nwhich grew in Mexico but this pre-Columbian production was not for the production of wine\nas the grapes were too acidic. It was used to produce acachul a drink sweetened\nwith fruit and honey.The Little Ice Age spelt the death knell of northern viticulture. The vine disappeared from northern Germany\nand Baden, and the maximum altitude for viticulture descended to 220 metres. Hans-J\u00fcrgen Otto noted that: \"all the vineyards\nsuffered and decreased in area\". In England the vine also disappeared. The less early vineyards preferred to select\nwhite varieties of grapes because, even if unripe, white grapes allowed wine that was\na little sour to still be consumable, while red grapes do not give enough colour and green\ntannins make the wine bitter. The interruption of the fermentation by a\ncold winter led to the discovery of the process of secondary fermentation of champagne. The enrichment of some of the population created\na craze for rare wines. This phenomenon, which was already responsible\nfor the development of sherry in England, was reproduced in Central Europe. The discovery of the benefits of the noble\nrot on white grapes took place around 1650 in Hungary for the development of Tokaji wine. Hugh Johnson declared that: \"the Tokay of\nthree centuries ago was the best sweet wine in the world, it was inherited from a long-standing\nwinemaking tradition\". Developed with a grape whose exceptional maturity\nis due to a trade secret, this wine is also developed its qualities through a process\nwhich long remained a secret in underground cellars of the winery. Prized by the House of Habsburg, Tokay experienced\nprofitable trading. Attempted imitation came to nought and the\nuse of noble rot remained a secret. It was not until 120 years later that a method\nof very late harvest was experimented with on the steep banks of the Rhine. Its use in Sauternes was attested in 1836\nin the Ch\u00e2teau La Tour Blanche but at that time very late harvest gave a very rich wine\nthat required several years to age in barrels.Other regions were discovering secrets which would\nmake them rich. So it was that Dom Perignon was the legendary\ncreator of champagne. In a northern vineyard he developed a special\nwine that would give rise to an exceptional passion for wine produced in a climate where\nit could not be expected for wine to reach maturity nor sufficient colour. The fashion of drinking cheap dry white wine\nstarted in Paris in the 18th century: to evade the excise duty the Parisians took the habit\nof going to drink their wine at the producers premises outside the walls of the city. Cabarets opened their doors by the river,\nbecoming Guinguettes (similar to taverns): so the wine that was drunk there was also\ncalled \"guinguet\". This is a wine from the hills of the Seine\nor the Marne, sour, but the conditions of transport of the time did not allow it to\nbe used prematurely. === Contemporary era === Champagne was created in the 18th century\nbut it was in the next century that its global expansion would occur. The crowned heads of Europe quickly made the\nwine stylish in their courts although its production, necessarily in bottles, made a\nvery expensive product. Hugh Johnson assigns an important diplomatic\nrole to champagne: Talleyrand would have offered this wine at the negotiating table of the\nCongress of Vienna, using it to relax his partners in the discussions. The occupation of Champagne by Russian troops\nin 1815 publicized the sparkling wine to the Russian aristocracy. The Veuve Clicquot (Widow Clicquot) booked\nher wine to her occupants saying \"they drink today, tomorrow they will pay...\"The progress\nof the glass industry (especially from the use of coal) helped to democratize the use\nof the glass bottle. The production of sparkling wine increased\ndramatically and spread to the American continent. The technique of manufacturing was industrialized\nand other regions were inspired but the reputation of champagne suffered. The commercial flight of champagne was a product\nof the industrial revolution that allowed it to be within the financial reach of the\nbooking middle classes. The period of the 19th century before the\narrival of phylloxera was a golden age of wine. The industrial revolution enriched a bourgeoisie\nclientele for the best wines and the rural exodus to the factories created a large market\nfor mass-produced wines. A prominent example for white wines was the\nviticulture in Germany. The feeling of freedom infused into the German\nwinemakers under French occupation during the First Empire prevented the aristocracy\nand the clergy from recovering all the vineyards from which they were dispossessed. The practice of late harvest was widespread\nand the more or less sweet wines gained balance against their always lively acidity. In 1872 the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute\nwas created and it was the source of a great amount of interbreeding giving new varieties\n\u2013 the best known of these is the M\u00fcller-Thurgau. During the same period, Switzerland adopted,\nalong the shores of Lake Geneva, vineyards predominantly producing white wine. During the 20th century planting vines in\ncountries where it was unknown was booming. However, it was shaky in places with higher\ntemperatures during fermentation. The use of larger containers creates problems\nof fermentation: the yeasts produce heat which cannot escape and beyond 35 \u00b0C the micro-organisms\nbegin to suffer and fermentation slows then stops. After cooling the wine a new addition of yeast\nis needed to resume fermentation (not to mention the adverse effects on the wine's aromas and\nthe risk of lactic bite). In California the search for temperature control\nof fermentation matured. Applied to white wine they revolutionized\nthis type of wine. European wines, marked by their processes\nof crushing the grapes are diametrically opposed to those very fruity wines marked by a refreshing\nliveliness. During the years 1960\u20131990, these methods\nof wine-making moved to Europe and the use of refrigeration equipment is now widely used\nin almost all regions producing white wine. == Geographical distribution == === \nProduction === ==== \nClimatic zones ==== Many wine-producing countries produce white\nwine, however the white grape needs less heat than red grapes to ripen: the lack of maturity\nof tannins is not a problem since they are not extracted in pressing. In addition the taste balance is based on\na significant liveliness due to the acidity. The grapes for the production of dry white\nwine are harvested just before ripening. These production conditions can result in\na more northerly or mountainous location for the vineyard producing dry white wines. In Europe, German vineyards are predominantly\nwhite (63.1% of production area in 2006), as are the Swiss vineyards (more than 50%\nof the area in production are white grapes) and the Luxembourg vineyards (93% of the production\narea in white or grey grapes or gray). In France the northern half produces most\nof the white wines (Alsace, Jura, Champagne, and the Loire Valley). In Spain, paradoxically, Castile-La Mancha\naccounts for 50% of the Spanish vineyards, producing mostly white wine on a very large\nproduction area in a high temperature zone. The Catalonia region produces a lot of white\ngrapes which are transformed into Sparkling wine called Cava. The producing area for Cava is 45,000 hectares\nout of a total producing area of 65,600 hectares.The Americas have developed both white and red\nwines, some of which are now recognized worldwide. White wines have to conquer hostile territories\nwhere red wine dominates such as the Rocky Mountains or Canada. In Canada, the technique of ice wine can produce\nexceptional wines in a climate which is apparently unfavourable. Canada is the largest producer of ice wine\nin the world.The warmer southern areas also produce white wine, but in a lower proportion. In addition, it is more often sweet or fortified\nwines, natural sweet wines or \"vin\u00e9s\" wines, as in the case of vineyards around the Mediterranean\n(muscat, madeira, marsala etc.). ==== Geological zones ==== According to Claude and Lydia Bourguignon,\nred wines are well suited to soil based on limestone while the best white wines are produced\non soils over metamorphic rocks (Alsace, Moselle, Anjou) or volcanic rocks (Tokaj in Hungary\nand Slovakia). In addition, white wines are also produced\non land with a limestone sub-soil such as the chalky base of the Champagne wine region\nor the limestone under siliceous marl of Chassagne-Montrachet form the backdrop to some of the most prestigious\nwines in world. === Consumption === == \nGrape varieties == Numerous varieties of grapes can be used to\ndevelop white wine. Some have achieved a strong reputation thanks\nto their marketing of a wine variety: Chardonnay : originating from Burgundy and\nlong sold under that name under the communal AOC or premier and grand crus, it has spread\nto many new producing countries who sell under the name of the grape. It can be made sparkling or still. It typically has a wider-bodied and rich citrus\ntaste compared to other white wines. A common choice of food pairing for this wine\nis fish or poultry. It owes its world distribution to its quality\nin a very wide variety of regions of climate and geology: from France to the United States,\nAustralia, and South Africa Sauvignon : originating from the centre of\nFrance and the Bordeaux vineyards, it then spread to the vineyards of the South-West\nand the Loire Valley. Noticed by Anglo-Saxon consumers, it spread\nto growing regions in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. It is remarkable for its typical vegetable/mineral\naromas so tends to be flat and lack fruit qualities. The dominating flavours range from sour green\nfruit such as of apple, pear and gooseberry through to tropical fruit such as melon, mango\nand blackcurrant. A common food pairing for this wine is seafood,\npoultry, and salad. Riesling : originates from German vineyards\n(Germany, Alsace, Switzerland). It is a grape that can be of high quality\nin a variety of soils provided that yield is limited and climate tends to a continental\nclimate This type is much lighter in comparison to other white wines and typically has a green\napple aroma. Common food dishes that go well with Riesling\nare fish, chicken, and pork. M\u00fcller-Thurgau : the most widely grown grape\nin Germany which gives a fruity and well-balanced wine but that cannot be kept very long\nMuscat : a group of varieties (over 150 according to Pierre Galet) which have specific aromas. Typically made from Italian and Austrian grown\ngrapes, it can offer a sweet and fruity taste. Shows best on its own without a food pairing. Petite Arvine , originated in the Valais in\nSwitzerland. Historical documents reveal it has been grown\nsince the early 17th century, around 1602. Typically medium-dry, this textured wine contains\na generous amount of extract from its thick-skinned berries. Highly regarded by modest vintners, it has\nbecome the most frequently grown wine in the most prominent wine growing region of Switzerland. The variety is often paired with central and\nnorthern European foods. Other grape varieties are less well known\nas they may be marketed under an Appellation or mixed with other varieties: Air\u00e9n : a little-known variety, yet it is\nthe most planted vat wine in the world with 390,000 hectares. It is second only to the sultana. Grown almost exclusively in Spain, it is planted\nin a low density and produces a dry white wine consumed locally\nCatarratto bianco comune : a grape from southern Italy, it gives an aromatic and high alcohol\n(14% of volume) wine. It is one of the varieties of grape used to\nproduce Marsala and Madeira Chenin : a French grape from the Loire Valley,\nit is also grown in South Africa. It yields a very fruity wine, sometimes mineral,\ndry, or sweet depending on the soil. It can be kept for a long time and take on\nthe noble rot Maccabeu : a Spanish grape, it is used to\ndevelop Cava, the Spanish sparkling wine. It is also grown in the vineyards of Languedoc-Roussillon\nin France. Its wine is dry and fruity and yields a Fortified\nwine S\u00e9millon : a grape originally from Bordeaux\nvineyards, it is the main variety used for sweet wines from Bordeaux and Bergerac due\nto its ability to take the noble rot It possesses a fig-like characteristic and is often paired\nwith Sauvignon blanc to mellow its strong berry-like flavours. Trebbiano bianco or Ugni Blanc : an Italian\ngrape variety giving a fairly neutral wine. In France this wine is usually distilled to\nyield cognac or armagnac Viognier : a French grape from the Rh\u00f4ne\nValley, it has been planted in California since the 2000s. It yields a very fruity and complex wine\nGrenache blanc : this is the white form of Grenache black N. A variety of quality, it\nproduces fine full-bodied dry wines, albeit with sometimes deficient acidity. It also provides natural sweet wines of high\nquality. Some varieties with coloured skins are also\nused to produce white wines: Gew\u00fcrztraminer : this grape has a pink skin. Vinified in white, this is a very aromatic\ngrape with typical aromas reminiscent of pink flowers and lychees. It is grown all over the Alps. It is an aromatic mutation of Traminer (in\nGerman gew\u00fcrzt means \"spiced\") Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier : these grapes\nare used for the development of champagne and rose wines\nPinot gris (Pinot grigio) is planted extensively the Venice region of Italy. The colour of these grapes range from a copper\nyellow to light pink. It typically has a crisp fruity flavour which\nallows for a versatile food pairing. Sauvignon gris : used to make ros\u00e9 from Sauvignon\nblanc, it has a superior richness in sugar and heavier aromas. It is particularly well suited to the production\nof sweet wines Grenache Gris : this is the ros\u00e9 form of\nGrenache. It is used in the amber versions of Grenache\nfrom Rivesaltes AOC, a natural sweet wine white with a darker colour from oxidation. == Components of the grape and the must == === The stalk ===\nThe stalk (or rafle) is the herbaceous branch that bears the grapes. It consists of about 80% water, soluble minerals\n(nearly 3% with half of potassium) and polyphenols. The polyphenols are mainly tannins and are\nresponsible for the bitter taste and the sensation of astringency. In the production of a white wine, the stalk\ndoes not contain any useful part: its moisture can cause dilution and the presence of tannins\nis not desirable in the wine. This is why it is quickly isolated from the\nrest of the harvest, either by shaking or by pressing. === The grape berry === The grape berry is made of skin, flesh (or\npulp), and seeds. The seeds are hard and are 2 to 5% by weight\nof the berry. The seeds contain 25-45% water, 34-36% carbohydrates,\n13-20% fat (the grape seed oil), 4-6% tannins, 4-6.5% protein, 2-4% minerals, and 1% fatty\nacids. Their contribution in white wine is zero since\nthey are removed in the pressing, in addition, the pressure is insufficient to extract anything\nfrom the seed. The skin is 6-12% by weight of the grape. It is coated on the surface with Pruinescence,\na waxy coating that gives a matte finish to the colour of the grape and contains the yeast\nresponsible for fermentation. The grape skin also contains volatile compounds\nin its deeper layers. These are responsible for the aroma of the\ngrape and for the molecules that become the aroma of wine during fermentation: they are\nthe \"aroma precursors\". In red grapes the film also contains anthocyanins\nor coloured matter which is from bright to purplish red. To produce white wine from red grapes it is\nnecessary not to macerate the grapes, nor to press too hard on the harvest to avoid\nthe dissolving of the anthocyanins in the grape juice. The skin contains a lot of cellulose, insoluble\npectin and proteins, and organic acids: citric, malic, and tartaric acids. The skin of the Sauvignon blanc B grape has\na pH of about 4.15. It also contains between 2 and 3% tannins.The\nflesh of the grape is the most important part \u2013 it is between 75 and 85% of the weight\nof the grape. It consists of large polygonal cells which\nare very thin-walled. With a low pressure the cells leak their contents:\nthe wort. The flesh of the grape contains mainly water. The organic components are fermentable sugars\n(between 170-230 grams for a dry wine and between 200 and 300 grams per litre or even\nmore for Fortified wines) and organic acids, especially malic acid and tartaric acid. Acids occur in larger amounts in the centre\nof the berry while the sugars are in greater proportion at the periphery. This heterogeneity in the distribution of\nsugars, acids, and inorganic compounds in the berry is used during pressing, especially\nin Champagne pressing. This process separates them as it happens\nand uses them to measure the progress of the \"vintage\", the first and second tailles, and\nfinally the reb\u00eaches of insufficient quality to be made into AOC wine. The flesh is the major element of the wine,\nas it is the part that contains the highest proportion of liquid. The flavours are much less present than in\nthe skin. === The wort ===\nIn the case of white winemaking the wort is simply the grape juice from the pressing of\ngrape berries. ==== The sugars ==== Sugars are carbohydrates derived from photosynthesis. The sucrose is made in the leaves and flows\ninto the plant where it is broken down into glucose and fructose and accumulates in the\nberry where it is a characteristic of the maturation of the grapes. Many different sugars coexist: the most common\nare glucose and fructose which will be consumed by anaerobic yeast to convert it to alcohol\nduring fermentation. They are in substantially equal amounts. To verify the completion of the fermentation\nthey can be quantified by chemical assay (glucose and fructose are \"reducing\" sugars that react\nwith an alkaline copper solution called Fehling's solution), an enzymatic method, or by infrared\nspectroscopy. Other sugars are not fermentable at all. After consumption by the yeast, the ratio\nof non-fermentable sugars (the ones that are not consumed by yeast: arabinose and xylose)\nis between 0.5 and 1.7 grams per litre. Sugars exercise a control over the taste \u2013 they\nbalance the spiciness of the acidity and the burning of the alcohol. ==== The organic acids ==== The organic acids are mainly malic and tartaric\nacids. Tartaric acid is a characteristic of grapes;\nin its leaves its content ranges from 5 to 7 grams per litre. Malic acid is present in green grapes and\nits ratio decreases with maturation to give between 2 and 7 grams per litre at harvest. The range is very wide depending on the variety\nand soil with hot climates giving lower rates as the heat accelerates its degradation. There are many other acids in small quantities:\ncitric acid, ascorbic acid, \u03b1-ketoglutaric, fumaric acid, galacturonic acid, coumaric\nacid, etc. Their variable quantity varies the pH of the\nwort. The must of white wine is generally more acidic\nthan red grape must simply because the grape maturity is less advanced. ==== Vitamins ====\nVitamin C (or ascorbic acid) is present in the grape and the must up to 50 milligrams\nper litre. It is a protection in the wort against the\noxidation phenomenon. In the presence of oxygen it produces hydrogen\nperoxide; by this reaction it deprives the enzymes in the wort of oxygen that is necessary\nto oxidize the wine. Since 1962 the addition of vitamin C in the\nwine has been allowed to a maximum of 15 grams per hectolitre at the time of packaging to\nstabilize the wine. Experiments in the late 2000s tried to determine\na method to add it to fresh harvests or in the wort.Vitamin B1 or thiamine is present\nat a concentration between 0.2 and 0.5 milligrams per litre. This vitamin is necessary for the proper growth\nof yeasts that ensure alcoholic fermentation. In the must of healthy grapes the natural\nquantity is sufficient for the yeast. On the other hand, for a degraded harvest\n(by gray mold), the degradation of this vitamin leads the winemaker to add it to the must\nto ensure a trouble-free fermentation. In the case of a harvest with a very clear\nwort and low temperature the yeast works in a limited way and the addition of thiamine\ncan help avoid a difficult end of fermentation. Legislation limits the amount added to 30\nmilligrams per hectolitre. ==== The mineral elements ====\nThe wort also contains minerals. Sodium, Potassium, and Magnesium are most\ncommon. Potassium and also calcium can form salts\nwith the tartaric acid: Potassium bitartrate and the neutral calcium tartrate at the pH\nof the wine. For these, when their solubility threshold\nis reached, they settle and contribute to de-acidify the wort. In the southern regions where acidity is sometimes\na little lacking this may be a cause of failure of extra acidity. == Winemaking ==\nWhite wine is made from white or black grapes (but always with white flesh, the grapes with\ncoloured flesh are called Teinturier meaning coloured juice). Once harvested, the grapes are pressed and\nonly the juice is extracted which is called wort. The wort is put into tanks for fermentation\nwhere sugar is transformed into alcohol by yeast present on the grapes. === The grape harvest === Grape maturity depends on the requirement\nof the final product. For a sweet white wine, whether fortified\nor natural, sugar is the key criterion. For a dry white wine, technological maturity\nis calculated and the fruit is harvested just before (usually eight days) the maturity of\nthe sugar. At this point the relationship between sugar\nand acid is optimal. Further, low acidity will cause the future\nwine to be unbalanced with excess alcohol and lack of liveliness. In addition, the flavour will be less fresh\nand less vivid. Traditional hand harvesting of whole bunches\nhas been increasingly challenged by the harvesting machine for dry white wines, an economic choice\nbut not always a qualitative one. The fragility of the grape requires either\na rapid transfer to the Winery, or protection from oxidation. When the transport time between vine and winery\nis long, the harvest can be refrigerated and kept away from oxygen using nitrogen or dry\nice.However, for some sweet wines, a successful harvest requires manual work and training\nfor pickers to pick only clusters where the berries have reached optimum ripeness or have\nbeen affected by noble rot (for the S\u00e9lection de Grains Nobles). For sparkling wines hand picking is recommended\nand it is absolutely necessary for white wines from grapes with coloured skin. === Treatments before fermentation === The first step in processing the grapes at\nthe winery is to separate the components of the wort that are needed from the unwanted\nparts. The process followed at this stage will largely\ndetermine the future quality of the wine. For this, the clusters are generally shaken\nthen trampled. The practice of moderate trampling allows\nthe grains to burst, releasing the juice and pulp (it cannot be used for white wine from\nblack grapes as the premature bursting of the berries would cause a coloured must). The practice of shaking or stalking has the\nadvantage of separating the stems from the cluster of grapes and avoids giving the wine\na herbaceous taste at pressing. The skin is not macerated and the transparent\nyellow colour is retained. The winemaker can soak the skins of white\ngrapes and practice maceration if the quality of the grapes is good. Pre-fermentation Maceration is generally performed\nat a controlled temperature to delay the onset of fermentation. This technique improves the extraction of\nvarietal aromas and their precursors which are mainly located in the skin. Acidity decreases as does the ratio of Colloids\n(large pectin type molecules) and aging potential. To be implemented, this process requires a\nperfect de-stalking, moderate crushing and sulphite to protect the wort from oxidation. The duration (typically 5 to 18 hours at 18\n\u00b0C) depends on the variety, the temperature of maceration, the maturity of the grape,\nand the quality of the soil. The trampled and de-stemmed harvest is then\npressed. The type of wine press also affects the potential\nquality of the wine. Since the 1980s, pneumatic presses have improved\nthe work involved by working in airtight conditions and allowing a fine control of the pressure\nto extract the juice without damaging the grapes. The juice or mo\u00fbt de goutte (Must of Drops)\nis the juice that flows naturally from the berries crushed under their own weight prior\nto pressing (on the way to the press). Trampling increases its proportion and makes\nthe material profitable by processing a higher tonnage of grapes in the same time. The mo\u00fbt de presse (Must of the Press) is\nthe juice flowing from the press from the pressure on the grapes. It concentrates the qualities or the defects\nof the grape: it is rich in aromas, colloids, or phenolic compounds. However, it can also be marked by olfactory\ndefects, such as the smell of fungus on spoiled grapes or the vegetable smell of a harvest\nwith insufficient maturity. The blending or not of the mo\u00fbt de goutte\nand the mo\u00fbt de presse musts and release depends on the health of the grapes, the method\nof pressing, and the style of wine intended. Manipulation of the grape before pressing\nincreases the amount of lees and complicates pressing. For the development of a quality wine, their\nuse is excluded or very limited. === The settling === The settling is intended to clarify the wort\nby removing the lees from it. The lees are colloids in suspension, debris\nfrom the skins or pulp, and exogenous debris (soil). Static settling consists of leaving the must\nto let the debris settle: after pressing, the must is left to stand in a tank away from\nair. Suspended particles precipitate to the bottom\nof the tank. This is facilitated by the addition of pectolytic\nenzymes which are long chain carbons composed of pectic compounds. These pectins give a high viscosity to the\njuice, cut the suspended particles into shorter chains, and accelerate precipitation. Refrigeration of the wort is needed: if the\nfermentation starts, the release of bubbles of carbon dioxide would spread suspended particles\nthroughout the wort preventing their deposition. After the wort is clarified it is decanted\nfor fermenting.Dynamic settling is performed with a machine that accelerates the separation\nof the wort from the lees. The centrifuge removes the largest particles\nbut does not achieve a high level of clarity. Settling by flotation is a technique where\nthe introduction of a gas at the bottom of the tank creates bubbles which cause the particles\nto rise to the surface where they are removed by a scraper. Filtration with a rotary vacuum filter is\nrelatively slow but effective. It is often used to recover clear wort in\nthe lees exiting the centrifuge.In addition enzyme treatment can improve the settling\nof the Finings. Bentonite plays a mechanical role of ballast\nto settle the colloids \u2013 it accelerates the sedimentation rate. Gelatin is also used to flocculate the suspended\ntannins extracted by the press. Often associated with a bitter taste, their\nremoval is generally beneficial for white wine. Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone or \"PVPP\" allows\nthe fixing of polyphenols and eliminating them. These molecules are responsible for the browning\nof wine and their removal gives an element of stability in the future drink.In the \"stabilisation\nof lees\" (liquid cold stabilization) the winemaker regularly adds lees in suspension for several\ndays so they do not settle immediately. Then he proceeds to a conventional settling\nas indicated above. This technique allows the enrichment of the\nwort with precursors of \"thiol\" (passion fruit, citrus ...) which are naturally very soluble\nin the wort and are particularly suitable for some varieties such as Sauvignon and Colombard. In the \"maceration of lees\", the lees from\nthe static settling are gathered in a refrigerated tank and agitated for several days. After filtration and fermentation they give\na white wine also rich in thiols. Five stages of making Muscadet === \nThe making of the wine === The wort is then placed in a tank to undergo\nfermentation. These fermentation tanks can be of several\ntypes: oak, cement coated with epoxy, stainless or enamelled steel, or epoxy resin. For large volume tanks the control of temperature,\nwhich typically is around 18 \u00b0C, becomes necessary. The majority of aromatic components (acetates\nof alcohol and ethyl esters of fatty acids) are synthesized by the yeast during fermentation\nof light juice below 18 \u00b0C. However, clarity and low temperatures are factors which slow\nfermentation. Recourse to the addition of selected yeasts\nfor these difficult working conditions becomes crucial. In contrast some producers grow their vines\norganically or biodynamically: the lees are of good quality without synthetic chemicals\nharmful to yeast so they are kept in the wine. Turbidity of the must ensures a good supply\nof yeasts and fermentation in small tanks or in barrels then does not require mastery\nof cold. Fermentation starts spontaneously under the\naction of the natural yeasts from the grapes. The winemaker can choose to use a commercially\navailable active dry yeast. It can help to express the characteristics\nof a variety or a method of manufacture. For a dry white wine fermentation continues\nuntil the sugar runs out. The wine is then usually decanted to eliminate\nthe lees. When fermentation is done in barrels the temperature\noften exceeds 20 \u00b0C or even 25 \u00b0C.After the end of fermentation, the wine may also\nhave malolactic fermentation or FML. This second fermentation carried out by bacteria\ndeacidifies the wine: it transforms the malic acid, which has two carboxyl groups, into\nlactic acid. This operation, which reduces the biting acidity\nof the wine, is not always desirable nor practiced. In southern areas the acidity is carefully\npreserved to give the wine its liveliness for refreshing Aroma of wine. During the fermentation of the grapes varietal\naromas are reduced in favour of an increase in roundness and volume in the mouth of the\nwine during ageing in oak barrels. It gives a better biological stability in\nchampagne wines.For a sweet wine, fermentation is stopped before its end to keep some of\nthe sugar: this is the Mutage (fortification). The fermentation can be stopped by adding\nSulphur Dioxide (SO2) (sterilisation of wine), by sudden cooling (anaesthesia of yeasts),\nby sterile filtration (capturing the yeasts in a very fine mesh filter), or a combination\nof several of these methods. A rule of thumb for determining the point\nof mutage, which allows a good balance of acquired alcohol and residual sugar, is to\nleave as many potential degrees as the degrees acquired over 10% by volume. For sweeter dessert wines fermentation stops\nspontaneously by excess sugar and alcohol: Alcohol is waste from the yeast and it is\npoisonous in large doses. In the case of sweet wines an addition of\nwine alcohol stops the fermentation. FML is not done for sweet wines as the lactic\nbacteria preferentially degrades sugar which would give a lactic bite (sweet and sour wine). In addition, the balance of acidity and sugar\nin the wine supports vivacity. A winemaking technique called \"reducing\" or\n\"technology\" has been developed. Very fashionable in Australia and New Zealand,\nthis technique seeks highly aromatic white wines and is very interesting on aromatic\nvarieties such as Sauvignon B, Colombard B, and Riesling B, although less so for varieties\nsuch as Chardonnay B. It works by limiting Premature oxidation in the must or the wine\nat all stages of development. The use of inert gases such as Carbon Dioxide\n(CO2) isolates the grapes from oxygen from the air and cold partially inhibits the action\nof oxidative enzymes in the must. Tyrosinase, a natural enzyme in the grape,\nand laccase, an enzyme coming from the gray mold are very active in oxidation. Laccase can be eliminated by sorting the grapes. Strong limitation on the amount of polyphenols\nin the wine by reducing the time between harvest and pressing is another technique that aims\nto make a very light wine, protected from yellowing. == Preparation of wine before packaging == After fermentation all wine requires constant\ncare to be fit for consumption. All of these practices before bottling are\nknown as \u00e9levage or Maturing. === Maturing ===\nMaturing can be done in a vat. It takes little time to clarify and to prepare\nthe packaging (bottling or Bag-In-Box) but this may be extended by maturing of lees. This type of maturing consists of regularly\nadding fine lees in suspension in the wine. The dead yeast is used for the fine lees which\ndigests itself (autolysis) giving the wine volume and body to support the fruitiness. This operation is called B\u00e2tonnage or stirring\nand is traditionally done with a stick to agitate the lees at the bottom of the barrel. This technique needs to be well controlled,\nhowever, otherwise the wine may take on a Go\u00fbt de r\u00e9duit (Reduced taste) due to the\nactivity of reductase sulphite from the yeast. This operation can be done in vats, as in\nMuscadet, barrels as in Burgundy and many chardonnays, or bottles as in champagne.Maturing\ncan also be done in barrels. The wine is put in barrels after fermentation\nbut fermentation itself may also occur in the barrel. The barrel has a dual role: it flavours the\nwine giving it a scent of toast, butter, and vanilla but it also helps to mature it by\nproviding a very small regular quantity of oxygen through the wooden walls. This oxygen helps to polymerize the components\nof the wine making it less aggressive and more balanced. === Blending ===\nThe blending consists of mixing different wines in order to obtain the desired final\nblend. This assembly can be of varietals (in the\ncase of Bordeaux wines or wines from the Languedoc-Roussillon), or blending of a vintage with varieties (in\nthe case of champagne). This blending may be purely quantitative:\nvarious vintages can be blended to achieve the desired volume. It can also be qualitative; the taster or\na team of tasters (cellar master, winemaker, owner of the estate, etc.) determine the amount\nof each wine to mix together in the final blend to obtain optimum quality. In winemaking blending is always empirical,\nit cannot be predicted that the combination of two or more vintages will give the expected\nproduct. The only secure values are analytical values\n(alcoholic strength, acidity, pH, etc.). === Clarification === Clarification consists of removing insoluble\nparticles in suspension in the water-alcohol solution that is the wine and stabilization\nis to maintain the solubility of the elements dissolved in the wine throughout the retention\nperiod in the bottle and consumption at the table. To clarify wine, it is necessary to wait for\nparticle deposition at the bottom of the wine container but this can be accelerated by the\nuse of oenological adhesives. These additives bind to the insoluble particles\nand fall to the bottom. Tannic acid (or gallotannic) C76-H52-O46 is\nused for the clarification of white wine, using casein, gelatin, or Isinglass. === Stabilisation ===\nThe majority of wine components are dissolved in the wine: certain components, however,\nmay take an insoluble form during ageing or storage of wine \u2013 this is the case with\ntartaric acid. A salt containing potassium, potassium bitartrate\nis in the form of crystals at the bottom of the bottle. This is a natural phenomenon but many producers\nseek to avoid this as dealers and uninformed consumers take these crystals as a fault. It is caused or accelerated by cold storage:\nlow temperature reduces its solubility. The habit of refreshing white wine makes this\nwine particularly sensitive to this phenomenon. Several solutions are available to stabilize\nthe wine: The first is to cool the wine to a negative\ntemperature near freezing for several weeks. The potassium bitartrate crystals precipitate\nand can be removed by filtration prior to packaging in bottles or bag-in-boxes. This solution is costly in refrigeration energy\nand can negatively affect the organoleptic qualities of the wine. Another solution is to introduce Metatartaric\nacid, a tartaric acid polymer, into the wine. Its mode of action is still unknown but it\nprevents microscopic crystals from growing. However, the effect is not sustainable in\nthe long term (between 6 and 18 months) because it hydrolyzes when warm. A third way is electrodialysis: an electric\ncurrent between two plates attracts the wine ions and eliminates them. However, this solution not only acts on tartaric\nacid but also other compounds especially potassium which is responsible for the formation of\ninsoluble bitartrate and also modifies the organoleptic qualities. However, it does allow a definitive stabilization. Reports of high tartaric stability in white\nwines matured on lees has led to research in this area. A protein from the hydrolyzate of the yeast\n(mannoproteins) allows salts of tartar to keep their solubility. The addition of this compound industrially\npermits a good quality stabilization. This solution is the least expensive for energy\nand refrigeration equipment and does not alter the aromatic perception of wine. Nevertheless, tests conducted by the Cooperative\nInstitute for Wine of Languedoc-Roussillon did not show conclusive effectiveness.Finally\nthe study of the addition of cellulose gum or carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) conducted\nin recent years led to its approval in 2009 (EC Regulation 606/2009). Some producers who sell their own products\ndirectly to the consumer, explain these natural phenomena to the customer who then serve the\nwine gently in order to prevent the crystals forming in the bottom of the bottle. The presence of unstable proteins that can\ncreate a visual problem (protein breakdown) in the wine also requires stabilization. Treatment with bentonite allows the precipitation\nof unstable proteins which can then be removed by filtration and extraction. The proteins can also react with Metatartaric\nacid added to wine to prevent tartaric precipitation: the wine then loses its shine and becomes\nopalescent like whey. Some varieties are naturally high in protein\n(muscat. ..) but levels also vary depending on the\nvintage and maturity levels. Finally some white wines can be victims of\nRosissement (pinking). This phenomenon manifests itself in a light\nros\u00e9 colouration of the wine and takes the appearance of a \"stained\" wine or one that\nis contaminated by the presence of anthocyanins from red wine. Yet this is not so: the phenomenon is due\nto the presence of a normally colourless dissolved polyphenol which turns pink due to oxidation. An infusion of PVPP generally eliminates the\nsubstrate of oxidation. Some varieties are particularly sensitive\nto pinking: Sauvignon B, Viognier, Grenache B... === Use of SO2 ===\nSO2, sulphur dioxide or dioxide of sulphur is used in all winemaking operations from\nharvesting to packaging. It plays a protective role in the wine against\nthe phenomena of oxidation, oxidase enzyme action (enzymes that oxidize the polyphenols\nin wine), and the control of microbial populations in yeasts and bacteria (antiseptic effect).The\nmaximum allowable doses depend on the sugar content of the wine: the residual sugar is\nsusceptible to attack by microorganisms which would cause a restart of fermentation. In France the dose is limited to 150 mg/litre\nfor Vin de Pays (country wines), 185 mg/l for Sparkling wines, 200 mg/l for Fortified\nwines, 200 mg/l for dry white wines, 250 mg/l for white wines with residual sugar greater\nthan 5 g/litre (Moelleux wines), and 300 mg/l for liquoreux sweet wines. === Filtration and conditioning ===\nFor sale to individuals or restaurants the wine is filtered if necessary, then conditioned. The filtration consists of passing the wine\nthrough a filter element for retaining fine particles suspended in the wine. It may be fine earth (Kieselguhr), cardboard\nsheets, membranes, or Cross-flow filtration. Packaging is the operation to put the wine\nin the container in which it will be marketed. Over the ages it was kept in a barrel or cask\nand the client would fill his pitcher or bottle at the wine merchant. The appearance of the glass bottle revolutionized\nthe world of wine. The absence of transfer and thus contact with\nthe oxygen in the air has made a significant improvement to the quality of the product. Other containers have emerged: the brick from\nTetra Pak, the bottle of polyethylene terephthalate or PET, the beverage can, and the Bag-In-Box. Their quality is in their chemical inertness\nin relation to wine and their hermetic character against oxygen. The wine bottle has been given certain shapes\ndedicated to wine. The most emblematic is the bottle of sparkling\nwine: because of the pressure inside it is a fairly thick glass. Many countries have adopted this shape for\nbottles of white wine \u2013 a more streamlined form than red wine bottles. == Wine tasting == === \nColour === The colour of white wine is as varied as the\ntypes of wines. The term most commonly cited is yellow. However, the richness of vocabulary leaves\nfree space for visual analysis between the actual colour and the hue (the range of colour\nis often different at the joint between the wine and the glass). At the end of the 20th century the components\nof the wine which made the colour were still not clearly identified. Over the ages the flavones in the grapes were\nconsidered responsible for the yellow colour but their very low dissolution in wine, due\nto short maceration, led to a search for other molecules. A thesis by Biau in 1995 alluded to the influence\nof polysaccharides, proteins, and some phenolic acids. L\u00e9glise specified that: \"the term gold is\nused if the appearance is very bright and full of reflections, in the definition of\nthe various nuances specific to the metal (...) If, with proper clarity, the wine does\nnot shed light and does not radiate reflection, we will give only the term yellow\". On a colour scale white wine can be almost\ncolourless white. When young it usually takes on a pale greenish\nor pale yellow tint. Its yellow colour darkens with age and maturing\nbecoming gold, then copper, and finally amber. One of the darkest wines in the world is achieved\nwith a white grape: the Pedro Ximenez. The ratio of sugar also affects the colour\nof the wine making the colour more sustained, depending of the nature of the grape varietal:\na Bordeaux Sauvignon blanc or a Muscadet Melon have a greenish tint while Chardonnay or Traminer\ngrown and vinified under comparable conditions will be yellow. === Aromas ===\nThe aromas from white wine cover almost the whole palette of wine aromas. The fruity aromas include citrus fruit such\nas lemon and grapefruit, white fruit such as apple, quince, peach and apricot, and nuts\nsuch as walnut and hazelnut. Exotic fruits are also present: pineapple,\nmango, and lychee. Obviously the aromatic palette includes these\ncooked flavours: apple, jam, candied fruit, etc. White wines may also convey floral aromas\nof acacia, honeysuckle, verbena, violet, etc.. (Scents of honey can also be assimilated). Ageing also brings other flavours to the wine. Barrel ageing creates scents of vanilla, butter,\nbrioche, toast, caramel, etc. The long maturing wines like yellow wine or\nsherry have typical aromas of fresh walnuts, almonds, and hazelnuts.Finally the soil can\nimpart a flavour characteristic of a region. Thus, the mineral aromas of flint (odour of\nflint or of light stone) well expressed in Chardonnay B and sauvignon B, and the scent\nof oil is typical of old Alsatian Rieslings B.Same aromas that may be thought to be confined\nto red wines are found in white wines. This is the case especially in some white\nchampagne wines partly made from black grapes and reminiscent of red fruit (strawberry,\nraspberry, blueberry, gooseberry, etc.). === Taste ===\nWhen placed in the mouth white wine has a balance different from red wine from which\nthe tannic structure is removed. The balance is no longer based only on alcohol\nand acidity: this is the factor that explains the difficulty of making a white wine. For sweet and fortified white wines the presence\nof sugar adds a parameter to balance the alcohol and acidity. Maturing in the barrel gives wine a wooded\ntouch and tannins from the oak give it structure. The strongest wines, as in some grand crus\nof Sauternes (Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem for example) even support ageing in new wood. === Glasses for white wine ===\nEver since glass containers have existed, specialised glasses for each type of wine\nwere created. So many glasses, specific to white wine, exist\nin many wine producing regions. The glass must be perfectly clear and colourless\nto properly appreciate the colour of the wine. However, designers and manufacturers of tableware\nhave created white wine glasses with green or blue feet. These colours flatter the wine \u2013 they give\nan artificial colour in the shade (a reflection barrier which emphasizes the separation between\nthe glass and the wine) \u2013 rejuvenating the perceived impression. Sparkling wines are served in particular glasses\nsuch as the flute and the coupe. The flute is the preferred glass for professional\ntasters: the shape concentrates the aromas to the nose of the taster and its height allows\nappreciation of the fine bubbles that rise to the surface. The coupe is not recommended because of its\ntoo flared shape: it does not preserve the layer of foam and the gas and aromas escape\ntoo fast. According to legend, this type of glass was\ndeveloped based on the shape of the Breast of the Marquise de Pompadour. The coupe dates from a time when the wines\nwere mostly sweeter and less aromatic. Since the 1930s and with the habit to consume\ndrier sparkling wines, the flute has taken the place of the coupe. The coupe is also used in mixtures which have\nan olive in a bubbly cocktail and in the spectacular pyramids of glasses that crown festivities. Besides this range of glasses, the work of\na team of tasters, including Jules Chauvet of the INAO in France, led to the creation\nin 1970 of the INAO glass. This glass has a thin glass wall and curve\ncalculated to be able to taste all wines. This glass is used, among others, during the\napproval tastings \u2013 the gateway for the wines to be entitled to bear the name of an\nappellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e (AOC). This simple but elegant glass can also be\nused to serve wine at the table. == Types == === \nDry white wine === The dry white wine is a wine without sugar\n(the sugar ratio is generally less than 4 grams per litre). It is a wine very difficult to develop because\nthe balance of the wine is based on only two parameters: acidity and alcohol. This is the wine that the consumer refers\nto when he speaks of white wine without giving further details. Before the 1950s, the traditional European\nwine was made in small containers where the temperature did not rise high enough to interfere\nwith the fermentation but this method of vinification gave wine structure and roundness but was\nnot aromatic. In California and Australia the need to cool\nthe grapes and wine during fermentation led winemakers to equip their cellars with adequate\nequipment: refrigeration units, circuits of pipes to carry the liquid refrigerant, and\nvats temperature-regulated by coils in the walls of the vessel or flag (a thin welded\ncoil shaped like a flat plate with a high heat exchange capability). This mode of production happened in Europe\nat the same time as new techniques of treatment of the must (accelerated settling, use of\nselected yeasts, addition of glues and yeast enzymes, the practice of maceration). In wine jargon, all of these practices give\na \"technological wine\". This is very fragrant, crisp on the palate,\nand does not require ageing. The \"old\" type of European white wines were\nwell suited to this type of wine \u2013 it was the Sauvignon B grape varietal that was first\nused in this manner which allowed it to be blended with Semillon B. There has also been a decrease in growing\nareas in the last thirty years. In Burgundy these practices may face the phenomenon\nof premature oxidation. Chardonnay is the archetype of the great wine\nthat can be produced with old-fashioned methods. The photo below compares the colours of two\nChenins B and illustrates the visual difference between a South African \"technologic\" wine\nand a \"classic\" French wine from the Loire Valley. === Sweet and fortified white wine === There is a wide variety of sweet wines, from\nslightly sweet all the way to Fortified wine with the consistency of syrup. The origin of the sugar is from the grape,\nthe fermentation is stopped before it ends, although the practice of chaptalization has\nchanged the practice in certain wine regions. Many techniques exist to concentrate the sugar: \"Passerillage with straining\" or \"late harvest\"\nconsists of leaving the grapes on the vine to concentrate the sun. The sugar no longer builds up once reaching\nmaturity but the water evaporates which lowers the yield but increases the concentration\nof sugar. This is the oldest and most common method. It can be improved by plucking the stems:\nthe winemaker prevents sap reaching the cluster and so it dries faster. The annular incision, long practiced, involves\nremoving a ring of bark on the branch below the clusters, the sweet sap cannot descend\nand is concentrated in the grapes, while the sap continues to feed the upper branch. Another quick method is to cut a portion of\nthe stem, the grape is dried upstream but the downstream section progresses normally. The blending in the vat or the press of two\ntypes of grapes improves the final result \"Passerillage without straining\" is a practice\nof concentrating the grapes before pressing. The grapes are hung in an attic or on trays\nfor the time it takes for some of the water they contain to evaporate. This method is the raw material of straw wine\n\"noble rot\" is a method of concentration depending on climatic conditions. The Botrytis cinerea creates microscopic perforations\nof the grape skin through which water is allowed to evaporate while maintaining the other components. The action of botrytis induces different flavours\nin the grape related to chemical reactions in the berry. The precocity of the varietal-land and low\nvigour of the vine are favourable to the action of noble rot and helps prevent gray rot. This type of grape is used for the production\nof Hungarian Tokaji, Fortified wines of Aquitaine (Sauternes, Barsac, Loupiac, Monbazillac,\netc.), and some selections of noble rot berries in Alsace and Germany: Trockenbeerenauslese\n\"Freezing of grapes\" and cold pressing are used to squeeze the liquid part of the berries. The flakes of frozen water remain in the press\nand only the sweet juice flows. This is the principle of ice wine. Cryoextraction is a recent technique invented\nto reproduce the phenomenon in the regions which are not cold enough: the grapes are\nartificially frozen before being pressed. This method overcomes the climate and harvesting\nwork can continue without waiting for the frosts (risk of loss of the grapes by weather\naccident or attack by hungry sparrows), but shortening the maturation does not give the\nsame flavour. === Sparkling wine === Festive Wines par excellence is the prestigious\nimage conveyed by champagne but sparkling wine can come from very different practices. In contrast to sparkling wines, wines without\nfoam are called \"still wines\". Sparkling wine is mostly white and contains\nfermentation gases (carbon dioxide). The first sparkling wine dates back to the\nvery first winemaking. During alcoholic fermentation of all wines\nyeast produces carbon dioxide so during fermentation all wines are sparkling. For most of them the gas escapes and does\nnot remain dissolved. Methods of production of sparkling wines are\ntherefore intended to maintain the CO2 dissolved in the wine which is responsible for the bubbles:\nthe traditional method which was once called m\u00e9thode champenoise consists of vinifying\nwhite or ros\u00e9 wine as for a still wine. A liqueur de tirage (sugar) is then added\nto the wine and bottled. A second fermentation then occurs in the bottle\nfrom yeast and the sugar from the liqueur de tirage. The wine is then d\u00e9gorg\u00e9 or disgorged and\na liqueur de dosage or mix (liquor more or less sweet depending on the desired final\nproduct: brut, demi-sec, or doux). the rural method or craft method for a wine\nin which the fermentation was stopped by cold (in the past it was the arrival of winter\nblocking fermentation). The remaining sugar finishes fermenting in\nthe bottle producing dissolved gas. This is the method developed by the producers\nof Gaillac AOC and Blanquette de Limoux the transfer method uses the traditional method\nbut after fermentation the bottles are uncorked and the wine is blended in a closed pressure\nvessel. It is filtered before being returned to the\nbottle the Dioise method: after fermentation using\nthe standard rural method, the wine is filtered in a vat similar to the transfer method\nthe closed vat method: the second fermentation takes place in closed vats. The wine is filtered then bottled under pressure\nthe continuous method or Russian method: the wine passes from one closed vat to another. Previously the yeasts were fixed with oak\nchips. After filtration the wine is bottled under\npressure the method by gasification: a liqueur de dosage\nis added to the wine then carbon dioxide is injected into the vat. The wine is bottled under pressure. This is the method of production for flavoured\nsparkling wines.The top ten producers of Sparkling wine in the world\nMade famous by the champagne used to christen large ships at launch, sparkling white wine\nis produced in almost all wine-producing countries and has become a benchmark for providing a\nfestive and commemorative spirit to an event. This unique side is found in the labelling\nof the bottle. Firstly the gas pressure requires a heavier\nbottle, then the plug with its mushroom shape must be retained by a Muselet, and finally\nthe top of the bottle is covered with a metallic foil shell gold or silver coloured. === Fortified wine === A fortified wine is a wine in which there\nhas been an addition of alcohol. This category includes three types of wine\nproducts depending on the fermentation stage where the fortification took place: The mistelles or dessert wines are grape juices\nwhose fermentation has been prevented by fortification with alcohol. Although the absence of fermentation can lead\nto discussion of their qualification as wine, it is nevertheless an alcoholic grape product. The Pineau des Charentes, the floc de Gascogne,\nand the macvin du Jura are three AOC French mistelles. The Vin doux naturel or sweet wines are wines\nwhere fermentation was stopped before completion. The added alcohol retains the grape sugar\nand guarantees its smooth taste. The majority of muscat wines fall into this\ncategory (Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise, Muscat de Rivesaltes, Muscat de Mireval, Moscatell\nCatalan, Moscato d'Asti etc.) as do white port, and Madeira. The vins mut\u00e9s secs or dry fortified wines\nare dry wines (without sugar) whose fermentation was completed. A quantity of alcohol is added to increase\ntheir alcohol content. They age for a long time giving wines with\nthe ability to be kept for a very long time. These wines are the sherries and some dry\nwhite ports. == Culinary aspects == The temperature of service is a criterion\nto put wine in the best condition for drinking. The wine must be chilled but not be served\nwith ice. Between 8 and 9 \u00b0C, the chill will accentuate\nthe liveliness of the bubbles and reduce the sweetness of a sweet or Fortified wine. For an aromatic dry wine service between 10\nand 12 \u00b0C stimulates vivacity and gives freshness to the flavours. Finally, the great white wines are best at\na temperature between 12 and 14 \u00b0C which allows the flavours and the structure to be\nrevealed. === Harmony of white wine and food ===\nThe acidity of dry white wine is reduced by slightly salty or sweet dishes while the wine\naccentuates the salty side of food and tempers heavy fatty foods. Sweet wine goes well with sweet and savoury\ndishes to mitigate the heavy sugar and stimulate the fruitiness.For an aperitif, flavoured\ndry wine or sparkling wine goes with all meals. Specialists in tasting consider that the sugar\nor alcohol in some wines has a saturating effect on the taste buds, by contrast the\nfruity liveliness awakens them to the meal to come. At mealtimes very dry wines with little minerals\nare recommended with oysters and seafood: their acidity reveals the salinity of the\nshellfish. The most fragrant wines go well with shellfish,\nfish, or poached white meat. For stews the acidity of white wine counterbalances\nthe weight of fat. If the sauce is well balanced with an intense\ningredient (lemon juice or mustard) a more opulent wine can be recommended: sweet or\ndry wine aged in barrels. Sweet wines either just sweet or fortified\nare a good option for exotic dishes with sweet spices (dishes with cinnamon, vanilla etc.). Fortified white wines are recommended with\nfoie gras. Sparkling wines can be taken at any time during\nthe meal, their diversity allows this. A choice of sparkling wine also allows the\nretention of the same wine from the beginning to the end of the meal. Gourmets generally prefer white wine to red\nto accompany cheese as its acidity agrees well with the fat in dairy products. Dry wines with mineral aromas such as chardonnay\nor sauvignon blanc bring out the milky taste of goat cheese. Aromatic wines, such as Gewurztraminer and\nsome sparkling wines support the strong taste of Washed-rind cheeses (Maroilles, Epoisses,\nMunster, etc.). Neutral white wines (Castilla-La Mancha, Italian\nTrebbiano) are well suited to sheep cheese and there are also Manchego and pecorino romano\nfor a little spicy. The cooked pressed cheeses require a bold\nwine, woodland. There is perfect agreement between the Comt\u00e9\ncheese and the yellow wine of the Jura. Fortified wines are recommended with veined\ncheeses (Blue or Roquefort). In this case, the cheese mould (Penicillium\nroqueforti) and the wine (noble rot) form a harmonious whole. White wine is also a dessert wine. All choices are allowed even if the sweet\nand fortified wines are more suitable for this. Perfumed wines (Gewurztraminer, Muscat), sparkling,\nand sweet wines accord well with fruit desserts (salad, tart). The fortified and sparkling wines support\nrich desserts made with cream or butter. Cr\u00e8mes br\u00fbl\u00e9es or caramel which combine\nsugar and cream can be eaten with a sweet and lively wine such as Juran\u00e7on or a late\nharvest wine. Chocolate requires a very powerful wine so\nwhite wine selection is quite limited: a natural amber sweet wine is the best compromise. More than other wines, white wine is a wine\nthat can be consumed between meals. The habits of the Anglo-Saxons and Germans\nrequire a sweet wine or a dry and fruity wine. === White wine as an ingredient of food ===\nWhite wine is regularly used as an ingredient. Its acidity balances well with fat taking\naway excess heaviness. This acidity also refines the meat or fish\nand it helps to break down the fibres of the meat to make it tender. The role of white wine is similar to that\nof lemon juice used under the same conditions: once verjuice also fulfilled this function. The vinegar combines acidity with a burning\nsensation that gives recipes where it is used a bittersweet side characteristic. As a means to balance the fat white wine is\ninvolved in the preparation of sauces such as ravigote sauce, b\u00e9arnaise sauce, marinara\nsauce, etc. The drippings of cooking juices is also a\nrole that white wine can be used in; made with a sweet white wine and giving a sour-sweet\nor sweet-salt sauce. In cheese fondue the liveliness of dry white\nwine is balanced with the fat of the cheese. The freshness of the wine as a table drink\ncontrasts the heat of the fondue. In marinades its power to soften the protein\nfibre is used. Sometimes it can even happen in cooking such\nas in Italian-style tuna carpaccio.White wine is also used as a wetting agent for slow cooking. In this type of dish it combines the flexibility\nof the meat and balances the fat from the sauce. It plays this role in the case of cabbage,\nbaeckeoffe or risotto, and in the gravy in the preparation of white meat as in osso buco\nor blanquette de veau (veal stew), Chicken with morels and its variants, Chicken \u00e0 la\ncomtoise and Yellow coq au vin, rabbit or with charcuterie such as diots and tripe. It can also be used to prepare fish and seafood\ndishes such as p\u00f4chouse with Burgundy wine, monkfish stew, Flounder stew, mussels in white\nwine, or a Seafood Pot-au-feu.A common rule by gourmets is to serve at table the same\nwine that has been used in cooking. === Nutrition facts ===\nSource: US government == In art == === Painted or drawn white wine ===\nSince the Middle Ages white wine has inspired many painters to include it in still lifes\nor for the representation of the everyday life, party life, or life to excess. An abundance of English, Dutch and German\npaintings from the 17th century depicted a high consumption of white wine at that time\nreplacing the consumption of beer in the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie. White wine has also inspired designers, cartoonists,\nadvertising etc. Ad\u00e8le Blanc-Sec, heroine of comics winked\nat the beverage. She also has cinematic posterity with The\nExtraordinary Adventures of Ad\u00e8le Blanc-Sec. === In literature ===\nA number of authors, poets, and philosophers have celebrated wine in general but the quotes\nare become much more rare when it comes to include colour. Authors in all eras have spoken using white\nwine to illustrate their point. Serious or tinged with humour white wine is\npresent in all kinds of works, novels, poetry, and philosophy itself. The white wine most commonly cited in literature\nis French champagne. Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, an angevin bon vivant,\nrepeatedly celebrated the white wine of Anjou that he liked and it was appreciated by his\nliterary heroes. \"Jumping, dancing, touring \u2013 and drinking\nwhite wine and rose \u2013 and do nothing every day \u2013 What counts as crowns of the sun\"\n- Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais During the Enlightenment, Voltaire and Casanova\ncelebrated wine parties, drunk at fine tables. \"Every guest had at his right a bottle that\ncould be white wine or mead. I know I drank ... of the excellent white\nburgundy\" - Casanova\"From this fresh wine the sparkling foam\nFor our French it is a brilliant image\" - Voltaire White wine is also used in humour, in a drama\nwith Marcel Pagnol or in a gossip radio show for Pierre Desproges. \"Serve me a bottle of white wine if it is\nfresh. - If it is fresh? Touch me there! Looks like it comes from the vineyards of\nthe North Pole!\" - Marcel Pagnol\n\"In June at the fish market, one does not loiter anymore: one strolls. Behind the port, the cherry tomato is nowhere\nto be seen at the farmers market stall. One munches them with salt on the sand with\na basil branch and a glass of Brem iced white wine\" - Pierre DesprogesMichel Onfray has\nwritten a book based on the Sauternes. Partly on wine and its land, its philosophical\nreflection outweighs the viticultural theme. === In song === White wine celebrated by poets was sometimes\nset to music. The most famous white wine in relation to\na song is probably: Ah! the white wine by Jean Dr\u00e9jac and Charles Borel-Clerc. A touch of champagne is a song by Harry Fragson\nwritten about 1890.I am Drunk, sung by Louis Byrec and written by Yvette Guilbert in 1895\ngave the best part to knowledge of sparkling wines:\n\"I come to the wedding of my sister Annette And, when the champagne is flowing,\nI could not hold you, I am tipsy, and I pinched my little tuft. I feel flageoler I feel my legsM\nI have the heart guil'ret, the pleasing air I am ready to cavort\nWhen I drank Moet et Chandon\". Even some varieties are mentioned in song\nsuch as the song entitled Sauvignon by Hubert Lapaire in 1926:\"I dounn'rais the burgundy\nvou the Burgundian And all your sacred champagne wines\nfor a little keg of sauvignon Who gilds the cotiau of nout campaign\nIt is v'louteux it is blondin It is of the little wine franch'ment kind\n... If bin before St. Martin J'mettrons the throat\nunder the champ'lure\" Closer to home Boris Vian celebrated \"Muscadet\nin green glasses, a fresh wine, What cheers\" in his song Mechanical Music. Jacques Higelin wrote the song Champagne on\nhis album Champagne for everyone: \"Seek me without delay the friend who treats\nand cures the madness with me and has never betrayed me. Champagne!!\" === Proverbs ===\nThe consumption of white wine is also mentioned in proverbs: \"White then red, nothing moves, red then white,\nall bugger off\" It means that drinking white wine after a few glasses of good red wine\ninevitably some physical discomfort of\"In the morning, drink the white wine. Red in the evening for blood\" is a bourguignon\nproverb. == Health Effects ==\nBecause of its shorter maceration, white wine contains very little tannin and therefore\nlittle antioxidants that make red wine so interesting medically speaking. However, a team of researchers from Montpellier\nhas developed a white wine enriched with polyphenols. This wine niche is now intended for export\nto Northern Europe, a region that consumes a high proportion of white wine. The sulphur dioxide additive commonly used\nin wine is not harmful in the amounts used but its effects are feared among asthmatics:\nit can cause the onset of a crisis (Difficulty breathing). For others there is no real allergic reaction. Symptoms such as difficulty breathing, migraine,\nor stomach heat sensation may indicate an intolerance. A reaction caused by a deficiency of sulphite\noxidase (the enzyme that breaks down Sulphur Dioxide) is very rare. Studies are underway to investigate whether\nsome of the symptoms attributed to Sulphur Dioxide could not come from another molecule\npresent in the wine.White wine is an acidic beverage with a pH ranging from 2.8 to 3.6. This acidity is an aggressive element to tooth\nenamel.In addition it contains alcohol which is expressed in degrees or percentage. This alcohol can be responsible for cirrhosis. This disease can occur from a regular consumption\nof 20 grams per day for women and 40 grams per day for men. However, studies in California have shown\nthe beneficial effect of wine at a low daily dose for non-alcoholic cirrhosis and this\neffect was not seen with other alcoholic beverages such as beer or liquor, studies will be conducted\nin the 2010s to determine which components of the wine are responsible for this effect. Although many wine drinkers are unsure of\nits health risks/benefits, consuming white wine does provide health benefits. In recent studies white wine was found to\npresent more significant cardiovascular benefits than red wine. As well, white wine contains antioxidants,\nalthough red wine contains higher levels of antioxidants. Both white and red wines are effective in\npreventing LDL oxidation. == Price ==\nHaving been lost in a shipwreck; a case of 1907 Heidsieck was discovered in 1997 . At\nauction each bottle made $275,000 making them the most expensive bottles of white wine ever\nsold. == See also ==\nClassification of wine Classification of Champagne vineyards\nGlossary of wine

me and Lester is trying to come on with this but he's having some technical issues if he gets on great if not it's just gonna be me and Roger today so how's everybody in the room doing tonight I know I'm feeling pretty damn good Roger you just as normal up and down but quiet okay just or svl doesn't know it does nothing it's the same thing yes tapping everybody that I said hello and that Chad already Bob's here Robert and babe Taurus John Wilson Dusty's here I haven't seen dusty in a while and we got the $25 gift card giveaway starting up this is week 13 aka week one okay again we'll run it for the next quarter of the year and then we'll do the 250 dollar giveaway from mark to sponsors real flavors so let me give them a little shout-out here and give us a little real flavors drop that'll be that $250 at the end of the corridor is only available to the past twelve winners of the quarter and then those twelve people will get a chance at the 250 dollar quarterly price but every week we're gonna be giving away this $25.00 from real flavors which is barely coming up here because it's yeah it shows good on Roger he's a little bit darker but yep that's our sponsor it wasn't for Walt he helps us a lot here with a couple of the costs plus what he does for the group I really appreciate everything that real flavors does force and it keeps the lights on here a little bit some I David's here told David so the big winner he was the one that won the 250 smackeroonies last week he's here to start all over again all right Roger you can tell the people what we're gonna be talking about tonight I think they'll started with a core the differences between mixing by volume mixing by weight and mixing by drops and if you're gonna do drops we're gonna explain you the proper way to do it which I highly don't even like dewdrops period but we'll explain that to you and we are also gonna explain the bad things that you can possibly get in flavors I know everybody knows about some of the Lawrence flavors some of them are not vey pible well there's a heck of a lot more than that out there plus there's ones that we do use that are questionable and we'll be discussing them tonight so Bob Roger which one do you want to start on volume wait or drops those mother or I'll do everyone all right here comes Lester Lester let's see if you get a better connection this time yeah well you got a video say hello yeah better better and we are live here too Lester we are live already so good hello everybody so we just explained oh we're gonna be talking about well well you can just follow along with this right now we're gonna talk about mixing by volume because that's what most beginners start off with so who wants to start off Roger or less we can talk about beginners mixing by volume but it's all about so it's nice to sit and complain afterwards you know I'm just gonna sit back I'm just gonna have C tonight you guys do all that with all the talking all right voloom is it's the main thing people used used to mix when a starch it ain't better that it ain't worth sure either than any of the other ways it's the same thing they volume or or weight it's the same thing whatever what's needed you need some syringes it depends on on how much you like or big batches you're gonna make but if you have a 1 mil to an off mil 5 mil perhaps a 10 mil then you should have enough myself I use I use when I'm making it by woolum I use a lot glass rings because then it's easier to clean and I don't get any problem with the components s these things in in ya see-through so everything is very fast I tried glass syringes I kept breaking them all the time let's say something here let's see if he's still breaking up a little bit I'm still here I don't know if I've turned everything else off on the network so yeah can you turn your mic gain down just the hair just a tiny bit because they were saying in the room that you were cracked when coming up with distorted a little bit oh no there talk about the PA equipment sitting behind me oh okay all right yeah so you you are you're making extra sound interact in the black [Laughter] Roger what do you imagine I'm pretty sure you were mixed by weight now but when you first started off or now Roger Lister did you use syringes when you first started out yes I did I have we switched over to to using a scale and weight so but yeah I still use occasionally because I got some bottles that don't have the little drip tip on them you know yeah yeah I'd do the same either head or pipettes but like Roger was saying about the glass syringes I had something I kept on breaking on that so it's it's expensive when you're a klutz you know run down to Tractor Supply and I pick them up I think they're like 35 cents apiece or something like that so yeah that's for the plastic yeah yeah I get AG the 1 mil so I get 3 from my my drugstore things they hand them out to me yeah well I tried dad but they they kind of looked at me funny over here so just cool I go spin at 35 cents and be done with it you know yeah no I don't blame you yeah I bought him attractors to play myself fact I have a whole ton of three miles from here someplace but I see some somebody says normally it's not so possible to get it as corrects with woolum look here it's a syringe is made for 0.1 mils I think they're talking about the meniscus Anacin it's not it's no problem to make it correct enough if you want to buy do it in in pharmacies of why can't we do it in hallways too so but when you got into the bigger bigger you know and you pull out a syringe like like this who know your dad that meniscus that comes in here and everything if anybody doesn't know what the meniscus is when you put liquid in any well it counts it's like a convex cone that comes up here and they've said there's a meniscus and a lot of people measure by the top of that meniscus which is actually the wrong way to measure you gotta mention down on the bottom because what's up top is very my noon but it's still toast people off or X so I think the biggest syringe I gots a 30 mil yeah well and when we're talking about volume I mean volume is not just limited to syringes graduate and I have them I have them all always found at ten mil oh you got a ten mil graduated cylinder and I have a five hundred mil graduated cylinder too but right on up but that's mixing by volume and it is easier when you're going into big quantities and is the nice thing about big quantities mixing by volume is you have a lot more room for error when you yeah you think you're when you take two percent of ten mil compared to two percent of 500 mil that difference is minimal you know if you mess up you know what I mean yep so I agree with that a hundred percent yeah yeah and then that's the way a lot of the bigger companies still mix - you don't they just go by volume and and throw it in and that tiny little percent doesn't throw it off that much yeah well you got a bigger they're probably mixing this stuff up like about 50 per gallon drums worth you know I mean they have measured you know when they get really big and you can afford it they have huge measuring tools but for you know middle - mediocre guys that's basically what they're doing is they're mixing graduated cylinders or beakers or whatever you know so uh yeah but like graduate has on like the smallest sigh had ever had was one milliliter and what was that the master yes that syringe was 0.103 yes for each it's micro yeah it that's it yeah suck my layer is up and that must be like kinda suck VG in a syringe in a bigger but I used it sometimes just to check it but normally you don't need you don't need it that's this it's enough if you have this one meal order to make it you see if it's small amounts yeah I'm not following a chat here to see if I missed anything here somebody was something for a poster to use for a background oh yeah that that's gonna be tough that's gonna be very tough to do well unless you run into somebody dough into a lot of Shoals or something sometimes go on no you could probably go get one made yeah yeah that's possible of course yeah about 15 bucks to make one but you know I don't know how big are you big you want it there's any way you know okay that's the other posters I've yeah I Drive boxes he loved to have a 0.1 syringe - yeah that's uh that's nifty to have especially for some of these stronger flavors it's crazy you can you can buy it from some medical companies who have it I guess even seeing it in eBay I believe I'm not sure but I believe some lead pipe - how you don't - I know anybody else I miss your dating Frank's here crazy Chrissy's here a bunch of people in here today oh yeah yeah I'd like to get my hands I wanted a myself er that would come in handy for a lot of things so really would but it's kind of you can't be cheap yeah I like it when I need to make small tests miss Nixon and I and I want to make it funny it's nice to use it yeah it's perfect for me because I make a lot of five mil testers you know so yeah hmm done it's good very good audience I saw you when you testers that when you're making test mixes me 15 15 I used to kind of like you I used to have my own old line here at a local shop and then shop shut down so I had a bunch of the 15 mil bottles leftover so yeah that's what I use yeah PA ship mics line down their damn test just that's another story though that's but yeah that's a as far as volume goes I highly recommend it for a beginner to start off with for the simple reason that it's cheap and for the beginners you know and I'm watching these chats and everybody no no no buy a scale go buy wait go through this yeah I'm at scale gay myself but those people's just starting out they don't know if they're gonna stick with it and why waste the money you know what I mean there's make sure we don't get us a cheap little scale for 10 15 bucks now and it'll work just fine for the most part long as you don't get you know no big giant 500 mil bottle or something on it yeah but what mike theory is you know those people can only mix for two weeks and get discussed sit with it and it's 15 dollars down the tubes compared to 35 cents that's why I say it I like it yeah I'm a mix biochemist but also a lot of the cheapest rate just shut off automatically approximately two fasts then they get another problem for people so I see whatever people who ask me I say use ruler must start when you when you begin to understand how to mix and everything yes for sure weight is pay is easier span hope it function a lot less clean up - oh yeah definitely my but yeah but but I must say if I do if I do something like this a couple of times that's right that means in alcohol will be the glass syringe then it's ready it's nothing I did the same thing I remember many years ago when a baby when some friends began this discussion about computer it was oh you need to buy the newest one the fastest one everything why I did say I don't sit and play yeah I'm not doing playing on my computer I did do some designs and search things at that time then I found out I need time to drink some coffee too he and the same thing no I need time to wait a bit yeah that doesn't matter if I need to do some extra but but probably a lot of mixers also especially new beginners try to complicate it too much it ain't so complicated as some somebody believes it's say you don't need to shake for a half an hour and everything it's not neither so thank you do it easy and do do the way you fund it if it your you best that's the main thing above all the mixing so and don't try to be make the most superb mix in the world but everybody is gonna run the world around for because that you won't do whatever you need to try to make some mixes you gonna like and if you do it by volume you do it by weight doesn't matter as long as it's good for you true whatever you you know you're comfortable with you know exact I mean I mixed by a volume for a long time before I got into the weight thing oh me too high I must have been a couple years two or three years before I get in mixing by the way you know the the biggest problem perhaps use my weight is that are you gonna use this one gram is one mil or you gonna use the specific weight because develops a big argument a hand with their ass recipe site and my problem with that is I agree specific weights is much more accurate alright but yeah but if everybody does the same thing like a lie card my DIY recipes is setup that everybody does one one milligram per milliliter right if everybody's the same everything's the same correct ILR you people mix in vice specific weight you got people mixing by one milligram per milliliter all those recipes are jumbled together and nobody knows what's gonna that it so if you do everything the exact same like we have our recipe site set up to do yes everything will be great at least an approach and the problem is if you are beginning to use these specific weights then they also need to find out how we gonna calculate it to be a percentage when you put out to receive money don't do that either then we got even more problem the best way if you use one Grammys is terminals none you know it's it's the same thing whatever consistency is the key no matter what no matter what you doing in anything consistency is the key that's what gets all these juice businesses go and they they can make the juice it's consistent all the time no big changes and everything is good yeah listen you should know that that's fine was my rule of thumb everything had to be the same you know oh yeah I have no arguments with you on that at all just look how piece to be gonna be if some flavor in history is rebirth now in its day time focus anything for know who bob says no let pipes as I got tired of clean I did too I'm not scale guy and we're gonna talk about that next I think we got volume fairly well covered let's talk about mixing by weight well we just started talking about specific gravities but mixing by weight everybody knows this fancy littles to dad right here come on who give me the name of a fire one there you go that's the most popular scale let me show you what I got hang on all right he's probably got some one of those tippy scales there you go stay easy one keep hold you know you want cheap here you go yeah yeah I got one floating around here so it's right here in front of me I think it was like like I said about 10 bucks I got you beat this thing was probably about four right here it works you know it works I use that in a while sitting right here on my desk I yeah but that's the most accurate way to measure is by weight it's also the easiest to clean up I did a video comparing mixing by a volume to mixing by weight and I did it extremely fair it is only slightly faster than mixing by weight or by met by volume but yeah like everybody says you don't have to clean up you know yep the only cleanup you have is if you don't have the smaller bottles you're using you know the pipettes and if you're cheap you're rinsing them out but if not you're throwing them away so the rest I just you know the smaller 10 mil bottles they drip right out of the bottle so there's nothing to clean up there and the only the only problem I have with going by weight is not all your bottles have the same tips on them no I'll trip the same well we're gonna we're gonna get into that next we're gonna talk about drops but you're right but for the most part you can try and do we you know that only really hurts it's like when you're trying to put in like you know point zero one word the flavorings and something you're only making 15 or mil you know and then it's you having a hard time when I get that bad I go to a syringe I go to you know what the real small needle on it and it up drip from the syringe I've even gone as far as using a toothpick you know I just drip with the toothpick I don't need I don't need some time to when we were talking about this drip tips oh I didn't find this old one more okay even by my flavor art they had had a blue top and our on top the older one with big blue topped I don't know the size than the orange one benda got two different sizes it's like we're putting out a picture in files in the university there you see a lot of different things and this is another size you have there's so many different sizes it's crazy it's different ones all the flavoring companies need to get the other and put together a standard I think that's something that would help all of us as mixers I don't hear every gonna see that Deanna's yeah yeah but I don't think that's going to happen though for sure but it would make things a whole lot easier for people yes it would but if you're looking in the pharmacy then the laboratory that is normal with the 25 drops Peru mils over what I remembered but yeah somebody's have it some don't have it it's from 20 to 60 drops per minute so in that you can also take him and consider you know the volume of the fluid itself you know the viscosity of the fluid that makes a big difference in the drops crew and you're gonna you know and there is this somebody you know somebody told me one time oh you're flavoring Solway just about the same they're only a little bit off oh no no there I've seen them at point nine grams to 1.6 grams are you know from in TFA you have from point A eight 147 right to one point one 56 in their head there's heavier than that too because I seen a miss a point oh six okay you know you gotta figure okay they're they're using stuff like alcohol as a part of the she got PG as a base you got try acid and in each one of those is going to have a different weight to it exactly I'm doing for ya so it is so it's not possible to make it yeah good enough with drops I see and I'm not gonna mention any names but I know one person is specifically who's a big mixer - oh by the way only does drops but they only know from the same company the same type of bottles they won't very 8 from those flavors at all and but it's still not accurate you know like I said because it'll wait specific gravities of the fluids themselves and in the viscosity fluids it's still that accurate but at least it's more accurate than oh definitely you know I I I also use some of my my flavorings I got I changed my tip yeah to use one type so then I know it a bit easier yeah that's what I'm trying to do is switch everything of same type bottle with the same type tips just make yourself yeah yeah it does make it easier people time to know approximately how much one drop is anyway yeah yeah I just lost track what I was gonna say here so I am got sidetracked yes yeah I'm easy I'm easy to do that now I was gonna say something about that about the dry oh yeah well me even some of the recipes I put out I'll put out like a doughnut recipe or a pie recipe and then I'll say add one drop per five mil of AP to your mix the only reason why I even do that is because it's minimal that one drop AP and even if it is over or lower it's not gonna make that much of a difference to the mix so I don't measure that out you know what I mean us and it's easier for people let them remember in the input size at a drop all right you get a little bit more you might have a little bit more of a bratty note than the next time it's but it's minimal you know I understand it in some mixes but in other mixes you can't do it it's I have mixes when I use toothpicks that just the front of it right and that makes a difference so it depends a lot about what everything is sound I using a toothpick for a pee now are you not at all yeah yeah I don't use IP oh you don't use it at all see now the truth comes out zo is serious Lester he just doesn't like to admit using anything that I use that's what it is Oh honest I've got I don't know how many flavorings over there on my shelves but I probably won't use half of them oh I mean I was buying when I first got into it I was just buying you know every week I go by 10 or 15 20 different flavors you know and it just okay well I'll get to them eventually and they just stack up and sit there and then there's some that I have tried and just I don't like and I'll never use true yeah all that type of flavorings goes down the Dom pair I don't keep the favor I don't want to have I don't see a reason for it I keep in case somebody comes over to the house and says hey can you mix me up something that tastes like you know and I may have that there type of flavor and on the Shelf that I won't use for myself but if they want it you know why not I'll mix them up something I can give them the flavors but I don't want to make something with them if I don't like them so it's be well around here though there isn't very many people that mix but I do have people that do come over the bait that still get juice from me from Tom they're picking that around here in the room and and Dusty's picking at me I'm getting all yes come on [ __ ] I'm gonna knock you all down with a Salman when toothpick I agree you no problem this I agree with them on toothpick your salmon is definitely no it's not enough yours you're just a bunch of guys in a box everyone wait when it comes to fish beeps that you don't you don't understand oh I see people suddenly begin to like with with their with the flour flavorings inside why flavors taste [ __ ] everyone believed or something I don't know but if nobody have gone further than they've been stuck with the first or I for yeah - yeah I don't want to be standing with this ri4 I don't like our rifle so just sit there with your ri4 and let me wipe myself I remind everybody here again in a couple minutes I'm gonna put up the fancy key word that everybody is gonna have to type in the chat for our $25 gift card from real flavours we're gonna do that in a couple minutes after we get them picking out around you're here so I also get some some other small things for for measuring that's any pipettes I thought I don't know how much you're gonna take but they found out it's it's small at least it's something we come from a hospital stuff I got some of those with a starter kit that I bought a while back okay it's not not to be used it's just to have it yeah I don't use them knodel is trolling a lot in this chat no we got wrenches here to total help trolling if you're never tasted you sweets almani and done you haven't tasted something good that's quite all right well crazy as it sounds I'll tell you what if y'all ever find it I'm hunting for a shrimp flavor shrimp shrimp mm-hmm yeah Mitzpeh believe I know about this some no wait I need to check it flavor art had some yeah only they took it out took it off the market for whatever reason but I want a shrimp Lee I'm not sure we gonna be but perhaps it's gonna be okay I'll look Troy yeah I'm thinking you know and I'm saying I think that myself you know there's shrimp scallops well I serve lobsters just so here's a you got yours and whether I'm down south Southern Mississippi southern Louisiana we're talking Cajun food yeah no beer shrimp crabs that kind of stuff and I've gotten I don't know how many people were questioned that I make a wild trip hey I can I can see that because it doesn't have that fishy taste so you know you're talking you know shellfish basically yeah so it's why it's about meat right maybe that's your problem Roger get out get rid of this stuff with the scales on it and go to the shellfish it's not my problem is your problem I don't that problem with myself it's only the neighbor from runoff and oil we just gonna make a battle like that stuff that was given to you that I got a son too every end of me are gonna send some Solomon all right let's get let's let's take a breather here everybody I am gonna give it sounds like I find it here I'm gonna put the fancy keyword up for it and you have to this keyword in the chat and it's for the $25 gift card giveaway and we'll have the bot pick a winner for this week in this week's is memorial the more you'll type that in oh you're turning into a robot you turned into a robot on us but just put shrimp skins and PGA let it sit in the Sun we'll be talking about that too we will be talking about that shortly after we get yeah you don't worry about the case on a dead lower upper case it don't matter here in the chat - and we'll pick a winner and I like it look at that gone in a couple minutes here if I make sure this is all set up here ah where's my keyword a keyword set yes it is we are good so far we got a bunch of people in here so far and I can't keep up with chat is going so fast yeah well they're all typing in the name Aaron's which is a good deal Keith Keith this here I haven't seen Keaton eaten in ages Keith so one of my bosses up in up in a Boston area oh yeah I've been out but I haven't been working almost a month so far so yeah he's here to check you yeah if if you already seek or not yeah well I get the scars to prove it now they're just painted with ink yeah hiya I miss work and I don't miss work but even when I'm back to work if I'm still on the same bed I'm going the opposite direction keep this - I've been going down south so see that's that about Cajun do you also think about chilly yellow peon war something like that yeah chilly ACK I thought about it but now I like it for an accent chilly I got the unaware chilly and I was hoping it was gonna be hot and it's a relish it's a chili relish it was kind of a dress I know it's so good you know you can get bell pepper and you can get cayenne pepper you can get regular black pepper flavorings you can get all the seasoning basically flavors but the actual shrimp crab or crawfish you can't find those I know what is a place that has crab but I know it sucks to be honest with you yeah I never tried it but from everybody to try it it was it was terrible yeah yeah I gonna check up for you at least a I know I seen it somewhere not long time ago I'd like I'd like to get a good pepper myself I think I think a nice little red pepper behind like a chocolate would be real nice you know just get that little spiciness to it oh boy see how easy we get sidetracked your hand what a bunch of flavored nuts alright last chance type memorial in the chat here if you haven't done it and we're gonna roll this right away for everybody and see who won the this week's $25 gift card and if you are not in our group our Facebook group you

she know when but I can't complain I did before you started doing videos I did win the that flavor Artbox kid oh did you thought you were the winner in that I like it it's a nice short piece for me you know yeah you got it that's nice I guess they got another contest coming out that they're given someone I'm awake with from flavor right I just seems in one of the groups that they were talking about it I'm not gonna do it again cool yeah I don't know worry I don't know why just seen it I wasn't sure what I guess I was just one of them I guess you're putting on a bunch of prizes and stuff so who knows who knows right now we got to get to a Memorial Day I know there's people in our group that are tempting to my there we got their finger on the trigger and they're afraid to pull it take a name of the blacklist I don't know Paulie you just got terrible luck you really don't every way she's here dedicated every stinking week she's been trying and trying and trying see I'm pleading for you Paul I'm trying to make everybody feel sorry for you so maybe I'll give it to you at sound she gonna win yeah I don't know dog didn't say which years or all right so we get I think we got the drops covered that like I said that's my least favorite method of mixing it's the least accurate as far as I'm concerned it can be fairly I could if you use the same thing of everything but like I said it makes a difference so me speaking on though there's some none they got the same problem you get their friend drops so yeah so let's get into the flavorings let's talk about everything that's bad for you oh I guess we should start out with the big one that's really bad for his diacetyl yeah but but the problem with it or we can call it problem man for some years ago this was a big problem but yeah as I remember capela I've changed two or three times since it was a big problem in the historicity every producer have changed their flavorings they have reduced it market it so it ain't a big problem with was earlier also in hideous producing it has been a lot of tests and everything it was yeah the vapors wanted it then a lot of this died still problem is gone away even if I know as in Europe in this tobacco directly TPD system there it's there it says it's gonna be zero the acetate but what I meant by Sarah we don't know if it's 0.1 0.5 in Auto I decide zero at least so Panama and a big scare with diacetyl was popcorn long and everybody knows the story behind that everybody that worked in a popcorn factory all developed big bad long problems one of them died already but I also see a check up in it was some some thing that they make some tests in Netherlands I believe on rats and then it just to say every rest got trouble with it with small amounts but but mainly as the scientists say today it's not possible to say how much you can intake in before it gonna be a problem that's what I was gonna get at the whole point is none of a survey panned the amount that those people in effect or you were paying like you know or breathing in I should say but we know what's bad for you so why do I do it you know but but we can also go back some years and say when the Russian Baker had approximately over 33,000 PPM's died still in the flavoring and also flavor West had two and a half thousand ppm in in there butterscotch then it was a perhaps could be a problem if you then also use this to you get together and then put in the the oldest cappella we won cursed are then we had free with a lot of the other till and then you can get problems if you waited long enough so but every every component is a problem in it it all depends on how much you take in I don't worry nobody gonna die if you if you're using normal flavorings about vaping it for an hour or two never very if it's something and and you vape it in perhaps just that type in what should I say five years ten years two years then perhaps you're gonna get some trouble but we never know and nobody can say yes but that's the whole problem is you know the research and all this is so fresh and so no nobody knows exactly what's going on but we do know that the chemical said we are partly and it's a heck of a lot less and the cigarettes yeah if you're checking the food flavoring for food then they they used at least in in the Europe they they have started approximately 1985 also to control each of these components and set up safety their roots and everything right they are not ready yet and it comes new everyday so it's not possible i don't i think we're never gonna see exactly motor is ok or not they're gonna take the things we know with should be a problem and make some regulation of it yeah and i'm just reading here but the dye ketones by law the testing ever take it and food products is actually compulsory non-compulsory however it is not legally required to be tested in inhalation products correct correct this is why many have struggled to find information I need liquid ser die ketone free that's for daikatana basically which can turn into diacetyl it can't by heat right but it also dies ideal problem it's probably this we don't know but at least I can say if somebody is waiting with a lot of die since some days over some weeks or whatever it is it's not a big problem if you are a normal healthy pupil if you if you have some health trouble then perhaps you're gonna get easier some triggering or something that's not normally the the main thing to keep away from is what we feel what we feel I know about that's fat oil and sugar right we gonna real bad stuff first before we got into army because sugar is bad for you but I mean it's not as bad as bats no but the problem with sugar is how it don't matter vaporize true what we wanna VapoRub see it is by burning for ignore you can yeah it small particles in your lungs and then we get the same problems but I am I'd like to talk about the oils the fats and it's not to be confused with essential oils because most essential oils are safe to vape but the problem is there are a few out there that aren't and so we're gonna talk about that and I want to talk about nets because you get oil from from the Nets and which battalion knows all about he's the best out there for for his nets as far as the oils go that I know of but like I said that well let's talk about the fat so that in lipid pneumonia that's a big scare about bats is labelled mo pneumonia when I know some years ago a lady in USA in fact get troubles because she made all the time I made in us with fats inside and of course made it itself and everything and it get problem it's it's dangerous but also there you need to use some time before you gonna get some problem outlet right but the problem is if it when you get it it's yeah it's very difficult to heal it if it can be done the problem is to people don't know the difference in a lot of people don't take the time you know that's you know like some of these Lorenz products or have young oil because you can ingest them no problem I mean they're made for that you know correct correct even lizard is made from animal fat vegetable glycerin is made from vegetable but what a straight good let me go ahead it's ain't no fad longer it's a sugar alcohol correct so it's a it's a big difference of what this oil and how is the oil is treated you can say if and the oil with or or something with the whale who is destined distilled thankful for the oil is no problem I wanna show so it's a lot a lot of thing but this lipid oil is the problem that's the only will miss the problem in in every flavor is gonna be normally when it's so natural components there it gonna be some oil from its reason some flavors have alcohol and so again site right here a little bit to it I'm reading in the chat I want to show about our allergies and things like peanut vapes and we feeling that the guys to do that we're not doctors I mean I could tell you that there's a difference between somebody's large ik the peanuts and somebody's made from synthetic peanut you know they're they're mimicked in the flavor and there's nothing relative to the penis but that's not guaranteeing that you're not gonna get something that has peanut in it either we're not doctors so we can't at least as far as I'm concerned I don't think we can handle a show like that because we're not medically capable to give the correct advice so what do you what do you think router problem with everything and like that that's not allergies and all this fame yes you don't need to be the exactly the not it could be one of the components in others let's I'm thinkin being whatever other thing right so then you don't get the same same reaction by some people who get have this nut allergy it's not from the nut itself it's from one of the components but look what like what you're doing you're trying to mimic an egg in you use an avocado it's not even there close to an egg but somebody might be allergic to eggs and you're making an egg babe and it's great but then somehow somebody comes all undertaken I've got only know what they could do with fry an egg and put it in PG here's something yeah and then you get your hands on that and then all of a sudden you're in the hospital we can't we can't talk about that but all one of human we know some components is a problem agar gum is is triggering asthma we know this b2 la citt\u00e0 this is is making some head they can and even faint of it and everything but and all the things that could make some skin irritation or inhaling irritation and everything but the trouble is it's normal if you talk about from from a healthy portion then it depends on how much it is true I give you this advice people I'm not a doctor and I'm just gonna tell you what if I had that problem what i would do personally and not telling you to do it but I'm gonna tell you what I would do personally let's say I was allergic to bananas like bob says he's allergic to bananas I won't get that that banana flavoring I will put some on my arm let it sit there for the longest time and see if I got a reaction from it I was that's what I would do now I'm not a doctor I'm not giving me I'm not telling you to do that I'm just telling you what I would do so that covers my ass see why that's my alibi that code see why the doctor would normally say stop weeping don't use it yeah that's that's an easy solution then you got no problems with it but if you really want to make them and you need a reward to try it out something that you need to try try it out yourself it's not not only medical list who says this is okay this is not you need to try it out and find out it's the I I won't either say it you should do it but it's the only way to do it if you want if you vote to to taste something like that at least even if gonna get perhaps some problems for you but it's the only way to do it yeah and even this stuff we're talking about now all we can do is tell you about what we know you know we research and know about it you know and so all this stuff is it's still the research is an internet stuff and it's probably gonna be another 20 years before the research is in honest stuff in all the studies and you know and that you know it's they're getting the groups of people there for their class studies and we're not gonna know we're just not gonna know we're all experimenting here right now but I do know what's a hell of a lot better than what I was doing so it is it's a lot it's a big difference in just the last two three years that's three or four big I tried to check up a bit when I was going on in this di and I find a lot of info about some of it but some difference I happen and I don't know everything but I found out the components it could be bad but the problem is you never know how bad it is because the amounts decide right you can you can in fact you can even vape arsenic believe it or not it's not any big problem oh I've always lived by there's nothing in this world that will kill you if you take it in the right quantity nothing or it's not granite earth that will hurt you if it's in the right quantity you know correct some of you doesn't sir well look at those people over in over in Hawaii with the volcano what about Wafaa yeah well if you take us thinking pinhead pull a lot I know it's coming towards Bernie a little bit ain't gonna kill you you know so correct correct hmm that's correct yeah so it's not there's nothing here that and then too much of anything and on the opposite side too much of anything here kill ya you know but also the same thing this is what what we are using in de I think my mother-in-law that's not the same thing as what you is gonna be controlled by the authorities and everything yeah we need we need to think a bit more about it yourself for me I I feel if I found some flavoring we have stuff I don't like to use then I don't use it whatever if if it's some thumb or whatever I don't see the reason to put it in so then I don't want to use it but that's me Jansen we're gonna get to that about the blood orange F a blood orange is okay to vape when it contains blood orange oil and we know orange oil is left that but it's a way it's processed to correct way you know ways distilled makes a big difference you know we're gonna be we're gonna talk about Nets Nets are heavy in oil but Hector and in fact in this store tobacco just the tobacco leaf could be up to 40% sugar yeah so don't you have at least the two things are most often sugar and the the oil but without gonna happen process racing Roger you did two tests you know the paper test son and tie stuff they're in yes holiness that's out there the cleanest cleanest nuts around so as I said I give gave a picture to Paul or earlier today when I when I take up this is the black Kevin Cavendish yeah from from sticks mix this has made approximately at the change of year this is nearly six months now look at the flavor yeah is it dark no it ain't dark at all I could I could in fact easy I would suppose I could I could read reading a read through it if I if I begin to check it yeah you like that are filtered nice grip tobacco oh you know you're talking about arsenic it's either peach stalls or walnut stones but now I'm not remember but as I said it's not done a problem to wipe it if it's enough amounts you know I think it's peach I think a P a peach pit it has a good amount of arsenic in it the perhaps yeah perhaps I think if I'm remembering correctly but it's perhaps it's something of that in the flavor too yeah never know but at least it's so small it isn't measured so funny is something natural foods like sesame seeds you know I was worried about Blanc in the dig you know at one time somebody gave me a whole bunch of poppy seed rolls which I love you know and that's just loaded with with poppy seeds and I was I hate so much of it I didn't they called me in for a random drug test and I'm like home again am I gonna pass this thing oh my god and I asked and the girl says well I don't know what you might not like really just for me this stuff and before like I'm not gonna make it didn't make it extra terrible for you yeah well I don't find find these buttons off but ya better head back to the of the blood or orange it's all the way like I said it's the distillation of it it's the way it's filtered it's the way it's yeah because a lot of citrus there's a lot of citrus fruits that have those oils compared to other things say you can close to every lemon for example close to every cinnamon it's in fact well right but the problems it isn't as as long as it ain't lipid then it's not only problem yeah well so let's look into the essential oils there's a ton of essential oils out there that are perfectly safe to vape because the way they're processed in the way they're filtered and like you said you shouldn't have any LA's known form they Lawrence is known form they have a ton of them out there and they also have that chart showing the flavors you shouldn't because you gotta watch with these play especially when you get with these bigger flavor companies like Lawrence and stuff they're not making for vaping they're making for cooking and you know it's a big difference between cooking or vaping so you have to be careful of what flavors you buy but if it says essential oil on it you don't be afraid the worst won't be the la is the reasons which one the wisdom may make some flavoring for it for LA oh well it's not in your turn yeah there is some big problems there is phosphoric baking pastry yeah yes for this flavoring company so but it's also solved by some some vaping shops really that's that's the [ __ ] as I see it anyway it was some baby shorts don't care they will do your movie yeah in it flavors are cheap to Welton's button sells all kinds of stuff right you know baking tools but we got some some happening in Norway for some years ago was one guy who bought bought some one Milton because it was cheap and everything yeah but the customer over him get trouble with the scratching - blood in the night and very eating and a lot of problems anyway it was hospital and doctor and everything is in in these things that's what's in fact awesome and flavor and and the biggest problem was if you if you go a got on the web and checked up a search on the flavouring you're gonna find warnings from Witten saying don't use it for raping yeah so a lot of people you know since vaping seems so big they are point out some warnings on what are the flavors look at real flavors do you know right on the side of their bottles smell you know they tell you everything that's in them correct to let you know that they're safe a lot of companies are starting to do that but you have to like I said they everybody starts getting scared when they see essential oil on the bottom and then they get this oil scare well my god I'm gonna get lipid pneumonia well no you're not but you still have to watch you still flavors out there or not but don't get scared if you see essential oils but do your research on it before you buy when we discussed this flavor arch blood orange but what is that the problem we have I see a lot of people and used some flavor of a stuff and everything as I get a new flavor waster you see perhaps each month somebody asks why some II do separates oh yes thankfully it's because of the this oily content to do it see I shouldn't have said anything about cyanide rosh hashanah cavity everybody begin to discuss it I've made flavor west at my own got some stuff just because there's on the input like the yellowcake not the car you know yeah this yellow cake you get the sugar box again frame same with the salted caramel yeah correct same thing but I like it good find something else to use to to get rid of it I don't like to put in myself things I know I don't but it is a big four ounce bottles and tryna get rid of - so if I were a flavor Oh surely they called being flesh sorry I have it yes that I did stopped selling and made a new new type of it and then removed one of this company what's the matter what was it should be a problem it's off incorporate three Willis Reed it's called these component areas are problem oh really yes you're the first one who told me about that I never knew that I buy I like to have it you got some mail from the company no I know what it was stopped in selling I never stopped and they changed it to the Rainier cherry correct right which I have also but the rain here is not this is good the Bing is good it's a big difference oh no oh the Bing is so good because I bought a couple of when I first tried it I so oh my god this is one of the better cherries I ever had you know cuz you know that mixed with the in aware cherries there's two different a nut cherry cherries is a fantastic cherry so I bought another one of them and then they came out to Rainier and oh it's just now it's no comparison there's just two different juries arranged darker and its biggest brighter but is such a such changes have happened in there in the flavor world in the last year she all over it's something is gonna change t pay T FAA also changed a lot of flavors know for a short moment ago I'm just surprised because the war was supposed to be for vaping and then all of a sudden I get flavor that's not good it's surprise but but I'm not sure how it is feed flavor off or if they make everything themselves or I mean I made for you know they're too bad for them I I think I'm not 100% positive but I'm pretty sure I'm not sure so what I think most of them make the receive of how the flavor is gonna be and then get some other company to do it yeah done it depends what are this company used and the son that I found out afterwards it wasn't possible to make it the best and that I need to change it alright well let's get into I don't know if I want to get into the into the food coloring or if I want to talk about a seed of prop you know and acetone would you just basically take your tongs which we kind of discuss but we can touch it shortly this is a trick aside as a twin you can vape you can vape it direct without no health problem and it is some questions on it you know it's it's it's together with us a teal purple real it's gonna be a problem yeah at least is doctor for Solano study to me if if you want to raise the first screen just wipe it is no big problem but if you get it together with the other till probably done they can be indicated rock because as a teal purple ill have a very similar DNA of all the component is as dear Satine and this Osteen is the main part who changes the thing to be the other till alike but as if it's just that himself done it's no problem so yeah I made in here too and it doesn't same thing about the combination but it does say acetyl propane you know in acetone may increase the rate of a chemical reaction of any small trace of diacetyl that may be present so in other words even though did you know somebody tries to get as much the diacetyl out it is a smallest trace then it can cause problems it was one of the main theories was when it start when this DRC Chile was coming up as a big problem then a lot some companies just changed the name without changing to another components that was also some problems who happen and it was discussed in in science at least them but it's changed but this is this two part is very very similar and that's the biggest problem it's easy calm but but I don't see exactly that it should be so big problem this thing's is about the acetyl is known in in bear industry in in in beer making and everything in here right you can read about the Dino steel problematic in India in how many people could pop a bag of popcorn in home and sit and watch a movie I mean it's diacetyl in that you know in but that's it's the amount yeah that you're you're taking it and there is a difference I agree there is the difference between ingestion and inhalation so there's a big difference but allegedly allergic to IP yes there's somebody can be it but some somebody can in fact be it for sucralose to somebody could be there for I think three percent is allergic to PG and one percent the world by this at the Wiggy so look at Lauren Lauren is also finally figured out that she's allergic to PG she's having problems and she wasn't having any problems sold she got sick and her immune system went down that's when everything started kicking in at so so now she does now is goes to max VG and her mixes in problem-solve so yeah there you see there's the only way to do it try to find out test out and and find out yourself if it's functional not it's all the way to do it so I guess we can talk about food colorings now they do before we can even get started on this I want everybody to know that like for instance I got two bottles right here look how dark and how clear this one is just because the bottle is a different color and you think this is natural coloring this is natural coloring there's a big difference between adding food coloring to the flavorings and natural you're up I'm here just just need to open our sides and check off of it get some more color to it here to show everybody here's one that's some Isana reddish side yeah but but normally when you see when it when it comes out eaters who is really really strong in color and the color from light yellow yellow orange some redness some pinkish over to brown an orbitrim darker brown that's a normal it's possible to make it really really really orange with without putting coloring but yeah err perhaps you see it's a bit it's no color in there is just a standard flavoring with aged aged yet but when it comes a really strong flavor that color then for sure is gonna be some some color in there and then it also depends what is which color is it what's the component in the color in flavorings it used a lot this I need to find out and find it back corn syrup is used a lot oh yeah every sweetener yeah no it's also used for a four-color in fact because what is it it's caramelized sugar and then it also come this caramel color the same thing Bo both is it's just heated sugar it's only thing at this I mean and it makes a darker have your color of it is natural flavors cold as what was saying in our group today and it was today even at the time a year time of year the batch can change the flavorings like somebody you know say well I just got this flavoring and it's clear and now I got this next bottle and in its brownish or it has a tan flavor your color to it but I can say only only by nicotine it's normally it comes from a gel it speak it four times a year if you pick something in the winter time if you pick something in the best summer time it's gonna be changed in color whatever right it doesn't matter it's changed in a color and it's a look at the entire thing you saw it's organic stuff it gonna change look at the the review I did and liquid nicotine there Nick salts was bound it was good very good but it was brown and it was well I just bought it and it was clear well yeah it was a whole different batch that they got but the the nicotine itself was good you know what I mean yeah correct that's quite normal right in in a lot of things the color on it don't say if it's good or not the color don't decide it's in iniquity and somebody use chemical cleaning it's just just too pure to make it rain to keep clear but it's not better it's even in fact you're sure because it's the land you have to worry about that is if you had it already and it was clear and turned brown then that's a different story yeah that's it that means you get to sunlight too much heat too much air to watch this too much that and that's when you ruin your neck but it's wrong you purchases from the company ads are unless it's a crappy company outside a NIC is still decent like I said that that liquid nicotine stuff was on a brownish site it would look like let's try and get a car it looked like this it looked like this color and it was perfectly fine you know it's and they also told me it's the way they process is like grad you're saying you know if they don't clean it and clean it and clean it it's gonna be a little bit darker so it varies everything varies about this disc on Lorsch you somebody remembered cut wood first mother milk yeah yeah I remember people say nose and pinky side right no it was whitish why it was bit white and the problem is bundle he used the Flay coloring and this color had a daughter Ramona Nemo he had some component to is not good to inhale at all it was stopped very fast so that's one of the reasons about this dangerous about coloring because when you go at the web and check up about colors you're gonna find warnings about not every flavor but that lost at least most of them when it's used in food how it's gonna be when you are using it inhale then yes or not in its probe problem is if it's pronounced is very propyl paraben is a preservative basically that most food companies use and in their food colorings to to help preserve the flavor preserve the color and it's in a lot of these for eating flavors doesn't belong and I stuff that that we we and consume but from what I read in here it it mimics estrogen and it acts as a hormone and it can screw up your endocrine system can do all kinds of damage see if you're raping it so but that's like I said you know you talking like Wilton's I'm sure they're using some of this in some of their flavors you know about about these colorings I have a lot of codes and what what all the different coatings are and I and I I don't see any color is good to use yeah it is yeah it's perhaps not so dangerous but why do you need it it's not it's it's possible to take it stay away from it without changing anything in taste it doesn't do anything for you you're not gonna if you put brings food coloring in your in your vape you're not gonna sit there and blue blue smoke unless you're right up next to a light and then it's only gonna be a faint blue but if you're just out in the streets because that that light reacts with those molecules said you know you're never gonna get thick and no weight cord and if you want to look pretty in your tank just change the glass put a colored glass in your tank you know I can I want to answer Bob he asked if absent have a distinct natural green color yes it can it depends on on on the amounts of natural herbs is in it I know a DV a decadent vape ish UK have owner is quite green and it's correct we have we have attested it by by documents and everything it has so much of this part of natural pores it gives this green color so it ain't colored by a decadent my gosh in fact yeah like I said don't be afraid of the colored naturally no but very nice is not not roulette or all in need use an assignment blue sign with the blue very hard very you know there's only one thing makeup even possibly get blue out of its like a blueberry or something but and that's not gonna be blue blue correct gonna bring more purple not look at here I'll give you a perfect example [Music] under thing with the but don't just have not just one banana cream la Lawrence makes banana cream this is the clear they also make a yellow which is not good for you because that has food coloring in it they have a watermelon that's clear and then they have one that's colored you get it just be careful I have a colored Laurens here someplace I know I do the yellow because I bought it before I didn't realize it was regular food coloring in it one easy way I found out even it checked which colors we seen Lawrence products you know where it's on Amazon if you check out the products are you gonna find it very easy that its Sun distance red have red number forty a blue number one okay then it's just begin to check up what these things are then you're gonna find very fast out if it could be a possible with different problem or not so I have a list of everything in the Laura and I have a list of yeah we got it we got a chart we don't have the full list but we have a chart in our files in the group that has their saved in that safe to vape layering service but but it's not just Lawrence that everybody to don't forget there there's a lot of companies that have them stuff out there look at correct honey flavor right flavor art I had I love this stuff - I have their Pandora Pandora is like a one of those sweet Portuguese rolls it's delicious and I love it but it's not really good for you it's got acetone and if I remember correctly I don't think that acetone I said to him it's possible acetone right and then acetone acetone - Owen - way because as I told me it's the finger is in paint right exactly right I can say I can tell I also have have leaders from somewhere a CEO somewhere I don't remember exactly know that I can tell for sure by testing using acetone inside we should get ready to sing I'm singer for forum I'm very good with this this tape deck to push on stop and play tape deck oh my god I [Music] still have to twist the rabbit ears on your TV - I also have a 8 track system even your if it's superb it's even better better solved on this DVD jumps off e and every bump or something yeah true that track was superb yeah so these are the tapes Adam you know that's back in the day my gosh people have been eight-track it's twice the size of a cell phone now yeah but then you have something to smack somebody in the add weight chart yeah we uh I think we got just about everything covered here yeah like I said that is the full companies just be careful what you're you're looking at if in doubt ask same with the essential oils most of them are good okay I can say for a group I have I have some info about flavorings the trouble with some of them have a lot of info about this color and what the different color have no components so it's just ask I can try to help at least I don't have it on everything but at least an for four or five hundred different things to use in the market so yeah that's something you'll find something somewhere especially when you know we got some good people here one thing we haven't talked so much about it was nuts everyone one of the biggest problem with nuts it's if you go on the web and check you find out people make something of their own coffee or yeah we go back or whatever it is and I'd use a coffee filter and then it's it's superb and then you see some black gunk yeah it is it's black [ __ ] the gunk yeah it's full of sugar fat you never know whatever I just seen a guy sleep in a tea bag in a little jar PG and just today I seen it on Facebook someplace sir and he said I'm steeping it it's the tea stolen a tea bag and that's my first level of filtering and I'm thinking oh it's not even a filter no it never gonna be okay sure no any that's one more the main reasons I I find and now I can recommend Stix mix yeah yeah okay you have told me a bit about how we do things okay but but at least I can see of my own tests it's pure it's clean its superb look look at this and find on that to be six-month and say it's so clear normally you don't find it that's just boom one way it's like this it's because it's done properly right yeah and there's a lot of companies out there that don't there's a lot of people trying to make you know their own stuff to you know that trying to make their own coffees you're trying to make their own teas they're taking cinnamon sticks and trying to make their own cinnamon and and it's not number one it's not worth my time number two it's not save but but the trouble is they feel it's I it's better taste yeah perhaps it could be but I don't see the reason is some nice taste of anyway when you suddenly need to go to the doctor right then you got some problem so think if you could be a little at least it's a little it's nothing and go buy a flavor it costs you a couple of dollars sister and use 10 hours to each monofin to make some minor part of a flavor you don't you don't gonna run off in any way it's just like just like take a toy you do this in in a bigger scale and it does it properly then it's possible to do something with it but then you need to make it as good as possible if not the gonna be stopped very soon if if say because the main reason if you are making something and at least when you're trying to sell it who is going to be responsible if your customer are going to get the problem yeah risk understand for that who is going to stand in court by by this thing it's you and that that's one thing people at least when I are trying to selling must post think about make this as cute as possible so then you know it won't be any problem if you don't know anything yeah then it ain't sure then then this could be a perhaps a big health problem you never know and then you take the risk use perhaps need to pay a lot for the rest of your life or something so right beat safe at leasts now words professionals do this stuff you know it's down like we go trying to mess with your car or something yeah you know it's right weed so let the professionals handle this up which is nice so we get so many professionals in our group we have a lot of flavor a center group you company owners like Walt Hill steering in the right direction and a lot of things yeah and to say it's so much flavors who's coming oh my gosh he lost last year it's pops out every every week perhaps a new flavoring you can't keep track you know that was one of the arguments one night - you know on ice we started doing the arrest subpoenas site you know mmm people are saying well you don't have all the recipes up there and you know and we have to request a recipe site to make it a little bit easier well why don't you get all that stuff done I says because it'll take me a team of people for over a year to get all those flavors especially you know on specific weights and all this other stuff that they wanted it take us forever to do that stuff it's not it's not possible because it comes to your faucet and you yeah and everything keeps coming no everything every time you turn around there's another flavor company I mean look at the place I said I don't even have you right I don't have any vape trained I don't have any sassani I don't have do you have them you don't have flavors no I have some taste stuff make out look around big show you the camera all this over here is the ceiling just for the shelves not for use I get tons of stuff here I can reach over this way and I can even wait go forward and I can plot all the failure West I can go all over the place I guess stuff all over the place huh in there being the package [ __ ] ain't they open never open they're all open every day one of them I got so much stuff I got it's big it is yes I don't know I don't know but but I remember when I started see there are 16 ounces I'm almost out to look at no that's sweet very very very I think when I started in di at the first number I heard was approximately 700 flavours or something and a short time later I the next most approximately $50 that's so 70 years is not this that many flavor companies out there you know and I got Nooh robbery every day nearly I got even like care she don't even make him anymore but these were Smokies flavorings you know tiny companies coming around you know makin stuff you can't keep up there just like you said I think this is 1,500 more than 1500 companies probably ten yeah for sure and you never know where who is just rebuilding or remixing or whatever it is of all the ones so I know who makes really good flavors that I like to should get some other flavors but that but they're good for me to use if I was selling again I probably use them but for nobody has these flavorings is IDE ID make some nice flavorings oh really good flavors there down and and it's North or South Carolina okay but it's strong super strong too but it doesn't matter if it's strong me it's a taste of it all sides are good they're good very very good but nobody you know for me to be mixed and putting out recipes I can't put out those recipes I'm I don't get people mad at me like you can put out all this Asami and all the people don't want to buy good flavors it's I don't stick with strawberry and cream I don't either I haven't put our strawberry recipe in a long time main reason is I'm living in Europe I need to make easier to get flavors and then you you buy the flavors closer of course when I need to buy something direct from from USA it's gonna take me at least three three weeks to color courses mostly bein what you're trying to say is you want the mountain to come to Mohammed that's also far away in the middle now you gotta use what's available to you that's one thing as long as I find I found out earlier as I said I feel generally the European flavor is a bit more true than the USA types was at least in some of the flavorings that I found it easier to use test as I like and and I'm used to but okay I agree it's some US flavors I need to have - it is yeah I'm just trying to go over the chair making sure if I miss anything they're having their own good time for Evan are smart but not seriously uh yeah you gotta use what's available available to you but I have seen Asus ami their eyes mean some of those flavors I want to get my hands on they get some flavors that nobody else has that I know you know that's the main thing I used them at first time because they had some flaming I never heard about to find anything else and his flavor I bumped it yeah then I tried it I want things I scoured they're around their flavorings and they got some good stuff on there some real good stuff a stronger flavor flavor goes okay so and it's no problem just boy from Australia I've used juice factory in the in Australia in some years - there's some different things but I'm not sure who made their flavorings but they had some of these but it's more standard flavorings again yeah I want some of that vt flavors myself there I would like to get my hands on some some of those flavors everybody's raving off but then again I might get sucked into the hype again like I always do I'm not I don't buy I have got some vta but I'm but mostly its distant changes the lost one I guess was bitter flavoring yeah yeah it's superb to use in some so mixes and everything but I keep hearing about this you know one on one creamy undertones now if that's the newest type out there yeah I tell when one on one like I'm probably five years ago and I wasn't impressed with their flavors back then but I could like everybody else they made some changes and there's a lot of people are bragging about them you know but way back when I wasn't wasn't too crazy but a lot of their stuff but okay I also see problems say so Houston is superb to our handsome but some of this is it I do I love doctor Hanks and cream they're they're straight cream it's advertised it's like a cream frosting but that's not what I get I get a heavy heavy cream it's one of my favorite creams when I want a heavier cream I love it stuff that's only on like one or two Hanks and flavors but that cream is out of this world it's really good I tasted some of them earlier this I think it was his peach and and one other thing quite nice exactly that one because it was sad it was okay but all the phones know I loved I loved coffee for me I love the cream I really do I love a lot of their banks and cream it's one of my favorite cream cos I found too much of this Asian he uses that they can use lighter and and get it to light up right so then I don't want to use anything of this more than necessary should I say try to use European most possible for 20 minutes left here people you got any questions for us while we're in here - I think we got mostly everything covered like I said we talked about the Nets tell us how you love the cream tie shut up for you you know you can do it that rich you know you can stick that wrench tight I like it what can I tell you I like I like sticks mix - I mean that's okay for me to talk about that stuff though but but you also also know in Germany I think it's six or seven different flavor companies yeah who is into vaping I have contact with some of them but but not everybody have yeah shipping for to foreign countries then but yeah it's it's so fun there at least I try it some of them but same thing you can also have three or four big ones you say this what is called truly more something I have a couple of flavors but is it is it the reboot or is it I have no oh yeah I don't have a clue where they where they come from be honest with you that's totally unknown mean in Europe whatever yeah and then they don't have any don't reach or or European vendor for it then it's lots of interesting you don't hear much about purely my name when I first started pushing them out there you were hearing a lot about them but you don't hear you know the flavors I ever okay I can't complain about them but I'm not like my Hang Seng cream over I'm good the ones I have I don't have it's not a revenge expenses is not a rebrand you're sure have you documented it I can picture it happened what's the same thing if you begin to check most of these flavor companies buys flavor from others they make the they make the component to receive three or four major major companies out there I mean there's one over in the EU we got two of them here that I know of once mother Murphy's the other ones there's someone in a big international company that they for the life of me I can never remember their name but they are absolutely huge they make like a places like mother Murphy's so it makes flavorings for like Kellogg's and Nabisco and all the big companies food companies and they they're the ones that provide the flavoring for them but this other company makes them like aunt we're not thinking the name of that company either it's huge that's quite normal that's nice yeah it's all over Robert but they get like you said they get their flavorings you know these companies get their flavorings made by them in their name you know I'm pretty sure like I said I'm not positive about labora but I'm my guess is I think mother Murphy's is providing for them I'm not positive it could be it could be a whole lot of things you know I know you know even some of the smaller flavor companies that do do you have one or two chemists work for them and then they even the smaller ones are providing for other people too so for it's like a big chain it's just goes down and down and down so you don't believe it's not possible dirty to find it out that way yeah it's just just to use this brand as if you like you tell and be happy with it feeling so plus the matarese there's a there's a lot of work goes into making flavorings there's a lot of research I think the R&D is probably the biggest out of everything you know you can't just turn around and say I'm gonna make a blueberry you know and then though these things change during the time of year tastes of everything changes you know you can buy it I'm not quite sure of the numbers no but a blueberry if it is made approximately of I counted it one time I think it was approximately sixty or seventy different compounds yeah a blueberry flavor is made approximately about ten to twenty and you also got to take into consideration like you got a a blueberry that's like here in Pennsylvania compared to a blueberry that's in California they're two different tastes and that company doesn't want to make in California the Pennsylvania blueberry because the people in California uses it on blueberry you know alright you know what I mean they want that taste they don't want this blueberry taste here alright which makes a difference something we say about this bilberry bilberry is the scandinavian blueberry right I never never heard it I never heard it any time already it's anywhere before I started vaping and working with DI and then I found it out it's a this is the Scandinavian or Northern Europe blue bar and it's a much darker darker blueberry than what you would get here in my neck yes Brad quite red meat in it yeah but like I use bilberry you know with my blueberries here because it just gives us such a nice dark rounded flavor it's beautiful you know 100 mix wheat bilberries close to a stone door if you're gonna make a good blueberry yeah at least in my opinion that's the same thing as we say with this rosehip - also the same stuff not not something to sit in vapor Oh see butt-kickin elder flavour to give you the more butcher to say it's or taste or whatever it is the hype seems Afghan down in our so does a really quirky yeah breathe it works it it is not gonna it's effervescent it's a it's never besan it's not gonna give you you're not gonna vape in and get bubbles in your mouth but it'll give you a tingling sensation on your tongue it does work I don't think the hype is over it's just that the few people that got it or happy with it and keeping their mouths shut but I guess I know I don't know but it works one thing about it I believe people don't so for about try to use it approximate around to a percentage and that's a magic number that's imagine boom you don't feel so much reviews it in free and off you don't feel so much near to approximately to just the correct amount of yeah it is I don't know why I don't know why that magic number it is but that's what it is and I was shocked first time and it works but citrus Oh voiceover good oh my goodness hey ty yeah you people re you're something yeah we know am I gonna do it then what am I gonna do with them [Laughter] picture and I'm running around the Argonne not so bad words from his mouth because at least be clean this roads sitting with this little bubble maker in his mouth trying to blow the vape through it herckel Marian Solomon yeah why not about for ya perhaps perhaps it could be nice yeah it's an emergency emergency emergency I just died again throw a spare now oh I'm two for two what's going on here what's going on oh this this soda base for for a real favor everybody heard about TFA champ on it should give some fees for me it it gives so little it's not me in need for it in fact perhaps you could help in in some other flavors as kuva lummox or whatever but it also give me a bit of this great taste of it it was the same same thing with Univera sparkling wine it's more fizz in it but it also gives some great taste of it yeah the I don't get mushed a Saturn are it's sort of a second a tiny taste is something again even Oh tiny tiny I think it's so great being that it's not much it's a if you use it close to in every mix you won't use it then you're gonna mask this taste so it's not it's not a heart it's perhaps there perhaps the best to the best CC taste you can find today at least yeah he didn't she hell of a job with it yeah all the new flavors he's coming out with that holiday pie oh my goodness I like that stuff I think champagne is the same thing it's berry and a grape I mean it the best chances we had Adam there but they're not comparison to this soda bass in my house I you might want to add I don't have you tried I haven't tried it yet have you tried to add like sparkling wine to the soda base yeah under get more grape flavor just more grape flavor that's a no of course you're gonna get more filler but but they feels like it dies fast I found out in tests yeah so I don't I don't try to use ball firm in dynamics I think it's also there as in in lot of other things if you if used too much of one component than economies probably if you don't know they don't know the components so it's not easy to say oh it's gonna mean if it's gonna mute a lot but I feel at least in California no official DFA bad sorry I tried my feet I feel the same thing I'm reading what Bob Susie Trey he's naturally mental because he's of the expected mint flavor you don't get mint flavor from menthol if you buy menthol I have regular menthol crystals that I dilute myself there is no mint flavor to it it's just strict mint all right if you want a menthol that has I'm gonna talk about company Roger don't like it's a flavor west extreme ice that's a menthol with it's got peppermint spearmint and wintergreen mixed into it and just really nice amounts it's a really nice at least for me really nice menthol mint I think it's also mint in in the flavor if I were ought to whole are most also have some minty taste it's got a tiny bit of a mini taste but I just get it off note with it I you know I got a 30ml bottle here and I tried and try it and try it with it and I just get an off nope what did I use it a few times just adjust to taste it I'm in love with the ws 23 dome that is the cleanest coolest but I'm being smarter than you I found out I bought just a 10 mil bottle you have four tiers I got a 13 yeah I followed all the FFA hype you know all that came around and I got suffered it was the best thing is the best thing no it's not it's it's cooling some people enjoy but I just get an off taste to it zippy corneum vaping she would taste like if index correct yes yeah yeah no you're right I just don't like it they just did a poor job with it really did he is it once can't really place it yeah I just I don't know but this ws 23 oh my goodness I don't know why I never had it before what wasn't available here for the longest time but yeah I love that stuff you know you could just make cold you want cool you get cool you want cold you get cold you want a brain freeze you can get brain freeze well yeah but if you want mint you add your own mint to it you know what I mean it's it's just perfect let it under get the coldness in the whole mouth yeah we mean COLLADA you get it more on the front of the tongue yeah and we think cloudy you get that at least for me if I'm vaping too much if I put too much of a percentage of glad if I'm gonna get a colder yeah I get chest pain I need actually oh goodness you know it sits in my chest I know somebody got it but once I heard somebody get problem with me as to antifreeze so it's it depends of it I don't have a proud little problems but I don't see any problem and I know that lots yeah I used to be a stunt theory yes the battle dovetails everybody keeps some I had to build up a tolerance just stuff like you know you you got to eat this you got a drink you know you got to drink this build up a tolerance what I don't like it why do I have to build a tolerance of do it I like stuff that I like I don't want to force myself to have to like something you know it's just want to know can the King gets the sober in the liquids I never tasted candy King and I'm never gonna buy or taste it yeah maybe mainly because its trademark or a fragment but Malik acids perhaps perhaps you could use some citric acid and put in some top tartaric acid w he called or you can also use a bit bit colada or vs 23 and Dan you gotta taste it oh you can you can do it you can do it no problem I have a motto tartaric acid I don't even know how safe that is to vape so sure I'm not found anything who says it's okay but I don't find anything you say it's not right yeah that's where I'm at so but I that's that's what gives you the malic acid is the sour citric acid is tart but when you but when you mix it with malic acid it gives that malic acid that initial boost to get the the sourness L in the tartaric acid is just put sour on steroids is what it does sense but I'm sure that's where they where they get it from but that's exactly with what tartness sour is sweet and tart is malik and citric acid but the problem in all this these things us solver or Malik or see if we can everything yeah it's very easy to get muted flavors you know short wine yeah especially we use it why I to believe you can I can have it somewhere in in six months after oh it's no problem I got a banana recipe somebody gave me that uses an extreme amount of citric acid I mean I'm tired I like one drop per milliliter you know add into it was his recipe and that's a lot so you're looking at I don't know what the percentage of B anti-prom it's got to be up around three or four percent somewhere in that neighborhood but in it's fantastic the juice is fantastic but it only lasts about three weeks three weeks you're done you know then it mutes write down the banana goes nothing you know you go from banana the banana skin yeah the main trouble with that made every additive is the kernel it's gonna mute or or disappear quite fast anyway at least if you use a bit too much and it's not a lot of Italy you need before it gonna get make some trouble so as I said before if you can't make a good good mix without it then it's never gonna be better with it you can change chicken after some of some of the parts of the flavor but not the main yeah mix you can tell so I got a mix thing that I I'm looking at hands as well Speer I got a recipe that's similar to that but I remember it I had a little bit of Hingham in it and I gotta get rid of it because it's it's muted ami muted a I mean after about two months recipes good it's tasty but I got I gotta make an adjustment to it it's like to make it last lemon fades and it's all but I think I'm forcing it to fade a little bit more than it should so lemons hard lemons lemons hard strawberries hard fire percent sucrose why didn't use 15 yeah it's the same thing it does matter you haven't waited till it steeps down away so just yeah just pop it a sugar cube in your mouth yep and that's all you're done yeah feel the whole mouth with sugar like groups that's a you know pack way back when we were fighting and fighting fighting for to get that fizziness in your mouth it's all everybody just throw a couple pop rocks in your mouth and say you're done there you go you got all that busyness you want so but we're here two hours anybody got any last-minute questions whereas someone get the heck out of here I

The first brand I like to talk to you about is Javazen, which\nmay become a new part of your morning routine. Their brand slogan is health of\ntea power of coffee, and how is that? Well Javazen takes coffee beans and blends them\nwith teas and then adds in superfoods. So you get the benefits of the caffeine\nin coffee the antioxidants in tea and the nutrients in superfoods. There are three\nproducts in their line each with a different purpose. You have boost, balance\nand relax. So you can get all three and use them based on the time of day for your\nmood. Their blends are a hundred percent organic and you can brew it just like\nyou would a regular cup of coffee. Now I'd like to talk about another brand who\nhas a different spin on the conventional and that Lawless Jerky. So what makes\nthem so different you might ask,  it's their process and their flavors. All jerky is\nmade in small batches with unique flavor profiles. They have Japanese Curry, Honey\nChipotle, Pho. Seven flavors in total but all that all super delicious. The\nbrand only uses a hundred percent grass fed beef making a healthier sustainable\nand more humane, no additives, no preservatives here. Now let's talk about\nfunctional beverages again which are all the rage these days I mean really why\ndrink water anymore right let's talk about Healthee. Healthee is a brand that\ncreates turmeric drinks. We have turmeric extract, turmeric powder but have you had\na  turmeric drink? It has the same benefits of your supplements. It's an\nantioxidant, anti-inflammatory and it's detoxifying. So now you can have\nit drink form to take with you on the go or have it with a meal to give you a\nnice boost throughout the day.

Thats right and nutrient dense. What are you planning on doing with all those. I got my daily supplement there Kayla.\nI got to swallow all these pills. Or maybe I can help you  cause now there's a way you can\nspray your vitamins. Did  you say spray? Yes Spray.
