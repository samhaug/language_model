{"ujlzxde5q9w": "usually i'm high as [ __ ] when i'm eating the candy not eating the candy to get high as [ __ ] [Music] we have a snow day today here in pennsylvania i physically cannot make it outside of my house to ship out any of the orders so i'm just gonna get astronomically high what better way to celebrate a snow day am i right on this table right here i have a bunch of edibles that equal a thousand milligrams of thc i have this medicated chocolate bar it is 400 milligrams of thc in it i have the smaller chocolate bar that has 200 milligrams of thc in it i have a medicated nerds rope here with 220 milligrams of thc in it that equals 820 milligrams for anyone who is in the slow classes and then right here i got a bunch of 15 milligram chocolate bears this is 12 chocolate bears at 15 milligrams a piece that's 180 milligrams all of this combined is gonna be at least one thousand milligrams of thc i rounded down for all of these so it's actually a little bit higher but enough talk and let's get started first i'm gonna start with the 200 milligrams medicated s'mores bar down the hatch i'm gonna need some water that tastes pretty weedy not gonna last all right 200 milligrams down 800 to go i really should have titled this video how to ruin your day all right this is the 400 milligram chocolate bar cookies and cream by the way um i hate that like mild weedy taste you get from edibles it's weird how it tastes good and then like every five bites you're like oh wait i just ate a nug and then you like start eating again you're like oh wait no it actually does taste pretty good oh wait no there's some weed it's like eating a candy salad ugh i do have to say though edibles made with this lit tastes so much better than edibles made with rso oh all right let's finish this white chocolate off so we can move on to the next ah so much chocolate i had to wash it down we can get like a tongue ulcer from this jesus christ all right you guys i've consumed 600 milligrams of thc now i am going to work on the nerds rope sick of eating all this chocolate at least mix up the flavor a little bit these are some ghetto ass nerds rope i mean but they taste fire this is a lot of candy to eat not that i've never eaten this much candy but usually i'm high as [ __ ] when i'm eating the candy not eating the candy to get high as [ __ ] i'm not done eating all the edibles so i'm gonna start this time right now just so i have an idea for when it's gonna kick in because i'm over 600 milligrams at this point probably closer to seven or eight so it's gonna hit me like a brick wall all right let's finish this oh i really should have gotten high before i filmed this video just to make the eating of the candy a little bit easier all right you guys i still got to finish all this nerd drip and all this chocolate and then we are done eating a thousand milligrams all right i'm gonna switch to the chocolate a little bit try to mix up these flavors these little bears are so small i'm just gonna try to pop them like little pills that's one that's two all right this is three these little chocolate bears are for sure the worst tasting edible uh just trying to like chew it and swallow it not trying to let it touch my tongue at all pause keep going those ones really taste horrible holy crap six more to go i'm halfway done the chocolate bears i honestly think if i eat six more of those straight i'm gonna throw up so we're switching back to the nerd drip oh my god i'm just gonna start sandwiching these chocolates in between the rest of the nerd trope ugh these ones stay so bad i don't know if it's just because the amount of distillate that's in the chocolate but holy crap i can hardly get these ones down number ten number 11 and the last one number 12. dude i'm not kidding those ones tasted so bad all that's left are these two little bites of nerds and i have consumed a thousand milligrams of thc bottoms up all right you guys i just consumed a total of 1 000 milligrams of thc between all of those edibles now it's the waiting game just gotta wait for them to kick in should be about an hour and a half or so but i'll let you know as soon as it kicks in thanks to my handy-dandy timer before this when it comes to edibles the most amount of thc i've ever consumed in one sitting was 500 milligrams so this is going to be twice the highest amount of thc i've ever consumed at one time but while i wait for these edibles to kick in let me introduce today's sponsor me make sure you guys check out my online headshot pp online shop you guys it is the number one online headshot on the internet anything you find at your normal head shop you can find at pponlineshop.com i got rigs torches water pipes hand pipes carb caps bangers anything you need besides weed i gotcha and not only are you supporting a content creator you like but you're also supporting a small business and they say that supporting small businesses is important so [ __ ] you jeff bezos there's a new jeff in town he's gonna be taking your internet sales bezos but since i made these edibles myself i know i'm about to have a real thousand milligram experience my big problem with buying edibles i just don't trust that people put an accurate amount of thc that they say they do in the edible it might be more it might be less i don't want it to be more i don't want it to be less i want it to be exactly what i know it to be so i believe if i make them myself i get the best idea for how potent they really are going to be but enough talk and i'm going to come back to you guys in a couple minutes with a little update let you know how i'm feeling all right you guys we are an hour and 20 minutes into the edible and i'm already feeling pretty lit so i'm nervous to where this day's gonna take me usually you don't really feel the full effects of an edible for at least an hour and a half if not two hours so the next 40 minutes are going to be very interesting to me because i'm getting a little bit higher every second i just finished shoveling all the snow outside and i felt like i was having a race against time because i do as soon as this edible kicked in it was gonna be hard to move that snow so i banged it out i'm very thankful for that but now i'm just gonna sit here and wait to see how this edible kicks in because the next 40 minutes are really telling on how the rest of my day's gonna go i see this going three ways the first way i've already peaked and i'm not going to get any higher than i just gotten right now i find that very unlikely option two i get way too high and i get to the point where i'm uncomfortable having anxiety attack and possibly even sick option two is also unlikely but more likely and then there's option three which is the one i'm really hoping for i hit that like perfect ideal super baked out of my mind astronomically high feeling that we all know and love you know that first time you got stupid high and you were just like holy crap i love this feeling that's the feeling i'm chasing today i'm really shooting for that third scenario right now i think it's about to be a fun day all right you guys time check it has been an hour and 41 minutes i don't know if that's in focus but it's safe to say i boarded my flight and i'm taking off to big town holy [ __ ] i'm high and i'm not in focus i don't think why am i whispering i have no one to hide from i know someone's probably gonna mention it at some point but just a heads up you guys i have a weird superpower where my eyes do not get red they get like really baggy and they'll get like really low but they just do not get red maybe after a thousand milligrams they will be but usually like smoke has to get in my eyes for them to get red like it's not a cannabis reaction it's something weirdly hereditary i think i got it from my dad my brother has the same thing so it's just our weird superpower i don't even know what to do when i'm this high like my brain is just going a mile a minute in all these weird directions just thinking all the stupid [ __ ] oh my god i really don't know how entertaining this is to watch so even let me know if this is gonna be a fun video for you guys if you guys want to see me eat an absurd amount of edibles and film the reaction again leave a comment let me know i think next time i want to do some sort of variation of like i ate x amount of edibles and did x so give me ideas here we are in the smoke room i figured while i let this edible kick in i'll show you some of the new stuff i've gotten let's see what i got in here that i can show off for those of you who don't know this is what you use to make most edibles this is distillate and this is rso rso stands for rick simpson oil there's a lot of information about this you can do your own googling i'm not gonna sit here and explain it while i'm high as [ __ ] but these two extracts are what's in most edibles if it's not can of butter let me show you some of this weed i've been smoking on this strain right here is called notorious it is absolutely beautiful nice dense nugs it was testing it like 30 thca i picked up a quarter and the entire thing looked like this it is truly some beautiful weed this strains pretty nuts it's called plum crazy by gti this is one of the many reasons why i don't shop based off of the thc potency you guys a lot of people be turned off to this strain just because they see 16 a lot of times under 20 people just do not want to buy it but personally weed isn't all about just the thc percentage and the amount of high you get i appreciate the beauty the smell and the aspect of cannabis all in all and this [ __ ] right here is some pretty ass weed and it smells great smokes great it is a great strain to have definitely not the craziest put you on your ash stream but i have a thousand milligram edibles for that but look how beautiful this weed is man it's just the most perfect mix of purple green and just white trichomes bursting out everywhere last strain i'm going to show you is this lemon g from moxie to be honest the strain isn't the craziest one i've seen from moxie but i really like the strain lemon g so i'm not really complaining too much nothing really worth bragging about but definitely not bad weed at all all right but real quick i want to show you this thing called the wacket grinder you guys it is an electronic grinder with these little beads in it that spin around and grind up your weed you can get it as chunky or as powdery as you want and look how easy this is to grind up weed boom nice and chunky if you want a little bit more powdery just run it for a couple more seconds super easy just pick the stems right out [Applause] and perfect for a joint all right i'll give you a little piper update my treat i'm gonna treat it sit do a tornado tornado good girl i love this dog good girl so as you can see piper is doing well living the dream that's my dog all right you guys we have passed the two hour mark and it's about two hours and ten minutes and i'm still getting higher but i'm tired as [ __ ] i'm more of like just like a sluggish stoned not like a giggly like big tie as much as i expected it to be at least i just want to take a nap man i am tired i'm surprised the munchies haven't kicked in yet but that's probably because i ate all that candy just to get high so like my stomach just does not want any food right now but i'm gonna sit my ass on this couch turn on the tv for a couple minutes chill with my puppy and try not to fall asleep okay i fell asleep so did piper i don't know for how long it's three hours and 20 minutes since i ate the edible netflix hit me with the are you still watching i was watching our carly this show is [ __ ] fire isn't it paper she actually doesn't like it that much apparently well i'm tired and really high i'm kind of seeing like 2d slash 3d i'm seeing like two and a half d i think it's time i take a dab see if that kind of helps even out this high a little bit sorry this video is kind of all over the place but that's just kind of where my head is at right now so that's what you're gonna get in this video about to take a dab on this antidote recycler i love the function on this little guy about to finish up this lime skunk i've been working on this stuff looks beautiful i love this strain if you've been watching me for a while you remember back in the day i was all about the strain when i first got my medical card and i still like it to this day so that's that's a statement all right you guys first dab after a thousand milligrams let's see how this goes [Music] oh that's terpy god damn oh my god that that dab did the trick oh my god i'm feeling way higher than i did just off the edible smoking on top of an edible definitely get you higher i don't know if it's because that stream was a sativa or if it was just because i dabbed in general but i feel much less groggy than i did before death have a little bit of a turp tickle in my throat now oh my god this lime skunk is so flavorful that even before you put the cap on it gives you a little bit of a throw tickle but i'm glad i did that i feel like first on the edible i was starting a little anxious and i was getting really tired and i felt like i was just kind of like getting into like a little shell and after i took that dab i feel like i just like burst it out of a cocoon a butterfly and i'm just like perfectly high and exactly how i want to be and i'm ready for a good rest of the day i feel like this high is a long while to last but i feel like the ride is almost over i feel like the crazy part of it is done i feel like the come on is really the craziest part when you're like oh my god how high is it gonna get me how much higher am i gonna get how much higher am i gonna get i feel like i've hit my peak so i don't think i'm gonna get too much higher than i am now but we will see we're three hours and 38 minutes in as i say that all right it has been four hours since i've eaten the edible and that means i've been high for about two and a half hours and the munchies have finally kicked in i am not gonna be able to wait for dinner so i'm about to eat real quick i might be putting you guys on to something but some of you guys probably have done this before i call this a torch s'more so you get two marshmallows put them on a stick you get your torch [Applause] and there you have it y'all torch more just look at that oh my goodness fire i'm high so yeah you guys this morning players are following me around it's cracking me up all this edible's really done is got me to take a nap and hang out with my dog all day maybe i'll take a couple rips out of the peak pro i don't think this really counts as smoking you just get kinda high i mean it gets you high but it does not get you as high as a real dab does nothing gets you high like an authentic dab with a rig and a torch the peak definitely serves its purpose it's a great mobile dabbing device definitely better than bringing a torch anywhere and it gets you pretty darn high but if you dab just off a peak for a week and then take a dab off a raid you're going to be so much higher off of that one dab off the rig than you are off the peak or at least that's for me speaking of my experience but my favorite thing about the peak compared to some of the other e-rigs is the app i just think it has so much custom ability to it it's literally insane you can customize your own heat profile and what color you want set and then they have this little lantern mode when you're not using it where it'll do all these crazy colors this is the disco setting change the lighting in here a little bit that'll help show off the colors a little better that's just something fun it's nothing crazy you can change it to literally any color you want on the spin wheel that's fun it's cool to play with when you're high it's like getting a new iphone but people have asked me to do a review on this and honestly i just haven't used it enough to do a review on it i don't like to do a review on something until i've like really delved into it and feel like i have enough information where i can share it and as you can see down there i've only taken like 30 something dabs out of this but i'm about to take a dab with this gmo wax the app reads the temperature of the chamber which is pretty cool but it's time to smoke uh it never ends there we go it's not even over and that's the puffco p pro and i have the pro on my website pponlineshop.com if you want to check it out they sell fast but i try to get them as often as i can and let me know if you think i should really dump into this puffco peek and make a youtube video about it i still need to use it more maybe we'll take a couple more dabs later i feel like this is idiot proof and i feel like an idiot right now my brain is just going all over the place i can hardly think straight look at this weird ass angle i have the youtube video set up at like everything's a mess right now you guys let me try to fix my life that's how i feel peak i am so high i'm looking at two cameras right now two of them five pound cameras you see let's open some snaps hey found out this guy's name real quick paper you're ruining a moment big shout out to you peter thank you for the support much appreciated i'm definitely gonna need luck with this thousand milligram edible the dabs didn't help maybe they did what do you think i was asking paper i posted it about how i was taking an edible so a lot of them are just messages i appreciate the messages i'm not trying to sound like i don't but i figured i'd like show pictures and stuff let's see what else is popping on the webs no power oh my god this is so sad oh my god i feel horrible i shouldn't have opened my snapchats when i was this high this made me really upset i have to respond what day is it [ __ ] thursday thursday the 18th i really i had to look it's thursday february 18th right now and a couple days ago texas got hit with this horrible storm and a lot of my followers are from texas and i know a lot of people from texas i said this in previous videos my girlfriend and i were in a long distance relationship and she lived in dallas so i've been to dallas a bunch of times so it really makes me feel horrible to see what they're going through right now and i made a post about it today on my story and people are responding to it obviously and uh makes me feel so shitty hopefully you guys are watching this a few days in the future and everything like instantly came back on like tomorrow morning and it's not even an issue anymore but currently i have heartbroken for everybody at texas and i hope that the power comes back on soon should i try one more see if it's any better hey someone else got a piece from me thank you so much for the support homie oh and he's dabbing on some fire okay i see you bro i see you bro all right this edible took a minute to hit me but it's hit me all right the rest are just text messages and i like to be coherent when i read those so we're just gonna leave them for now but make sure you follow me on snapchat pot underscore porn i also have pot.porn but my main one is pot underscore porn i'll put a little screen code thing in here like they have in all the restaurants now but if you just type in pot underscore porn you'll find me sounded like a weird seductive ad all right we are reaching the six hour mark i don't know if i'm showing that properly but it has just been about six hours since i've eaten edibles i am preparing dinner right now making sesame chicken letting the chicken marinate in the fridge i definitely still feel high as [ __ ] but i don't feel like i'm any higher than i was when i last caught up with you guys but i also don't remember the last clip before this so that's kind of where i'm at in life i've just doubled the biggest edible dose i've ever taken and i'm doing fine i'm about to make dinner smoke some more weed and that's gonna be the rest of my day but i feel like edibles really do have a peak high because every time i've seen somebody say they've had a thousand milligram edible before i've been like no way that just doesn't seem possible and like i feel like that would just be like another level of high like you're gonna be tripping balls but i just had a thousand milligrams and it's not too much crazier than the 500 milligrams to be honest like i smoked on top of it i wasn't dying like it's at least fully been in my system activated for four and a half hours so i'm gonna say i've just fired at this point it's just a longer high if anything i feel like by a 200 milligram edible piper hush fine i'll give you this room but as i was saying i feel like if i had a 200 milligram edible i would have been maybe not as high and not as long of a high but it wouldn't have been too much crazier than this but also do not try this at home my tolerance is crazy high if you don't have a crazy high tolerance or if you don't smoke a lot of weed you should not try this at home probably should have said that earlier in the video but regardless take it from me don't try this at home it's a waste of money and waste of time but since it was a snow day what better thing to do than eat a thousand milligrams of edibles and take a bunch of dabs gonna end this video while i was taking a dab of this bubble of course sugar i'm just gonna throw it right in the peak got the peak heating up again if you want to get one of these for yourself you can check out my website pponlinechop.com oh it's hot it's ready to go oh yeah that's nice oh my god this thing's hitting all right this is one of the better tests i've gotten off of this peak i [ __ ] with it yeah gotta love the peak fam dabbing of the future but that's gonna be the video you guys click like if you enjoyed this video if you made it this far you probably did and don't forget to subscribe for more videos we got a bunch more on the way leave a comment let me know if you have any crazy edible stories i'd love to hear them i've definitely gotten a lot higher off of a lower dose before but my tolerance is so high right now that i've been like training for this this is nothing if i took a week off of smoking and tried this again it would be a whole nother story i would be [ __ ] rocked and make sure you check out my website pponlineshop.com it's the number one online headshot on the internet it's only getting doper every week i got new products coming all the time but that's the video you guys 1000 milligrams later my name is jeff peace", "FI73gfwO1Lk": "[Music] another video today is gonna be a very different type of video as I've never done one of these before so I'm gonna try this out hopefully everything works out the way I have it in my head so let's get right into the video guys without further ado today is going to be actually a edible review so I'm not personally me myself I'm not a huge edible fan just because of how long the effects last how long they take to come on and a bunch of other factors just doesn't really make me a fan of it me personally when I like to use cannabis I like to know when I'm gonna be high for how long I'm gonna be high and you know I can plan my day around that with edibles it's kind of like once you take the edible and once it's in full effect you're kind of just basically useless as a person that's how you know heavy the effects are for metals for me personally I mean I'm speaking from my point of view everyone has a different tolerance everyone has different experiences so that's why I don't eat or use edibles that much but today's review is going to be hopefully you guys can see that on camera they're one of these shatter bars and this one is 250 milligrams of THC hopefully you guys can read that information hopefully it's focused hopefully the camera is focusing but yeah so this is a vegan shatter bar because that's the only one they had left so I just bought that one this one's two hundred and fifty milligrams of THC ten point four milligrams per square so when you open this up I'll show you guys it it's divided into little squares this one is sugar-free dark choc this one is an indica so they actually have a sativa and an indica bar I'm not sure how that affects I might have to try this a tea go on and see the difference but I've actually tried this one before and I know how it affects me so I roughly know what's gonna happen after I eat this but yeah this one is purple kush and there is 24 pieces in this bar so hopefully you guys can see that hopefully you guys can read that but yeah without further ado I'll just read like the ingredients here unsweetened chocolate sweetener cocoa butter soy lecithin natural vanilla flavor and yeah that's basically it it gives you the nutritional value here on the back it says that there is a lab test result so for the THC percentage it is 60 7.5% the THC a is zero point zero eighty percent THC V is a hunt one point twenty percent the CBN is zero point four hundred and fifty percent the CBD is zero point one thirty five percent the CBC is one point sixteen percent and the CBG is one point ninety two percent so I'll show you guys that there it's just on the back hopefully you guys can see that oh yeah let's get right into this review I'm gonna open this bad boy up show you guys what we're dealing in here and as I'm opening this up and showing you guys a lot of people might not be familiar with edibles or how they work and how they affect you I'll give you a brief rundown on how they work basically so what you have to do in order to make edibles is you have to use obviously cannabis or cannabis derived product like shatter I believe actually that's what they use to make these is they actually use shatter from purple kush or whatever it is to make the bar so you'd have to use shatter hash Keef something with a lot of cannabinoids in it obviously and what you have to do is decarboxylate the cannabis product whatever you're using the bud you know how shatter or whatever you're gonna be using you have to decarboxylate it now I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to the actual science and how this stuff works but if you are interested just type in deep decarboxylation on google and it will give you a description on what it is exactly doing it has something to do with removing a carbon atom from the molecules or something along those lines I don't want to butcher the sign so I'm not gonna try and explain it but so basically you have to decarboxylate your cannabis make the edibles and what happens is it's it's different than smoking in the sense of when you smoke cannabis the witch is your smoking the THC the CBD and all the cannabinoids obviously so the THC which is known as Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol is present in the plant so when you smoke that the Delta 9 THC or Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol gets absorbed into the lungs then it goes into your bloodstream and then it gets processed that way and when you smoke obviously the effects come on immediately after the thing with edibles is once you eat the Delta 9 THC when your body starts to obviously break down the food and process it and digest it it turns that Delta 9 THC into 11 hydroxy THC or 11 hydroxy tetrahydrocannabinol so if you didn't know that it actually turns THC into a totally different compound which is why edibles lasts so long and is why like their effects are very very potent so I just want to give you guys that little bit of information if you weren't aware of that and yeah I'll show you guys the bar so this is like the little wrapping that it kind of comes in here I guess that's like their little logo or whatever whatever that means I don't even know what it says but yeah so and here she is there is the chocolate bar that we're dealing with so each square is ten point four milligrams of THC the entire bar is 250 milligrams of THC so now I was thinking about this before the video but I'll just say it to you guys as well I wasn't sure if I wanted to take the entire bar or if I wanted to eat half of it I mean it wouldn't really be an edible review if you only ate half because then you're not really getting the full effects so I'm just gonna leave this camera recording I'm gonna start eating this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour and hour and a half and I will tell you guys how I'm feeling how the effects are how actually I'm gonna start eating it now and I'll tell you how it tastes as well just cuz just kind of giving you an overall review of the product itself because some edibles taste like complete [ __ ] but then the effects are amazing and then some people make like really gourmet edibles that taste amazing and also the effects are there as well so I'm gonna try it now or shut up so there's one little square I know it's chocolate you kind of technically should be sucking on it and letting it melt in your mouth but I'm impatient it's actually a really good holy [ __ ] for being a vegan chocolate bar Wow I know I'm not really a big sweets person I'm not really a big chocolate person either but this tastes really good I mean it you can taste the slight cannabis taste in the background but overall this is like wow really surprised really good job what does the company euphoria extractions really really good job definitely a really good tasting chocolate bar so alright guys so without further ado I'm gonna finish this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour an hour and a half and give you guys the effects and how I'm feeling so enjoy the rest of the video guys peace [Music] so so far so good I mean I'll give you a little bit of information so I got the Edible from a local dispensary here in Toronto and it was about I think $26 for that chocolate bar kind of pricey I mean you have to pay taxes and whatnot which is whatever I mean you got to do what you got to do right the government has to get a cut always so yeah two hundred and fifty milligrams bar $26 I mean the chocolate bar itself tasted amazing tasted like a regular like dark chocolate bar really good taste you could taste the cannabis like on the back end and yeah that's all I can really say is if right now really good experience so far and like I said I'll come back in an hour now in half and let you guys know how I'm feeling so hopefully you guys have been enjoying this video I know it's a little bit different than what I normally post but I know there are edible users out there I know people might want to see these types of videos so I said why not make this video right oh yeah like I said I will see you guys soon and enjoy the rest of the video peace guys hey what up guys I'm back and we're gonna talk about the effects and how I'm feeling after taking that edible that I was talking about earlier so it's been about an hour an hour and a half no I don't even know I haven't even checked the time but I know it's for sure it's been an hour so I'm feeling pretty much the full effects already and holy [ __ ] it is definitely some phone stuff it's just a typical indica high I mean you're just couch locked you're sedated your pain with a lot of pain relieving properties a lot of body effects relaxation no depression no anxiety and yeah you're just having munchies you feel tired you could definitely fall asleep no problem but it is definitely some pown stuff and it will definitely last a long time so that is also a plus if you're looking for long lasting effects for like medical patients as well so yeah I mean that's basically all I can really say about it it isn't edible it's not like it really has like a taste or like you know any other smells and stuff like that it's basically just a chocolate bar so my overall rating I guess for this edible out of five I would definitely say it's a high quality edible I would give it a solid four to five and definitely recommend it if you live in Toronto and you're looking for edibles like that's definitely a good company to go with I would say so yeah that's been an edible review by I'm always blazing the 250 milligram euphoria extractions vegan chocolate bar so I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did drop a like comment

another orange but they're kind of different shades so maybe they're different types of like orange flavoring then right here you got two green you got a blue raspberry I'm assuming got a fruit punch what else you got another fruit punch blue raspberry and another orange man I think the orange one is their best one so I'm gonna go ahead and dump both of these boxes out on a plate and then I'm just gonna get to munch a man because these are a lot of gummies man these are gonna be 20 whole 10 milligrams per piece gummy so I don't even know if I'm ready for this boys hi guys so I ended up only just pouring out the tent the first thousand milligrams because I felt like 20 gummies is just way too much to eat in one sitting so I'm gonna do just a thousand milligrams this video but if you guys want us to get two thousand and three thousand milligrams at it we'll go ahead and run up the likes on this video and let the LED standard themselves know on Instagram that you guys want to see that challenge happen alright that way they could provide me with more goods so before anything though I want to show you guys this sick a shirt that they provided for me also it says standard the ultimate standard and it has it also on the sleeves I think I might have a coupon code for this so if you guys want to cop it I'm gonna go ahead and put it down in description below and yeah man let's get to eat here goes the first one I'm not too sure which flavor is which I must just assuming that the green one is sour apple because I have had the sour apple once before so I'm gonna go ahead and munch down on all of these men and I'm gonna give you guys the taste of every single one of them which I'm gonna tell you guys if they are if they taste like THC or anything like that some of Cheers [Music] now was this our Apple home for sure super fine like I remembered it and he doesn't it doesn't taste like like TC at all like I'm telling you it only has that little edible aftertaste that I feel like all edibles have so this one right here I'm assuming is the blue raspberry choose fire alright go ahead and I'm the watermelon I'm assuming you don't wanna do I'm a genius I I'm assuming this one orange is orange red up I can't tell can't tell if it's peach or orange one of those two so right here we go from the last one I might I'm thinking this one's pineapple definitely pineapple I'm assuming so those were five right chuni it doubled up on the all the flavors and we got here we got the last five so I'm gonna just go ahead and much down boys Cheers [Music] so all our chewing boys sorry if you guys to hear that [Music] who any water milligrams down the hatch that was not bad at all it's actually pretty enjoyable so I'm just waiting for these to kick in man and I'm gonna update you with you guys I'm updating you guys with what happens I mean I'm kind of scared the last time I took 700 700 milligrams of edibles I I blocked out almost so well we're gonna wait we're gonna see and I'll get back to you guys in a little bit mm-hmm all right ladies and gents so I just came to store real quick before they smell this um edible hits man holy [ __ ] it might be hitting as we speak but it's only been 30 or 40 minutes so I'm not - I don't think it really will I'm assuming it takes usually an hour and a half to two hours like it usually does so I came to the store real quick to grab some drinks and some snacks just in case I'm not able to drive later because a thousand milligrams is a dangerous amount all right so my eyes they are starting to get a little bit red I am starting to feel a little bit stomach pain I'm not gonna lie am i because I've only eaten one thing this morning it was just a little pancake so and it's already a 1:00 1:30 yeah so um I'm gonna go ahead and go in grab my [ __ ] drive back home and I'm hoping praying that it doesn't hit while I'm in the store because if it does I'm in a big I'm in some big trouble man I'm in some big trouble I'm not gonna be able to drive home definitely do not drive home under the influence man yeah and that that brings me to my next case only be watching my videos if you're 18 or 8 or 21 and over whatever it is in your legal state years already know that YouTube makes me say that stuff just for so they don't strike my channel and I get deleted you know so yeah guys I love you wish me luck and we're out

I make it I made a helmet so here we are a couple hours is like three hours later and honestly man it hit me you definitely hit me like right now I know all the times I haven't been this like smacked in a while I have been it's been definitely a lot of times as I've been this might them finally like just in my own thoughts right now and hmm luckily it's not like overpowering it's not like crazy like right in my head you know and it makes me it doesn't it doesn't really make me want to go sleep but if I do want to like just definitely definitely wanted to sit down and just relax man a little break down though those gummies definitely the hit in between I want to see I went half to two hours that was the time frame when I started really feeling like that like it started kicking mostly in the head I started feeling in the head at first and then definitely started feeling any more on the body once I got home I was just like oh my goodness and I started sweating a little bit more it's definitely just because I feel like I'm overthinking a lot of things and things but honestly yeah it's crazy and I definitely didn't know what what to expect going into this but yeah the crazy experience [Music] at this point I just kind of just want to sit down and just like really [Music] don't worry about anything but honestly the overall experience man is it really really freaking good like I honestly haven't enjoyed something this this like of this stature I thought honesty was going to be a different whole crazy different experience but honestly it's just like it's just the

runaround are you sending me are you coming now cuz I'm post on", "NCVBujyWvyE": "hi my name is coupons in this video is for mature audience so you better be mature if you're watching this today we are celebrating a thousand subscribers on YouTube that's right a thousand of you awesome people subscribe to my youtube channel thank you everybody who Tunes in and watches my videos and shares them and likes them in comments I really appreciate that holy [ __ ] so to celebrate a thousand subscribers I'm gonna stick to the theme of a thousand and what I've got here is a 1-1 gram snake of some shadow I've stretched out here so we're gonna do a 1 gram damp of some of this grape star shatter if I can get it to focus I picked this up earlier from the hem Center really cool dispensary and this is about who cares what percent 66% but we've got a 1 gram dam which is a thousand milligrams of concentrate and then I also have a thousand milligrams of edibles that we're gonna take today so a 1 gram Babb and a thousand milligrams of edibles do you think that you can handle this what I've got here is the let's get it to focus I have the Colorado cannabis oil capsules and there's four capsules in here and there are a total of 350 milligrams through the whole bottle and they actually make these words four capsules and it's a thousand milligrams but I couldn't find that so these are just I guess less filled and the capsules but let me give you a breakdown we're looking at okay so each capsule is about 93 milligrams of THC and it is full spectrum or RSO so there are other cannabinoids and there's really good stuff I've had this many times before and it's actually my favorite edible so this whole bottle is 372 milligrams of THC and it's not like it's full there's only four little capsules in here and we're actually gonna take we're gonna take three of these which should be just over a thousand milligrams it'll actually be about 1100 milligrams so I'm excited and then I'm gonna try to stream on Twitch after this so this is for a thousand subs on YouTube but you know I stream every night on Twitch if you don't sub to my twitch channel like twitch that TV slash coupons check that [ __ ] out I'm probably live right now if you're watching this and I'm probably not on my thousand milligrams and one gram that but maybe we hit some milestones again I'll do it check out my twitch check out my other social media we have links in the description below follow my Instagram my Twitter sup to the subreddit check out the Facebook I don't know check out all that stuff join the discord that's the good one let's take some of the capsules first maybe like a half now and half after cuz like what if the dev just wrecks me I can I can't continue let's give it a go so this is 350 milligrams for four of these and they're just little capsules and I guess this is the same size for all of them so if you get the higher dose which ones they just they fill more but they have more of the liquid in it early oil so let's go for it let's take a nap now [Music] just little GHC capsules I kappapa movement in this or above okay so that's four of them I think and honestly guys I mentioned it before this is my absolute favorite edible I hate if I want to take a thousand milligrams I usually hate a thousand to get high if I want to take it it's like several brownies or like a fuckload of gummies you know what I mean I'm not trying to eat like a [ __ ] eight ounce bag of gummies to get a thousand milligrams I'd rather just like pop a few capsules and this is actually these are the low dose not like a pop four and get a thousand milligrams some of them are even more potent so I need to look out for those they're hard to find and they're kind of pricey well that's half of it down it's about 550 milligrams of THC here was 1100 for the capsules overall so we have half of that down and let's fire up the let's fire up the nail here we're gonna do this on quartz banger I got the pearls in there hopefully hoping I can get the time right I don't do a lot of dabs on this lately so I'm hoping I get the time right but if not I'm down for four reheats and whatnot we were just gonna milk this a one-gram dab is like it can be a million different things a hundred people could do a a 1 gram them and everybody consumes a different amount so there's different amounts of waste or whatever so I'm just gonna try to go pretty hot minimal waste but you know how it is let's let's see we got here [Music] we got a nice big old Glover here let's see how it looks [Music] oh that's thick [Music] not nearly enough holy [ __ ] [Music] take us amount of oil in there [Music] my eyes are watering [Music] oh it's so hot in here [Music] Oh [Music] Oh Mike covered in sweat now

control the the noise level from the pan and how our sweaty boy and I still have to take 500 more milligrams so I'm gonna stream after this good luck [Music] well at least a DAB was good I can do like a little sample of it or anything before once that was really harsh oh god that would have sucked it's really good it's got some [ __ ] shadow recently I did that over pride Oh try one more read on

marijuana [ __ ] symbol whatever else [ __ ] is um damn i have to get the whole thing and it has these little [ __ ] rose though just eat one room no you have to eat the whole thing i think the whole

taste them [Music] can i taste soup if you can't taste it dude i'm hella buying one after maybe you can't taste it okay well i can taste weed see because in this one you can smell it but it's not a lot i can smell it i can't taste it a lot oh yeah not really [Music] [Music] but there's six left i don't know it tastes like regular milk chocolate i couldn't taste the weird but not a lot so i guess that's a plus too i don't know if people like to taste it whoa that's because she's connected to the bluetooth um i got scared but all these noises coming out of nowhere but i don't know if it's a plus to not taste the weed or to taste the weed but i'm gonna eat the whole thing [ __ ] it dude honestly let's see if i get smacked what time is it what time is it 453 so we'll say [ __ ] five and

know what the [ __ ] i'm saying what was it saying oh anyways we were me and her we're talking about some [ __ ] and like it was like a little mini argument but it wasn't an argument it was like some on some funny [ __ ] and i was laughing and laughing dude and i couldn't tell if it was because it was just so funny to me or if it was because of the edibles it was not funny but it was hilarious um and i didn't even realize my eyes were this low it's at six o'clock now and so it's been an hour since i took them but i'm gonna just keep updating you guys more and more and see what's up with it um i'll pick it up like around 7 30 or i just feel like [ __ ] laughing now dude but we were just in a in target for a long ass time but yeah we'll pick it up later alright guys it's currently seven o'clock and it's a cool high it's a cool like edibles don't i never really had any smack but the ones i [ __ ] tried before and this is another one i'll add it to my [ __ ] list i'll give this one a [ __ ] 9.5 just because i [ __ ] with the high it's like a cool ass chill ass high you know it's not like that [ __ ] smack smack that i was [ __ ] thinking or expecting but it's like a cool last [ __ ] high you know i got the giggles out of it i got the laughs out of it um but yeah now we're just in the [ __ ] chill eat some pizza watch some tv and just [ __ ] chill i'll see what happens at eight um and yeah i'll just update you guys along but this shit's a [ __ ] vibe it's a cool ass edible the wonka bar it's a it's a golden ticket in itself man um but i'm just being pretty good all right guys it is 10 41. um i think i last picked up the camera like that seven or eight i think i don't know when was the last time i talked on camera but it's currently 10 41 man and i just did like a fat ass nap um i think i rated the [ __ ] edibles and eight just because i don't like chocolate but the [ __ ] were fired and i sure was a dope ass high i should smack man that should be this bad um [Music] in the beginning it's like a cool ass like brush you know you get to laugh you get the giggles you're just chilling you're vibing and then once you just like start settling down you just relax dude you know you just calm down you just i think a fat ass nap dude i just [ __ ] knocked out feel good now i feel relaxed i'm calm chilling um but that edible was [ __ ] fire not even a lot i should really did smack all right guys it is currently the next day and i just wanted to pick up the camera i was just showing you editing the video and i wanted to give you guys a little bit more i wanted to give you guys a little bit more insight on to how much the [ __ ] wonka bar is smacked now that i'm sober and clear now that i can talk to you guys right and [ __ ] clear minded but yesterday i did not smoke all i had weed wise was that wonka bar and i was [ __ ] vibing and satisfied that wonka bar satisfied me throughout the whole day i did not want to smoke nor did i need a smoke i was just gone the whole day um so just to give you guys a little run down throughout the day i took the [ __ ] edibles at five o'clock and after taking the edibles we went to the store and that was like an hour and 30 minutes in and by then i was already feeling something um but it wasn't like an uncomfortable feeling i was i was vibing i was laughing it up i was just laughing it up chopping it up honestly like i just was laughing at nothing and felt like laughing at nothing um and three hours into the edible that's when i was really really feeling it in my head and i was just like [ __ ] i'm so blown and you guys seen my face at 10 41 when i picked up the camera on the last clip i was ready for bed i was so gone um i was just so blown i was ready to knock the [ __ ] out and literally that's what i did after that after picking up the camera and i hadn't slept that comfortable in it in a minute let me just tell you that edible had me out like a [ __ ] light um but i slept like a baby last night and i don't know if this is just me but me personally i don't realize how high i actually was until the next morning i obviously recognized that i'm high in the moment but the next morning i woke like this morning there was this morning this morning i woke up and i was just [ __ ] gone dude i felt so groggy and lagged um but it was nothing bad you know um i love being relaxed me personally i'm a relaxed person so it was just a good feeling for me you know i was just calm i took a fire ass shower and i was just now i'm just vibing dude um but yeah i know i gave the edible a 9.5 but that's just used to give an understanding of how [ __ ] dink it is but that was just my opinion go try it out for yourself or if you guys have tried it out already let me know down below um but literally i was satisfied with that [ __ ] wonka bar throughout the day and i hadn't had any [ __ ] edibles smack that [ __ ] hard you know that's gonna the wonka bar is on top of my list and then it's the um stoner patch edibles that are second on my list um but i'm gonna just keep on um coming with [ __ ] reviews and a lot more videos i'ma just keep on grinding and working to get better and

school yeah high school i've been smoking weed so i recently stopped a little bit ago so it's definitely gonna hit the car like a train but we'll see what happens i don't really eat edibles ever so you've never eaten edibles i have before like once or twice but never like this amount we'll see how it goes you're down to do this oh hell yeah all right he's gonna eat the whole [ __ ] bag yeah you ready he's [ __ ] down that [ __ ] again it's gonna taste like ass no it tastes pretty good i mean it's [ __ ] gummy worms let's see how it goes but um yeah so for those who don't know delta 8 is actually 66 percent the psychoactivity of delta 9 but i mean 500 milligrams you know oh man he's just down and look at that how's it taste [Music] yeah so these are the sour gummy worms so you just downed it we're probably gonna check back in in an hour it's gonna take two hours to kick in but we'll check in every single hour to see where he's at you're gonna he's gonna be drunk yeah i know he's gonna get screwed up dude he's gotta wait 40 minutes yeah no he's gonna get [ __ ] up it's 500 milligrams dude fun fun dude i mean we'll see what happens i don't get that [ __ ] up normally one hit of a bomb and i'll be [ __ ] fried you're gonna be [ __ ] up i'm hoping i'm like paralyzed that's what i'm hoping for so yeah [Music] those taste like real gummy worms though that [ __ ] well no they are real gummies yeah but normally like if you infuse like a cookie with thc and you can still see guy should be [ __ ] up it will be worth it though dude perhaps you're doing that i mean it's not like it's not like you know i mean you don't have to work tomorrow right he's underplaying it dude yeah i'm unemployed baby you're good you're good 25 minutes how do you feel better cousins not bad not bad i don't think it's i feel like it's not hitting yet all right we'll check back in it's a placebo effect right now i his eyes are getting kind of red man i'm baked let's make that right here let's go to the light a bit so these uh people can see how red the eyes are um so guys um i shouldn't say guys i don't like that hey you look at those eyes right there that's what those edibles do after one hour that's 500 milligrams of delta 8 thc um edibles man they're frying me already hell yeah it's been what are you expecting in the next 30 minutes sleeping probably so we'll see if we get any more of this are they sativa indica or what just distilling distillate oh so [ __ ] blacks is that what that is i guess you could call it delta 8 wax i mean wax is desolate um i guess but there's different methods of extracting it like co2 and bho and i guess the consistency determines what you call it but it's just distal it's just super thick and sticky and uh basically the gummies just regular gummies and they actually spray it with the actual thc oil oh wow so you're when you eat the gummies you're literally eating the straight oil on the actual gum that's insane i don't think i heard like a word you said because i'm just [ __ ] just going in and out of my eyes oh okay [Laughter] you feel [ __ ] up oh [ __ ] i can't feel my lips oh no like stuck to my teeth so wait you what do they feel

you get too high you can smoke some cbd and calm yourself down you can get an eighth for free by the way so uh yeah i hope you enjoyed the video hit that like hit the like", "87FgbwgR34E": "hey guys welcome back to the do gross on today's episode I'm gonna show you how to make edible chocolates I'm gonna do pretty much from the start to the finish starting out with infusing butter and enough with a really simple way to do chocolates we're not making it from scratch we're just infusing like baker's chocolate with our and fused butter [Music] well for this batch butter I decided I wanted to go with green crack which is a hybrid strain but it's it leans a lot more towards a sativa side so it kind of wanted a good daytime high-energy kind of butter to make these chocolates with [Music] so I did want to make this butter fairly strong fairly potent and I had two cups of butter and which is basically four sticks of butter and I infused a quarter ounce of this group of cracked flour into the butter with the magical butter machine the first thing that we have to deal with our cannabis is 2d carbon so throw it near oven at 250 ish degrees and spread it out a little bit and make sure it's in there for about 31 well that does is it transfers the THC a and to THC psychoactive property in cannabis so you definitely need to do that before infusing it in the oil little tip if you guys are using this magical butter machine is while your d carbon erat cannabis just throw your like hard butter right into the magical butter machine right now and start it up for an hour on low temperature just so you can melt your butter and then it's ready for the D carb wheat as soon as it comes out [Music] well after 30 minutes in the oven I pulled out all that weed and took it off the stem no need to put the stems in there and ended up having 12 grams of cannabis that went into four I'm sorry two cups of butter all you need to do is just add that right into your butter solution that you have all warmed up and add a little bit of soy or sunflower less at it as well that helps to emulsify and combine the cannabinoids to the butter I love this magical butter machine though it does it all for you adjust 162 hours once everything's in there you are good to go to set it and forget it for two hours [Music] all right so let's talk about dosing that is a thing that's really hard to find exactly the right the right metrics on how to get it I found this website this calculator out there and you need to know the starting material the THC in the starting material I know the screen crack is roughly 20% so that's what I'm starting with and if you're using trim you might not really know what you're getting so this one I wanted to get a more accurate test on on the exact THC percentage per serving [Music] I was gonna be melting down 12 ounces of chocolate and I was gonna add two ounces of the infused butter so I knew that for the 12 ounces of chocolate I was gonna have roughly 210 milligrams of THC that's going to get infused in that entire batch I didn't know the final amount of serving still after I poured it and that's how many the runner and the first one so the first set of chocolates so I do that that was roughly 5 milligrams per chocolate in the first batch all right so after two hours next step is we just have to classify the butter away from all the cannabis material that's left in the bag so there's this bag comes with the magical butter machine which is basically just like a strainer so pour it all in there squeeze it all out get all the butter through hopefully you don't get too many solids that come through with it there definitely want some milk fats that came through but was able to pretty much clarify that out by just pouring it into the jar before I was gonna add that to the chocolates you do lose some starting material as well so even though I went in with two cups of butter I only came out with about maybe a confident corner of of the butter I probably could have done a little bit better like squeezing out more but that was the clearest stuff that I got and that was the stuff I was happiest with so yeah only about 1 and 1/4 cup but off of the two cups of butter I started out just by doing a small double boiler thing you can warm up chocolate however you feel like this I just boiled some water put another pan on top of it in the water and poured in the chocolate chips from there so 12 ounces of chocolate chips and 2 ounces of the infused oil [Music] after that just start for a few minutes want to make sure it's obviously very evenly infinim mixed in they might want to separate a little bit I actually did add a tablespoon of some more lesson to this as well to help with the emulsification of the oil and the chocolate [Music] the first bachelor did two ounces and wanted to see how the consistency was they seemed really good when it popped amount so the second one I was like maybe we can make these a little stronger so I added three ounces to the next batch which ended up being on the dark chocolate chocolate chips that who meld up here [Music] now all that's left to do is just pour them into your molds I use these silicone molds I got off of Amazon I didn't need to oil them at all they pop out super easy so yeah just forms for an ear molds and then right under your freezer only takes about 30 minutes for them to firm up once you have your final count about how many servings you have then you can actually see how many milligrams of your THC is in each serving so my first batch I kind of overfilled a little bit all the way up to the top and I got like 40 for individual chocolates of this semi-sweet stuff with the two ounces of infused oil which was roughly 5 milligrams per serving my second batch the dark chocolate I used 3 ounces of oil actually a little bit more than that and it ended up making 62 I want to say 62 servings so a lot more servings and that's visit and pour in the chocolate quite as much but the THC percentage was roughly the same because I used that more THC infused oil in the whole batch you I have all sorts of different containers and stuff for flour and inedible so I put some of these little ten summons bags and then I'm gonna be leave them in my refrigerator for I don't know maybe a week or so eating them once in a while but also just want to let them dry out a little bit there a little bit moist so yeah leave it in the fridge for a bit and I think they'll be good on the shelf for at least a couple months and that is it I think that is the easiest way that you can make chocolate edibles they're not making any chocolate you're just melting down existing chocolate adding your oil boom done simple as that so it's gonna work for a lot of us that aren't expert cooks like myself and yeah I think these things will be great so check out the magical butter machine if you're interested at all in making infused oils you won't regret it I'm going to post a link down below that you can click as well to get it off Amazon and if you've watched a couple of these videos that though if you subscribed and hung around got more videos coming up about once a week

I don't know when I'm editing it and crazy party dress party just like I was checking out comments comment coming up Concord comment gonna make comments comment ok CC b9 Clare [Music] [Music]", "hhTPYdjGxP0": "oh my god you guys all wanna be in my video hey guys welcome back to another video if you're new here I am Judith and today I do have an audience hello yeah but anyways today I am going to be eating or trying to eat a 500 milligram edible that I did find at a lab that I recently went to it was the first time that I had gone there and I just had to pick these up for you guys because I've never seen them ever in my life and once I figured out that these existed I saw a video on YouTube and there was comments saying that they really didn't hear so I'm not sure if I should eat the whole thing or eat a hundred milligrams of it because the other time if you guys haven't seen my if you guys haven't seen my last video I did eat a moon edible 100 milligrams and that edible like totally hit you guys I Loki freaked out so yeah I know that 100 milligrams will do me justice when it comes to properly hitting me right but yeah I had to pick this up for you guys 500 milligrams you guys enough to make me feel like I'm dying I'm not even kidding but I don't think I am gonna eat the whole thing or the whole string but I am gonna offer some people some of the edible its if you want it you want it and if you don't then you don't know pressure let me go ahead and set this camera up for you guys I am going to open and eat this in front of you guys you guys already know the deal so yeah if you guys haven't checked out my last edible video go ahead and check that out and let's do this okay I am literally on my knees for you guys but let's do this okay so this is the edible again you guys look at this cute new packaging I've never seen this type of edible ever I just had to pick it up for you guys I have to I have to this one unfortunately is not really like childproof it does have that starting cut there so it can easily be open unlike the other edibles I've said that it's a great idea not to suggest an opening just because young adults and kids can be around as for me I do have a baby around so you know not good for that but other than that it is cute I love it yeah they're medicated nerds 500 milligrams that's just tripping me out like I don't really believe it but I don't know I mean it just say it on the packaging so it says total dosage is 500 milligrams of THC and the rope has eight servings so let's see I don't know I mean that's you so it's saying one-eighth of the rope is 50 milligrams so we can calculate that by cutting it in half and then cutting it in half again and then cutting it in half again so that's pretty much a small ass piece like literally this is 50 milligrams and then another 50 and like it's just I don't know it's pretty crazy to me it just say that it's 60 minute activation time right there so I guess it's gonna take about an hour just like the other edible that I did consume for you guys so it does have this California warning sign that everyone always looks for on packaging but yeah I mean I wouldn't honestly you guys I wouldn't really trust this because I did buy it and an underground type of lab I've never even heard of this lab I was invited I wasn't even gonna buy anything so these are kind of like products that I'm iffy about so I don't know I guess you have to do your research I didn't do much research but I did see a video online yeah that was it that was pretty much it if you guys do want to have more research on this go ahead and look up videos because I'm pretty sure these are getting more known out there but yeah enough talking I'm just super talking talking maybe because I'm so nervous I don't know but let me go get some scissors actually no it has the tear there um and then let's do this so let me do a quick thumbnail and then we'll get back to it it is so hot in here you guys I'm really trying to just do this so let's do it okay yeah ready or not here we go so it says teryn share which I do plan on doing I am going as my uncle probably if he wants to try some hey baby baby okay I'm doing a video let's do it so I'm gonna open it sorry my babies in the background you guys okay look at this you guys what the heck so I had this in the refrigerator and my mom was just like freaking out telling everyone this is not a candy that this is marijuana and Dada Dada and I mean yeah precautions you guys so I'm gonna have 1/8 of the rope okay so 1/8 of the rope that's what it looks like you guys and it does say on the packaging it is 15 milligrams so here goes nothing not a soul bomb maybe you wanna try some it's so bomb you guys this is dangerous oh my gosh you guys okay two eights of the rope so this is gonna be a total of 100 milligrams why is that so bhama if you guys hear little parts as my sister's baby they just want to be cheese massage they want to be here and watch me the film for you guys these are so so bomb he says that it has a super potent formula okay I think I should keep it like that cuz I don't want to freak out you guys but okay I'll have a little more so I can have half of it which is gonna be 250 here's another one so it should be about 250 milligrams if not maybe a little less a little more nice learn can't film here you guys it is so hot in here mom like I ate a little less or a little more of 250 milligrams you guys I'm gonna feel like I'm dying but I'm yeah let me go see if anybody else wants to have a little piece of it maybe just 50 milligrams or a little more I don't mind sharing this it's whatever I did post this on snap so if you do follow me on snap you know that I did post this and I asked you guys if you guys have ever tried these and some of you guys said that they smack which is why I'm kind of scared because I don't want them to smack me so hard but some of you guys said that they don't so I guess it's just our personal experience and yeah I hope that they don't super smack but if they do a Plus let's go see who else wants to try some of these so we are gonna go outside and I am so hot here because I closed all the windows and doors so that no noise could come in but yeah your girls ready to go outside and just breathe but I will be checking up when this [ __ ] starts to hit and let you guys know what I feel so yeah let's go outside [Music] do you want to chase up it's a 500 milligram nerd okay you guys my uncle is down so go ahead and open it and then 1/8 of the rope is gonna be 50 milligrams so right there it does okay getting eighth you know what anything I know how an ape looks and we know candy no a little more a little more this would be good in them yeah I mean if there's a 500 milligram rope come with me yeah cheers Cheers you have to let us know how you feel okay I am back and I am definitely feeling this edible more of like a body high I feel yeah like maybe more of a body higher than anything else I'm like slowly freaking out like I can just feel it creeping up right now we are watching a movie so yeah I can definitely feel it while I'm watching the movie and yeah I'm pretty good right now but you guys I can definitely feel it just like it's gonna hit me like I know it's gonna hit me super hard and I just I hope that I don't freak out but yeah this is an update this is probably almost an hour after I ate the edible so keep in mind I ate about 250 milligrams this is about an hour later which yeah like the packaging said that it would hit me 16 minutes later and it's about that and I can definitely feel it creeping up right now so yeah this isn't even this isn't even the full-blown like faded moment but I will be back for that I hope that I am not freaking out or anything but yeah my mom is making carnitas and I just cut onion and cilantro and yeah I helped her in the kitchen and I'm gonna show you guys what we're eating because it just looks so bomb you guys that goes everyday bomb like super bomb and they make the best that Anita's so shout out to them but anyways let me get back to you guys and then if anything when I start to really feel it I will also ask how my uncle is feeling because he did take about 50 milligrams so he isn't really gonna feel as much but he'll definitely be feeling something if this rope is potent like it's saying it is but yeah I'll be back I already ate a taco and it was so so bomb but this is what they look like ooh ooh they look so bomb the airplane the baby I totally forgot to record I am still a little faded I honestly thought I was gonna hit harder but it didn't the day is still going the days are going so I'll be back to let you guys know the update so I thought the Edible was going to hit a little harder after the last video that I did make but no incident I was probably peaking right there and it didn't go any further than that but um yeah I was expecting it to hit a little harder just because I did consume a 250 milligrams and it just wasn't that heart of a high or a faded moment but yeah I mean would I buy them again I probably wouldn't maybe for the flavor and the taste because it tastes so bomb but for it to like actually hit and make me feel super faded mmm I don't know I'm gonna have to think about that one but yeah it was pretty good I enjoyed it I still have a little bit left and yeah I'm pretty sure it did hit my feel not as much but yeah he's knocked out after a while I thought it was gonna hit a little harder but it didn't so that's kind of a shame because other edibles that I have tried they've hit pretty hard so yeah when I buy this again sorry I'm in the kitchen and everyone's eating and I just decided the wrong time let you guys know the update but yeah it didn't hit that hard would I buy it again maybe not maybe for the flavor and taste but for it to hit me hard no I'll probably do a moon because with a moon edible eye it got me so good with just one hundred milligrams I did check up on my uncle he is totally asleep so yeah I guess I'm gonna ask him later how he felt after the edible but yeah it was a good run I did enjoy the edible it was really fun eating it I was pretty excited and yeah I've never seen an edible like that and I'm glad that I tried it for you guys like a rating out of 10 probably like I don't know a 7 just because it peaked and then that was it like I didn't really feel like super faded or anything maybe I was more of a body high but yeah other than that it was good I hope they get like the video I'm gonna show you guys a bit of what my sister is making and then that's the end of the video or maybe I'll include a little more because we are gonna drink later so other than that thank you guys

clear and the reason that I was able to do this and to an extent handle it I mean I passed the [ __ ] out but to an extent handle it is because I smoke and have smoked a lot of marijuana and done a lot of different things with THC in my life and large quantities so you know I I'm kind of I don't know for some reason edibles just never really get me like that you know like I can't just eat a you know bag of edibles and just get high it doesn't work for some reason with me and I I mean it used to but as I you know kind of progressed and started smoking more and more you know and this happened fairly recently and you know as I started smoking more and more and just getting older and becoming more of like a veteran smoker if you if you could say I guess you know edibles just stopped having an effect on me for some reason it was mainly just dabs and bud that would get me I which I'm ok with and you know it still is that way but you know either way I decided you know can I I wanted to test if I could really get higher or not off edibles like truly baked like how I used to get off the edibles you know I was curious because the past couple times before this that I'd eaten edibles I didn't really get very high at all I had to combine it with you know a couple blunts or something to really get where I wanted to be so you know I had a couple bags I had three bags in total of these edibles that were I think they were I know they were medical they were like actually professionally made not like some homemade brownies or anything they were these little uh these gummies and they were called like terrible's I think I think I've made a video about these before but it was a different story but these edibles were the same edibles in that video so you guys remember that shout-out to you that's an old video I think but either way these things have 400 milligrams a bag so I figured you know my original plan was I'm just gonna eat two bags and then I was like well I kind of just want to get to the 1000 because that's a cool number you know and like I'd been sitting on these bags for a little while I was originally planning to sell a couple of them but I figured [ __ ] it I might as well not you know I kind of like these like they not only you know did they have THC in them and quite a lot but they were actually pretty tasty like there were some good edibles and I've had some edibles that did not taste too good but these are pretty flames you can't really tell that there's Whedon them like if I just put these in a bag I don't think you could tell they're edibles by eating them until you get high as [ __ ] but either way you know I decided I'm gonna eat like two and a half bags and go for that 1000 so off I went you know I looked at the back the dosage was like there was like 20 pieces in each bag so I was like alright I got to eat 50 of these [ __ ] so I literally poured out two bags onto a plate and then I like pulled out ten little like gummy things out of the other bag and I was just like alright I'm digging in so yeah I went pretty ham on it you know I I was on an empty stomach I hadn't eaten and you know I found up and probably a solid like fifteen ten minutes even you know I mean I really I went for it man I went for it man I'll tell you right now and you know at first I didn't really know what to expect you know I this was by far the most I'd ever eaten in terms of edibles and I wasn't really sure what to expect because I figured in my head like that can't be that like insane you know like I'm probably gonna be kind of stone but I don't think I'm gonna be super [ __ ] up but edibles are very different than just smoking a ton of weed edibles you know they're there in my eyes a silent killer they sneak up on you and just [ __ ] you they just do your dirt and let me tell you I was sitting on my couch and I was playing some games I had my Nintendo switch hooked up to the TV it was Boston and let me tell you I was playing tomorrow cart and it just happened man you know I was I got done with a couple races and I didn't really like notice when it hit me but it was very quick you know I got up to grab something to drink and I felt like how do I describe it I felt like those like balloon people out front of the car dealerships those like Wiggly like inflatable tube guys with the flailing arms you know the the family guy like skit they did on that I felt like one of those dudes I felt very very noodley I felt very wobbly and I was I was you know I wasn't really a fan of it but either way I made it up the stairs grab something to drink went back downstairs and just slammed into the couch just absolutely collapsed into the couch I was never so happy to sit back down ever in my life and have an ice-cold water it was so happy it was just a truly a cherished moment a moment of pure euphoria if you will but either way you know I sat back down and I was loving this [ __ ] let me tell ya I was just skirting on Mario Kart playing like [ __ ] I don't think I want any races I played like probably five or six races in a row and I think I came in no higher than fifth in any of them but nevertheless I sure as hell was having fun because let me tell you guys if you if you have a switch you know but if you don't have a switch playing online on Mario Kart is scary because the Japanese guys are really good like the [ __ ] Japanese guys are so good like they don't play but either way you know back on topic so I'm just getting smoked by the Japs dude it's like [ __ ] Pearl Harbor all over again it's terrible and you know I'm eventually I tap out you know I go to play some other games I end up playing some Xenoblade gas game super vague I love the switch by the way this is not sponsored but the switch is a great console it's so convenient so convenient but either way you know I'm chilling and you know I I don't really like I'm not doing anything that takes too much thought so I'm not really like realizing how high I am but eventually as playing games maybe like an hour and a half into it and I hop on my computer you know where I always am the bool spot and you know I'm just playing some games on discord with some people and I'm just something very loud just bangs outside of my house am I getting robbed all right well if I get robbed that would be kind of late for the commentary but either way back on topic hopefully not um you know I was on discord with some buddies playing some games and I I realized as I was playing with them that like nothing I was saying was really coherent whatsoever like I was like I mean I was I was able to talk and conversate but like I was just talking like an idiot pretty slowly and everything I said was just dumb you know like I I just I knew inside that I was just being an idiot but I just couldn't control myself if that makes sense you know I was just being a [ __ ] and I couldn't handle it but either way yeah I was like all right you know I have to plan maybe like two or three games to counter-strike I was like all right I'm going to bed [ __ ] this like I got to lay down or something you know I was slumped because as I was progressing through these games you know counter-strike games are long I played like 2 or 3 games and they're probably like 30 minutes a game you know 30 to 40 so long games so you know after like two and a half hours into my high I was slumped you know and it wasn't like this SuperDuper baked like whoa man kind of thing it was just like the entire thing was very very passive it was like I just I was just chilling you know like that's honestly the best way to put it you know it was a really nice body high you know very noodley just [ __ ] didn't feel like I had any bones you know I just kind of felt like a I don't know dude what doesn't have bones do frogs have bones frogs have bones but not very strong one so I'm gonna say I felt like a frog and it was just some wild [ __ ] it was a fun time but either way hope you guys did enjoy this video a little short story today also on the second channel the smoking slash gaming channel the videos on there are more you know I put a lot more effort into the production of them you know it's a lot more editing a lot more work so it's gonna take longer to get uploads on that channel so please do be understanding impatient with that but yeah

story time before i go into the next bite this was actually i think three years ago on new year's eve um this was my first time ever trying an edible and it was the first time my parents ever caught me off the edible so i had 150 milligram um corova brownie pretty much the same size as this but it was 150 instead of a thousand and i [ __ ] blacked out for like at least three hours i woke up and it was like two o'clock new year's day um my homie was like oh your parents are calling you gotta go home and i was just across the street i go home and all my all the neighbors are outside they all see that i'm bonked and i like i'm almost falling over as i'm walking home so it was terrible um and my parents grounded me and that was the first time they figured out oh my god my kid's a stoner but now now they're out shopping and they're gonna come back and they're gonna just enjoy this oh his brain tastes gross this much two more bites you guys i'm not gonna lie the taste of this alone is so disgusting i [ __ ] hate brownie edibles so much the final bite that bite right there goes out to chris because he said if you don't eat the whole thing you're a [ __ ] i'm gonna agree with you i'm

still chilling i hope you guys enjoyed the video subscribe like bye [Music]", "VojGDszvdQk": "hello senior stoner fan just the real senior stoner back at you for a comparison of opiates vicodin to edibles and during the comparison discussion what i'm going to do is give you a peek behind the curtain if you will on how senior stoner manages his pain with less of these more of these which means edibles versus opiates here we go first of all i have to say that what's happened is i've been able to take my opiate use down from fentanyl patches 75 milligrams to one vicodin a day three time four times a day and sometimes i don't have to do that and the reason i've been able to do that isn't because they've solved my spinal condition isn't because i've been able to be operated on they've all refused isn't because i've been able to have the spinal stimulator oh well your pain changed mr senior stoner it's not going to work now carry on well i didn't take it sitting down this was all happening during pandemic and you had to wonder how was he able to survive you survived with the love of mrs senior stoner and you survive with the love of your family and the love of sugar and you all but you survive by finding a formula to conquer the pain and make you in control of the pain as much as possible you can't do it with all these because with all these you'll stop going to the bathroom you'll yell at your family and friends you'll have other complications you know what i'm talking about those of you who use these okay so how do we take these and use less of these i'm gonna take four vicodin for vicodin and put them on the table here in front of you all why okay there's four of that baggie there that's a day for senior stoner instead of 75 milligram fentanyl patches by the way did i tell you it was in addition to 20 milligrams of the lord of the day which is morphine essentially now down to uh you to some people this is very strong but i'm down to four vicodin a day how how is that possible unless if i really try if i grip my teeth or if i'm using alternative methods and that's the key here what is the alternative method what i have found isn't something i cook anymore okay it's a way of looking at it a way of measuring it a way of using the edible a little bit here and a little bit there instead of bang like that okay no sledgehammer you don't want a sledgehammer that's the first thing you need to understand you want a graduated effect you want to be happy dude and lady you want to be happy we all do you want to be out of pain but how do you get out of pain we can't get out pain got to get happy how to get happy you got to find something that makes you sing find something that makes you go find something that makes you move okay a lot of times unfortunately unfortunately because doctors have a lot of things it's not going to be these four pills they operate in the background it's like an aspirin what i've done is i've found nirvana two things blackout brownie and animal crackers you're gonna go what is he talking about well it's a thousand milligram blackout brownie and a package of seven pieces of 50 milligrams each animal crackers they're by the cookie factory i'm sorry i can't tell you where to get them how to get them i'm sorry a fairy drops them off here i'm sorry you know in the air a stork whatever but what i want to talk about is how i use them okay put any of your edibles that you can get in your hands here's how i use them forget the brand 350 which is five seven piece units seven five seven fifty milligram units one one thousand milligram brownie well i've tried eating the whole thousand milligram brownie and i almost didn't wake up it was unbelievable i got the shakes the shivers you know what it was crazy so what you need to do very simply a company called corova used to include a grid on how to cut it because what you have to do with this brownie if you have to take it out and score it you're going to say what do i mean by score well this already comes 7 50 milligram pieces so you can take it as you need it i take one or two a day depending okay but my primary edible is the blackout brownie and how i do it is the following way for you guys simply you're gonna measure it take a tape measure and it's gonna measure roughly three inches square three inches by three inches so what am i gonna do i'm gonna make tic-tac-toe out of it essentially what you're gonna do is you're going to cut it into 10 equal pieces you're going to say why why because you want to take it with you let's say i'm going to put away my pills why because you might want to take it with you number one why because that way it's pre-measured okay and it's easy that way you put it back in there and you have the pieces well that's really the textbook way to do it i'm gonna tell you guys again under the hood i'm giving you a picture a look behind the curtain i don't do it that way okay i take it as i need it and sometimes i'm off that's not good which means sometimes i haven't had enough and sometimes i've had too much there's a sweet spot it's like with a tennis racket or with a golf club you know what i mean when i say sweet spot so what you're going to want to do is you're going to simply want to cut this into the piece that makes sense for you everybody's going to have a different size piece they want okay i usually start with about 1 10 1 9 of the unit and i go from there so for example i'm going to cut a piece about this big you'll see i go on the corner and i cut careful with the crumbs this is very powerful stuff so you can't even leave crumbs around for children or pets i'm serious about this don't take a chance don't leave it around if you have a cat so here's where it comes out you're going to joke and say senior stone you're going to be kidding me that's about 1 12 1 12 1 10 yes it is okay because you can always add more with an edible one of the bad things about edibles is you can't go back and give it away oh i had too much sorry you got to wait it out so i recommend you start slow do not i repeat do not eat a whole thousand milligram brownie and think i'm a strong person it'll be fine don't do it so here it is right here all right the rest i put back in now an hour from now i'm going to reevaluate i'm going to say gee do i need more now part of the day today remember what i say before it's about being happy i said part of the day unfortunately with this storm i've been very stressed out which doesn't help pain but i would like to go watch tv and relax with sugar and sing for mrs stoner when she comes home so this particular brownie the blackout browning is as it says it is it is extremely strong wow i'm already feeling it believe it or not this is a little different feeling i'm almost gonna say it's sativa versus indica strong indica with a hallucinogenic element but the animal crackers are a nice enhancement animal crackers candy coated covered with the little sprinkles are really tasty excuse me for eating and the effect is going to be like a wave now you've put these two together so what i've learned to do and what i hope you all will learn to do with your edibles is take your time know what you're doing but know what you're doing you know what i'm saying it'd be a shame to have all this knowledge that we all have about edibles and then cut it in half and take 500 milligrams and think all's going to be cool because i'm going to a party it won't be cool all right somehow it's the way this brownie is engineered it's too strong layer in something like this which is a little bit of a pick-me-up it'll have a hybrid effect is what i would call it and now you've woven in two of the best things i can think of to keep yourself happy the whole discussion could have been framed would you rather be happy than in pain well do you have the secret way to do it you're looking at the stack of how to do it and i have the stack here and it's important you're looking at the stack for the right reason it's not because i want to show you my inventory you've seen that before you can see my you've seen my inventory not because i want to show you all the packages because i want to show you that i have a lot of them more than this and then i can control myself and that's the key you need to have self-control success with edibles success without a self-control equals success with edibles okay you know a doctor gives you a prescription the vicodin take one a day senior stoner uh four a day one four times a day okay or up two they gave you the prescription it's not on here in these packages it has ingredients it does not tell you how to take it it says seven servings per container on here probably because they wanted the package to be the same my point is that's 135 milligrams that's a lot for a person who hasn't had inevitable before for example so your individual use your individual judgments maintain your individual tolerances measure it out just like i showed you use a grid make your own template if you have to and remember it's very simple you want to use more of these and less of these this is the real senior stoner have a great day everybody if you thought this video was good please subscribe cheers", "BzQ9i6EeCZQ": "all right so boom this is the official Twain 20 guy on how to safely consume weed edibles or any year for that matter because this is time that's advice you know I'm saying so I find that consuming edibles I eating it it's a lot more natural and has a less health risks than smoking anything you smoke and inhale into your lungs as the potential to affect your breathing cars in such as bronchitis and just overall get lungs see lungs other basic necessity of life right but at the point to note that not all edibles are created equal and being knowledgeable of the dosage level that you take is crucial in order for you to actually enjoy and have a good experience rather than be one of those people on YouTube that gives a story time about their worst experience of marijuana [Music] three hours later welcome back to no song edutainment yall already know what's going on subscribe to channel cuz I'm a fun guy I'm a cool guy I go through my day pretty normal like I'm a normal guy I'm a swell guy I'm a nice enough guy I'm a cool kind of guy I'm a pretty groovy guy I call this honest entertain you make you laugh but most importantly educate you on a variety of subjects that make you learn something they can apply it to your own personal personal life so mister my research the general consensus I see for a serving one serving of an edible is about 10 milligrams but not all will be dispensaries created equal like I said before some of them serve a bit more some of them aren't as precise and having each in each serving wrap individually so depending on where you get it from one serving we have a bit more THC than you might expect usually if it does have more THC than the 10 milligrams like limit it should have this image or however you wherever you see this image on the box right there but in the meantime products with too much THC must have these warning labels so I've told you why edibles are better than smoking or vaping me but how and what do you do to actually enjoy it safe so I got about five different steps for you to follow if you listen to me if you listen to me just listen to me you will enjoy your edible experience simple because I know it all I just played so most places require or from what I've seen research most states and my keys most provinces in Canada require a limit of ten milligrams of THC in a serving of edible but my suggestion Prasad is to tone it down a bit more and actually do five milligrams as your basic reduction to an edible cookie gummy bears or whatever so number one is important to read the packaging carefully so that you don't overdose or not overdose you can't really overdose on wheat but you can definitely take too much this easy there go anybody take a tab hallucinate you finished our trip the trip but chill out I got a heartbeat I can't feel [ __ ] so no longer do you have to play Russian roulette with your dosage amounts there's now a legal dosage of ten milligrams as your basic level of attaboy experience but if it isn't made at home then in that case be extra careful with how much you're taking in a given set or given serving size so especially if you're new to cannabis or you don't take it regularly it's important to dip your toe in the water a little bit before you dive in headfirst rather than taking the recommended ten milligrams take instead to five milligrams and then wait another two to three hours before you take another serving size just so that you are easing yourself into the whole edible experience and you can actually enjoy the high rather than you know some of the other stories I've seen on YouTube and even if you are a veteran cannabis user you should also implement my foot dosing which is start with five milligrams or even you start with the ten milligrams wait two or three hours and then add another one why should you do this because it gently stimulates the body's cannon but receptors which results in an increased high or increased mood productivity creativity without the sudden high effect that you might get if you were to just like consumer all I was in fact Oh Oh cookies very important to me I mean I love to me but they mean much more to me Tommy so the high is a bit more noticeable noticeable and more enjoyable like is you're kind of like on a roller coaster type of thing rather than already being at the top right so you're gently taking yourself to that peak or a high rather than just as soon as you get to the rides everyday at the top which is not ideal so again five milligrams as your basic level especially if you're a beginner and then every two or three hours just gradually take another serving size just so that you can safely and enjoyably each edible our number two is important to consider your tolerance having a low THC tolerance makes you susceptible to negative side effects of taking too much weed or taking too much THC such as paranoia anxiety and dizziness definitely without a doubt it's better to have an underwhelming experience than an overwhelming experience where you are shaking your you panicking whatever it is it's better to be disappointed than to be on the other spectrum if I'm gonna say okay do what you want you an adult but take heed take heed all right one word is good enough for the wise so he was so it's your first time trying a screen or not well since you interacted with marijuana in general don't try and keep up with the veteran smoker so don't try keep up with the rest of the crew just go at your own pace because there's it's not a race I see alright I got this off like that got the sauce little ketchup those sauce little ketchup thank you keep up with them because people that consume meet regularly already need a higher dosage to get their desired high effect and this is why I say it's important to take weed tolerance breaks the tolerance breaks for weed are important because it allows you to get higher for a longer period of time so your high or not it won't be like twenty minutes it'd be like two plus hours or so and you can get high on a small amount of weed which results in savings yeah I put it all together see it and trying to save y'all money I'm looking out for you looking out for your pockets so take means haulin sprigs periodically so that you can continue to not need a higher dosage and that your high can also last for a longer period of time simple so number three it just be patient like I said be patient with the THC and how it how long it takes to affect you depending on your metabolism and your body fat it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two or maybe even a few hours so these snacks are not like your regular snacks at the grocery store or the corniche story these aren't regular snacks that you can - to eat as you're watching a Netflix videos or Netflix shows or movies whatever it is take heed to the serving size and be patient for 330 minutes any for 30 minutes to two hours if you feel the pips this is the moment you feel the effect is when you can like perhaps take another one but even at that let it right out for a bit on number four you want to be mindful of your stomach's contents so the more food you have in your system the longer it will take for weed to get metabolized in your bloodstream and take effect however in empty stomach I lost with the edibles to activate Kruger so just keep it just keep that in mind when and if you are eating edible did you eat already because if you didn't it'll take effect quicker and if you haven't eaten already before it then start with half a dose or what you usually take or what you want to take just so that you know just you can slow yourself in micro dosing same as the same thing micro dosing is the wave don't just jump in and if you drank alcohol beforehand alcohol can increase the THC blood concentration in your system so it's important to use caution if you're mixing alcohol with edibles and number five just this is more of like the nurture you know they say nature is the nature this is more of an immature type of thing it just be mindful of the environment like are you around people that you or as you care about you want people that care about you right and are you comfortable around these people so if you're taking a larger dose for the first time or long much more it's better take it at your home with your loved one or parent or francica with it your brother sibling romantic partner whatever it is just be around if you're taking a larger dose for the first time or just in general you are taking a new strain it's best to be around people that you actually are familiar with and you actually care about just to that part of for you to experience some type of anxiety or panic attack or just seeing a familiar face will keep you a bit more grounded if you did end up eating so much but again the more experience you have the more likely you are to be comfortable the easier it is for you to be comfortable in different situations or different environments but yeah so my kudos take it easy five milligrams or as your basis for anything for the most part and then just gradually increase your high once you start feeling the effects and its best it's always better to have an underwhelming experience then an overwhelming experience londo and take these five steps into consideration you will have a very enjoyable read hi and again have other videos above or edibles from marijuana lay the topics in the description pink ominous video and we showed with an addiction to read if you like you're smoking too much or you feel like it's no longer serving you I will hold mini course mini program that dancing walk you through

drop keys your friendly neighborhood Negro and today we're gonna talk about how to calculate edible dosage now recently I started a cooking with cannabis show called good eats on my channel where we make different meals infused with cannabis because of this I've been getting a lot of questions on how to calculate edible dosage so let's go ahead and get into this okay so in order to calculate your dosage you will need two bits of information you need to know the THC percentage of your cannabis and also you need to know how many grams of cannabis you'll be using to make your edibles for this tutorial let's pretend like we're going to make 2 cups of butter or four sticks I actually have some gorilla glue right now that's been tested at 17% THC so that's what we're going to use now normally when I make Kenna butter I use a quarter of flour per stick so for this tutorial we'll be using 28 grams or accounts of cannabis to make four sticks of butter like I normally do the first thing that you need to know is that there is a thousand milligrams in one gram of cannabis so the first thing that we need to do is we need to take our 28 grams that we'll be using and turn it into milligrams to do that we're going to take the 28 grams so we're going to multiply it by a thousand which is 28,000 the next thing we need to do is to multiply that by the amount of THC that's in our cannabis in decimal form so that means that our 17 percent THC cannabis is going to turn into 0.17 twenty-eight thousand times point one seven equals four thousand seven hundred and sixty so there's four thousand seven hundred and sixty milligrams of THC and this batch of butter that we're making right now but remember this is actually one of the four sticks of butter because we're doing two cups that means that we need to divide it by four that means that each stick of butter is actually one thousand one hundred and ninety milligrams of THC but let's go further let's say that we're going to make brownies and your brownie recipe calls for half a stick of butter that means there will be five hundred milligrams of THC inside of your brownie mix now if we take our recipe and make 10 brownies with our brownie mix that means each brownie will have fifty nine point five milligrams of THC inside each individual brother so that's it that's how you calculate edible dosage you have to find out how many milligrams of THC is actually in the whole batch and then break it down into how many portions you'll be making so I hope that this video helped you out if you have any questions please leave them in the comment section also let me know if you like this new style of videos that I'm doing I appreciate you watching much love as always peace [Music]", "tQvZcmtJXUg": "look at that you guys perfectly made 400 milligram chocolate bar recently i've really gotten into making my own edibles from concentrates i've gotten from the dispensary you guys have been asking me to make youtube videos about some of the recipes i've made so today i'm going to show you the easiest one i've learned so far today we're going to be making medicated chocolate bars it's extremely simple and that's why i wanted to show you this method first all you're going to need is a chocolate of your choice mct oil or coconut oil and either distillate or rso today i'm going to be using distillate but both will work the same for this recipe you can use any form of extract as long as it's been decarb some equipment you'll need is a heat safe bowl a pot a rubber spatula a pyrex measuring cup some measuring utensils a plastic syringe you can find these in most pharmacies and then you'll need a mold for the chocolates if you don't want to do bars you can do molds that look like anything you want there's stars there's bears you can really get creative now the amount of chocolate you use depends on how potent you want your chocolate bars to be the more chocolate you use the less potent your edible will be today i'm using a granite distillate that has about 830 milligrams of thc in it and i'm going to be making two chocolate bars so each chocolate bar is going to have about 400 milligrams of thc i'll explain how to calculate how potent your edibles are a little bit later on in the video but for now let's get started making our edibles first thing to do is fill your pyrex measuring cup with water and put it in the microwave for about two minutes after that two minutes is done take out your now hot water and drop your syringe of distillate in that water this is to make the distillate more of a liquidy consistency so it's easier to mix in with the chocolate you do not want to skip this step distillate is very thick if it's just been sitting in room temperature but now we're going to set up our double boiler by getting a pot with a little bit of water not too much you don't want the water to be above where the bottom of the bowl is going to be sitting on top of it bring that pot to a boil then turn it to low while topping it with your heat safe bowl the heat from the steam is going to be our heat source and now we're going to add just under a teaspoon of mct oil mct oil or coconut oil supposedly helps speed up the digestion process of an edible allowing you to feel the full effects quicker you let the mct oil sit for about a minute let it get nice and warm before you add your distillate and now we're going to take that distillate out of the water and pour it into the bowl just look how easy it is to squeeze out of the syringe it's going to mix perfectly now stir the distillate with the mct oil let it all get mixed together and now we're gonna add our chocolate i'm using just under two and a half ounces of milk chocolate here it melts easier if you break it up a little bit mix it while it's melting and make sure your stove is on the lowest possible temperature you do not want to burn the chocolate keep stirring until it's liquidy and now we're going to fill our syringe and transfer the chocolate into the molds you don't need the syringe but the syringe makes it a much cleaner process and since the chocolate is medicated i want to waste as little of it as possible so i feel like the syringe really helps with that this process takes a minute but the result is worth it i put a little cutting board under the mold to help them keep flat this especially helps when you're transferring them into the fridge and make sure the molds are filled completely nobody wants airy chocolate you can bag and shake the molds a little bit to help everything even out once the molds are filled you want to put them in the fridge for 30 minutes after that 30 minutes you want to transfer them to the freezer for about another hour and now it's time to enjoy got my molds fresh out of the freezer right here you guys gonna show you how good these look don't want to break it it's nice and frozen so typically they're not going to break on you oh yeah look at that you guys perfectly made 400 milligram chocolate bar bust out the second one oh yeah holy crap you guys that looks like a professional chocolate bar my plan is to cut these in half to their 200 milligram squares i feel like that's a little bit more of a realistic dose i've done this before and gotten a little bit more creative this is like a cookies and cream bar i used white chocolate and oreos since i used oreos i had to use a little bit less chocolate so i used about two ounces of chocolate to get two chocolate bars here's another one i've done where i added marshmallow and graham crackers to it so it's like a medicated s'mores bar all of these chocolate parts were made from the same strain with the same batch of distillate and the same amount so in theory each chocolate bar should have the same amount of potency and that's kind of what i was shooting for here i just wanted a bunch of different chocolate bars that i all knew were the same potency if you use two different types of distillate or rso and another one one might hit you a little bit harder than the other but since these were all made with the same amount the same strain from the same batch they should be a very consistent high and the reason why i like these little squares is i feel like it makes it easier to dose out a lower dose if a chocolate square like this has nine little chocolate squares in it and has 215 milligrams it should be somewhere between 20 to 23 milligrams per chocolate so i can either have like nine doses of 23 milligrams or an entire dose of about 200. it's super easy to find out how many milligrams of thc is in your edibles it just takes a little bit of math and a little bit of knowledge all you need to know is the amount of product you put in it and the total thc of that product if you're using a gram of distillate that has 80 thc it has 800 milligrams of thc in that gram if you're using 2 grams of distillate that has 80 thc there's 1600 milligrams in that batch so once you find the total thc in your batch just divide that number by the amount of treats you made so if you use 800 milligrams of thc in that batch and you got 20 candies each candy is going to be roughly 40 milligrams of thc this concentrate i was using had 83 percent thc in it so it has about 830 milligrams of thc in the gram personally i like to take a couple milligrams off my dose because i feel like not all of it makes it from the bowl into the edible so that's why i consider these bars 400 milligrams instead of i hope you learned something about edibles and i hope this maybe even inspired you to make your own it's super simple and all edible recipes are pretty easy if you can bake or cook you can probably make edibles and let me know if you guys want to see more edible videos in the future and if so what kind of videos you want to see do you want me to make tutorials do you want me to just consume some edibles here and film my reaction do you want me to make super easy

subscribed which is very depressing so if you like what you see scroll down press the subscribe button and yeah enjoy the video hey guys what is going on today we're taking a look at another edible this time wonka bar edibles uh i had one of these over a year ago um but when i had it it was a bit fatter this way it was a bit wider and it was 500 milligrams instead of 300 and also they didn't have these um flavors it was just the milk chocolate but now there's a bunch of different flavors mostly based around cereal i think there's some like candy based flavors as well this is the captain crunch it says it's basically like a black market edible i don't think these are sold in any dispensaries that from what i've seen warning contains medical marijuana each chocolate bar contains 300 milligrams plus 300 milligram milligrams plus of cannabinoids i got your nutrition facts right there three grams of protein wow um 220 calories serving size one bar i don't know how some people can just eat edibles like that but i they [ __ ] kill me like i i cannot handle edibles very well anyway if we bust this bad boy open i i swear i'm pretty sure the one way back actually had wonka like on the chocolate but i guess i could be wrong because i don't remember it that well but i'm a big fan of this chocolate to be honest um very potent i would say as well for for for a uh black market not extremely legit edible they're very reliable and consistent for what they are so i would definitely recommend them but i would also be very careful unless you are experienced with edibles i guess unless you eat a ton at a time and know where you know what your limits are if you have any limits i know some people that can just eat tons and tons and tons of these things and i feel nothing my dog's complaining in the background what bud i'm making a review one second anyways in conclusion if you're looking uh for you're not trying to spend a crazy amount of money if you're if you're in the realm of uh black market edible then i would definitely recommend these if you're okay with that pretty cheap only about 25 bucks a bar if you're just buying one 25 30 dollars definitely worth it this captain crunch flavor pretty good and i'm not the biggest captain crunch fan so i'm sure the other flavors um are even better so thank you guys for watching i got a bunch of videos like this if you

is overheated my regular camera is overheated so I'm on my second camera and I am showing you guys I'm not even gonna smoke during this video but we're gonna do a little story time cuz I'm already stoned as you guys can probably already tell my throat hurts from the dads [Music] okay I just I mean like legitimately I've recorded three videos to that they were all stony this one is stony in its own little way because this is gonna be a little story in my live stream last Friday somebody asked me have I ever had a bad experience on edibles and you know what it took me a second I was like no no I haven't absolutely not all of my experiences on cannabis have been great like I don't have any really bad story tons I mean I've smoked a sativa once and it gave me some anxiety and maybe I freaked out a little bit but like no big deal nothing big but then I remembered then I remembered when I first moved to California and I remember it wasn't my first trip to the dispensary that this happened but the second trip to my dispensary that I thought I was a badass [ __ ] at that point I thought you know what whatever the highest edible is give it to meet us what I want like give me the strongest I'm a tank I need the strongest I had only been an illegal medical marijuana state for height [Music] a week at that point two weeks so I really was not used to the weed here because I don't think that it's necessarily stronger but there's definitely more access to like I always had in a lot of it like talking on that second trip to the dispensary I told them give me the strongest edible you have I'm a tank I can do this keep in mind I was not a tank at that time I had just moved to California and had been smoking weed illegally in Mississippi for like a few years but that's it like I was not a tank at that point I was not an everyday smoker like it was totally different ballgame so back then California did not have the regulations that they do on edibles now which it's probably for this reason but like I hate it because like now I would love to have the stronger edibles but like now there's a cap on edibles in California that you cannot get edibles over 100 milligrams or you're not supposed to sell them or that I still see a few on the market up to 300 milligrams and I don't know why cuz they're not supposed to be on the market but they are back in the glory days of California edibles you could just put whatever you want in it I think up to a thousand milligrams because that's what I ended up with I ended up with a 1000 milligram brownie I was not Burson edibles at all had no tolerance edibles and I feel like there's a totally different tolerance to edibles and there are two like smoking like it's just different it's just way different like you have to get used to edibles like they're it's a totally different high it's a totally different way of ingesting them the tolerance is totally different but I thought I could totally take it now this 1,000 milligram brownie was supposed to be ten doses that's what it said on the package but it's a regular Brown you guys like it was like this big so obviously I ate that [ __ ] I the whole thing with a nice glass of milk honestly couldn't taste the wheat in it at all tasted straight like chocolate amazing like and I'm like cool this is great when it hits my stomach like I'm noticing that like my stomach is like gurgling as I eat it but like I'm gonna ignore that because I'm like oh it's probably just the cannabis in there I'm probably about to get super [ __ ] up so I just continued to eat the bar ate the whole damn brownie not barn brownie and uh sit and wait and I mean like I don't feel anything at this point like nothing thirty minutes goes by I don't feel anything forty minutes goes by I don't feel anything an hour and twenty minutes goes by and I swear you guys I don't feel anything except for that my stomach was cramping so badly and yeah just like I just kept getting like super bad stomach pains but that was like it nothing nothing psychoactive nothing cold so I go and I eat another 150 milligrams chaplet bar because I'm like nothing's happen so I eat that and I smoke a joint because at this point I'm just tired of waiting I'm like man is this - come on finally the high starts to creep up on me like and it's weird because I'm not at my normal place honestly I've only been an absent in California for like two weeks at that point I was staying at my brother's apartment he wasn't home from work yet and so I was there in his apartment it was the trickiest experience ever he lives on like a low ground level so like the sidewalk was at his windows so you can see people walking by and you can hear them and select I just keep hearing voices and I'm getting so [ __ ] paranoid because I'm like where are these voices coming from and like the room starts to suddenly like shift like shifts it's not actually shifting obviously but like visually the room is like doing this and I'm like what the [ __ ] is going on like I had never had like any type of like a really cool experience on weed edibles before like I bet a super stone but like nothing like this and never have I ever had an experience like this again on lead edibles that I also have never ever had 1150 milligrams of edibles all in one sitting within like two hours because that's like not normal pace yourself so like okay so the room is shifting and I'm like bah like what is going on like and I'm like like it's not fun like it sounds like they're like people talking above me and I can't figure it out because this is not my apartment I don't really understand it's like we're like right there at the sidewalk so I'm just like hearing these voices of like people talking there's this homeless man apparently that was outside and he was like babbling stop and so it was like this really weird babbling noise but like they just sounded so creepy to me and it was like freaking me out so I'm sitting on the couch and I'm like the room is shifting I'm hearing these weird noises like it is not a good time this is a bad trip you guys bad triple or who's like get abort mission like CBD stat what's going on obviously I didn't know anything about CBD or anything like that or you know pacing yourself or milligrams per serving x' or anything like that before this but you know learn as you go right so I look at my phone cuz I'm like [ __ ] my brother is gonna be home from work soon and I'm I do not want him to see me this [ __ ] up like he knows that I smoke like we didn't have conversation about like me going getting a 1150 milligram edible and I've worked the next day this is a new job by the way like why was I like experimenting with like massive doses of edibles during the workweek but yeah but I didn't tell anything the next day spoiler alert and got worked on everything was fine dandy but let's go back to that night so my brother is like gonna be home in like an hour and I'm like look what I do so my reaction okay so he lives in a high-rise building and he lives obviously on the basement floor like I've already told you guys my reaction is to grab a blanket because it's cold it is October at this point or no no it's like November no it's November at McTeer November November so it's November at this point so it is probably cold but I grab a blanket wear it like a cape and then receive to run up all 12 flights of stairs in his building until I get to the rooftop and then I sit on the rooftop up there and I'm like okay we're just gonna let this hi we're off here you know like because I don't want to be in his apartment and I don't know why I thought go to the roof this is probably like not a good source probably like how like bad things happen when we don't just like you know my thought was to go to the roof and like I bet spoiler alert I'm a lot nothing happened but I hate not a good idea probably but I went to the room which his roof was you know secure there's obviously fencing around it so you're not able to just fall over the edge and there was like tabled seating and lights and little trees and stuff and so like there's no one up there which thank the Lord there was nobody up there because I probably looked like a crazy person with my like blanket wrapped around me like a cape running up the stairs i Superman trying to get out of that apartment as fast as possible even though he wasn't even gonna be home for an hour like I was already going upstairs so I sit at a table and I'm like we're just gonna wait this high out like I'm just gonna wait this out like and then I'll be able to just go downstairs and it'll be like where were you and I can just delay oh I was out or I worked late or something like that I don't know I could come up with something Charlotte so I'm sitting up there and then then the strangest [ __ ] thing happens in my entire life like this is what like really freaked me out okay so then like there's like this like block of [ __ ] birds that come to the roof and I swear they just sit around me like I'm like so [ __ ] freaked out at this point you guys like like I'm like what is going on like what voodoo [ __ ] is happening to me right now like this isn't good like where's the holy water like what the [ __ ] it's not like they were blackbirds or anything like that but there were birds that just like descended upon where I was and then surrounded me in a circle and were staring at me and like at this one I've already keep in mind was downstairs hearing voices like my first like few days of staying in his apartment I mean really pay attention and like so I'm already in this weird head space of like this is a weird trip like this is trippy this isn't even real so then I start to yell at I go back I'm like just trying to get the firts to go away that was like my I thought like Oh make noise and then we'll all go away and they didn't they just stared there they were just and so I'm like what like like freeing the [ __ ] outside throw my blanket down and then like obviously like a bunch of them fly away and like I couldn't like just gotten up and walked it around because it's not like they descended me in like a circle but like I was sitting on a bench near wall and they like legitimately we're like covering like half the wat like like they surround it half the side of the table but like I had the back end and I could have just ran away but I decided I needed to scare the birds away before I went so throw the blanket blanket is now on the rooftop and I am like freaked out about the rooftop so then I go back downstairs and there's the lobby and I'm like okay wait this out Bobby and I don't know why I'm like so freaked out about my brother finding me like this because I'm not even like that thought - I mean like I guess I am because I'm like tripping you know but like I'm like I should have just like sat and waited this out of my brother's apartment but I why so I'm sitting in the lobby and then there's a dog that comes in and the dog isn't friendly and I'm like freaking the [ __ ] out because like I'm a dog person I don't encounter dogs that don't like me I was a dog walker I walk dogs through the app wag which is basically like the uber of like dog walking I did that like prior to working for the law firm that I worked for actually no I did it after I quit the law firm in between doing this profile in dog walking yeah but anyways I'm just like not used to dogs like not liking me and this song was like scariest [ __ ] it looked like huge like huge like not a bulldog but like big like a mastiff like big dog and it's like lunging towards me and I'm like sitting in a chair in the lobby minding my own business and this dog is like legitimately like I'm here dogs here and it's like like like so scary like I can feel its spit coming towards me like that type of scary like it's like hey it's just the woman hasn't all inhalation slain I'm so sorry and she pulls it back and then she sit outside and lets it use the restroom it seems like it's just a normal dog out there and there's another dog out there and another person he doesn't act that way towards that person I don't know if it's maybe just men or something like that some dogs are that way towards different people like you know dogs are weird like that but this dog was like lunging at me so I'm like my anxiety is through the roof you guys like I got like three or four different weird-ass trippy things happen that should not happen when you're like tripping out like and I am just like so scared but I'm like I'm gonna stay in this lobby but I'm scared that this woman's gonna come back with this dog and this dog is gonna [ __ ] attack me so I stay in the lobby until the woman with the dog comes and the woman with the dog comes and then I decide then I'm just gonna walk up the 12 lights of stairs like slowly and then hopefully that'll like give me time to walk the rest of this off and my brother will be home so I'm like walking up the 12 life two stairs I walk back down the 12 lights of stairs like super slowly probably creepily like just walking the halls with no destination but I was like it'll take me a while to walk twelve flights go all the way up plus I'll get to see the building this will be neat so I'm walking up the 12 flights of stairs I walk back down the 12 lights of stairs and then I realize something his doors locked somehow the door locked when I left or I locked the door but I don't have no keys I don't even have my phone I just left it down there so I just sit and wait at his apartment and eventually he comes and then I just tell him that I was locked out like I locked myself out accidentally left for a second and just left the keys in there to pick something up that I ordered in locked myself out and he never knew the difference and the night was totally normal I've slept through the night it was a weird night like I had some weird dreams that night like really vivid dreams I can't remember what they were about now but I do remember waking up and being like whoa like that's like reality like this is weird like waking up and it feeling like something just happened you know what I mean but like that's how it felt and uh yeah I went to work that day everything was normal no hangover or anything but yeah that one thousand milligrams was really weird it made me super paranoid and it just made me view things like in a very like like like I don't know intense way like everything seemed very life-or-death and very intense and just like I don't know but yeah that's my 1000 milligram brownie story plus 150 milligrams chocolate bar so 1000 I got 950 milligrams of THC plus a joy it's not a good idea you guys pace yourself you don't need to do that much it's not fun it wasn't a fun experience I never had we'd make me feel paranoid before but that made me feel like parent no life so yeah if you liked this video give it a thumbs up leave a comment below let me know if you've ever had a bad edible experience or bad like hi type of experience let me know how that way let me know if you have any funny stories

know have no permanent damage done thank you guys so much for watching and subscribe to my channel because I do three new witty videos every single week thank you guys for watching and I'll see you guys around bye you", "3XrKXtWPQW4": "you guys they turned out amazing look how beautiful they are mmmmmm like smooth it's so much just like melting your novel it's amazing hey guys welcome back today I'm gonna be showing you how to replicate and infuse my favorite chocolate bar from Purdy's I don't know if there's a party's in the States but in Canada we have lots of them and they have really good chocolate and they make this amazing chocolate bar that's white chocolate with sprinkles and pop rocks and is so good it is like the best ever only difference is that ours is going to be infused with coconut oil here's what you're going to need white chocolate sprinkles pop rocks and the most important ingredient coconut oil so this is the mold I'm gonna use for my chocolate bars and I'm not sure how much chocolate I'm going to need to melt so I'm just gonna have put my little chocolate wafers in here to kind of like visualize approximately how many I'll need so I think that looks about good I might need a little bit more a little bit less so we'll find out but I just don't want to melt too many if I don't need to since this is the only mold I have for a little chocolate cute little chocolate bars so I'm just gonna put the chocolate into my Pyrex measuring cup but a bowl or anything is fine I'm just shooting to use the pirate so that I can pour it out after so I'm gonna put this in the microwave for about 45 seconds so 45 seconds is third melting a bit ruin and stir it we don't want to over melt the chocolate or it will get like chunky so you just have to melt it slowly and then stir it melt a little bit more so I'm gonna put it back in for 20 seconds that was 20 more seconds and it is perfectly melted now and then we're going to add in two tablespoons of our coconut oil so my coconut oil is just that partly room-temperature partly melted it would be best if I had this sitting on the thread shows fully melted that way I could put it into the the chocolate a little bit easier and measure it out but I just scooped it I was fine too now I shouldn't have to microwave this again because the heat from the chocolate should melt the quill but I might not do it we'll find out just keep stirring it a bit to just warm it up and melt it so I think it keeps me melted a little bit more so I'm gonna put it back in the microwave for like ten seconds and I do want to make some of my chocolate bars Oreo so I'm gonna have like a mix so I'm just gonna bring up some Oreos and add them to some of the moulds okay there is our ten seconds and you can still see little coconut chunks but I'm just kind of stirring them in and pressing my spoon against them to melt them there's still a little bit of Trump so I'm just let this sit here and melt a bit more while I put my Oreos into my bowls just gonna break them up and put them right into the mold I think that I don't know like should I do them with Oreos and sprinkles like these ones over here all gonna be the sprinkle and pop rock ones but these two I want to be Oreo but it just like should I also have sprinkles I don't know okay we'll save that to add on top okay so that those little chunks have melted a bit you can mix that in and I feel like we're probably gonna need a little more chocolate like that doesn't look like enough for all these but before I add in my sprinkles and my pop rocks I'm just gonna fill up the Oreo ones now maybe a little bit more Oreo on top I'll crush these ones a little bit finer those look good it's like cookies and cream I wish I would have crush the other ones this small kind of looks a little bit better mmm it smells like cookies and cream okay now for the other ones that I'm gonna do top rocks and sprinkles I could mix it directly in here and then pour it in but I kind of want to pour it in and then add it so we'll see how this goes I think I'm gonna have to make more anyway and obviously you can use any fillings you want like you could add any sort of like cookies you could add mint flavoring you could do like marshmallows oh you can do anything you want okay I do need a melt a little more this will just be like a mini one maybe just like those like Hershey bars you get a Halloween okay now I'm gonna add the pop rocks cotton candy how good is that gonna be with this is anybody else is just like love cotton candy flavored things like what do you have flavor is cotton candy I just feel like it's sweet flavor okay it's open these up let's see what color they are okay so they're pink I would have liked it they weren't pink to be honest because like I really want to see them but they might blend damn with the sprinkles so we should probably be fine today I'm just gonna kind of like mix them in like how much do we want it there you'll see a man sprinkles now sprinkles are the best part I like lots of Franco I like the crunch of them in there and we're just gonna mix them in again my god this looks so good so I filled up my molds with chocolate and put my toppings in them and then I'm just gonna put them in the fridge for like I don't know 20 minutes 30 minutes we'll find out how long it takes alright guys they've been in the fridge for about half an hour and they are ready to come out so we're just going to pop them on out of their molds but we're gonna do it gently so we don't break the chocolate while it's coming up guys they turned out amazing look how beautiful they are okay the best part tasting them ah mm-hmm-hmm oh we have the extra sprinkles hmm yes oh these are so good they're almost better than the one from Perry which is weird cause like I use pretty cheap chocolate but I'm thinking the coconut oil being added like smooth it so much just like melt in your mouth is amazing thank you guys so much for watching please leave a comment give us a thumbs up and subscribe and I hope you have a wonderful day [Music]", "wKefGrIaUhQ": "you know here at truebloods TV we love the edibles so today we are making our own cannabis infused chocolate bars using some semi-sweet chocolate and some cannabis infuse coconut oil to see exactly how I made this check out one of my recent videos I'll post a link in the description but the cool part about today is Russell at cannabis candy molds shoutout him sent me these chocolate bars along with my favorite part these cool ass molds and look professional they look like molds or chocolates you would get at a dispensary also came with some foils some bags to wrap them up in who wouldn't love that as a present and a cool stamp so you could put that on anything to keep it out of reach and keep things safe what you need here is a double boiler or you can do what I'm doing iced have a pot here I'm gonna use a pyrex dish I was gonna buy a Dutch oven but I'm like I don't have one so I want to show you you can make it work with what you got I'm going to turn this on to a low medium low heat set that baby in there and let's start out with the semi-sweet chocolate I'll pop the camera in so you can see a little better you don't want it too hot you want to make sure you do this at a slow low temp as you can see it's starting to melt it's probably about two tablespoons there that's a lot that's probably over a half cup that supplies half cup three quarters so I just added half of the other chocolate bar to give it a little more texture because it's looking a little liquidy give it a little stir now we're gonna go ahead and just dump it in the mold so there we have it we have the foam molds about 1/2 cup of the coconut oil with a bar and a half of the chocolate we're gonna let it set in a refrigerator for about 30 minutes to an hour all right so it's about an hour later and they are hardened let's go ahead a little put beautiful beautiful might have been able to wait an extra few minutes but hey I wanted to try one no let's try one tastes good nice coconut oil flavor chocolate animus taste isn't overwhelming thank you again Russell at cannabis candy molds for the amazing molds chocolate the goody bags foil and the molds worked perfectly [Music]", "L8qPkOobNoQ": "jacked up extreme chocolate bar one thousand milligrams of thc and it's a white chocolate and peanut butter oh my god someone's been eating my chocolate bar [Music] that tasty that's really tasty sorry to say that it tastes like like grandma's um grandma's peanut butter fudge i thought it was grandma's panties [Music] choc cup chocolate bar extreme or is it extreme chocolate bar 1000 milligrams of thc white chocolate and peanut butter smoke you out", "HtaG8WmgrFk": "three amazing items left hopefully on the dish the dankness here colors pedro sweet sativa hawaii heartbreak pre roll and this shall we WOWY chocolate ten and ten so let's shuffle it that's pretty good shuffle there we go come on disc a dankness give me something good to eat look at that I got it that's pretty good I guess it's chocolate time chowie Wow eat chocolates it's legal edibles here we got this shall we Wow a milk chocolate coming in at a meager ten milligrams of THC but also ten milligrams of CBD so I never get into the CBD I never found any good use for it or anything anyways I thought I would get this just check it out with something a little different because those bang ones I had they were ten so this is a 10 with also 10 of this so we'll see if it actually does anything I have no idea so I'm just reading the back here it's got some little instructions here says the balanced chocolates are made with 10 10 and 10 each piece can be split into two squares to enjoy with friends what yeah right fucking a bunch of people all sitting around on a 10 milligram fucking chocolate bar are you kidding me we recommend starting with just one square but then waiting to feel the effects before having more while you wait you could invent backstories for Street strangers anyway I don't understand what that thing is talking about that's all crazy but it says start with one square and there's two squares or yeah two squares well you know what fuck that I'm gonna start with two bars because fuck that here we go open it up here Nano somebody my tolerance is just way too high so I figure two bars should give me an idea see there's one kind of neat actually not melted which is nice in Alberta right now they had to recall chocolates or something because they're all melting and I can't sell them at the moment which although I guess that would encourage you to make your own and while making their own you'll probably make them way stronger and for way less money so you probably are gonna hurt them so there we go two of these shall we Wow he's you know what should we take a look with a microscope here we go up close on the chocolate with the microscope [Music] that's neat you can see like the grooves you can check them out the grooves where the letters are see that it's getting super close-up on that look at that I'm getting a top-down view right on top pretty cool huh it's going close still cool I guess it's still cool I don't know these things look ok let's break it open OOP looks cool looks like chocolate so yeah I guess I'm gonna have to eat these fucking things and we'll see how it goes okay well here's number one holy that one mm-hmm not bad [Music] hmm nice tasting chocolate very nice tasting chocolate they mean a cool thing no not really though so this will be neat to tell because I do have a pretty high tolerance I make my own cannabis oil all the time and I have it every night I've had it every night for like three months so my tolerance is up there so this would be a good indicator how this stuff is for people with a high tolerance I would say high edible tolerance not high smoking or vaping tolerance but high edible tolerance so I'll be cool [Music] anyways I'll be back need is too of course but I'll be back I'll let you know how this is I'll come back in like 45 minutes or something do like the other ones there I'll check back in in a little bit so it's been 50 minutes and say these things and I do feel a little something but it's so light they almost don't know if it's even anything it's like it's like if you're sitting here and you think you hear a knock at the door so you go over in your check and then you open the door like you look around there's nobody there so you come back and sit down and 20 min 20 minutes later you're like did I just hear a knock at the door and you run over you look again nope nothing there nobody's here so that's what it's like so far for these fucking things and you know how much these cost there were seven dollars and 20 cents each so this is like $15 what it seems like now is like fifteen dollars thrown in the garbage because this stuff is absolutely pathetic fucking shit but I will give it another 45 minutes I'll be back so I'm back here with the spend another hour so I have two hours after I've eaten these fucking things ten milligrams THC 10 milligrams CBD these are seven dollars and 20 cents each so this here is like $15 I pretty much just threw right in the fucking garbage so this stuff here is absolutely pathetic is severely underpowered severely overpriced I'll rarely say this but do not buy legal edibles they're not worth it they're fucking garbage you can make your own stuff way more you can make way more potent stuff for way less using stuff that you buy off OCS I do it myself like I'll put a link here's a link right here check out that that's how I make my oil my cannabis oil and it's way better so much better than this garbage and the funny part is I make it out of my garbage like I make it a vape scraps not even you know it cost me nothing to make it really so what the fuck is the point of these things I have no idea I don't think I'm gonna buy any more legal edibles maybe I'll try the candies the gummies I haven't tried those yet but anyways that's it for now two things left on the disk of dankness you like checking those out and I hit the subscribe button and the the Bell there it'll tell you when they come online but for now that's it for the whatever you call these things these cherry pieces of shit absolute garbage anyways see you later have a good one everybody", "INGue0fpEaA": "[Music] hey guys what's going on it's a girl I'm back cuz Queen and I'm here with another review a product review and today I'm doing one of my favorite things in the world I'm gonna review one of my favorite things in the world chocolate mmm chocolate and today's review is on Hayes and Maine and this is actually a milk chocolate and when I saw that it was one to one CBD and THC I was all over this of course as you can see it says 250 milligrams and then it has I think it says 34 percent cacao for milk chocolate that's pretty good and like I said one to one CBD THC and the 250 is 125 milligrams of CBD and 125 milligrams of THC so per piece per piece I'm going to get 12.5 CBD 12.5 THC which is you know 25 basically milligrams but the reason why I wanted to try this is because normally and I've said this before at this stage of my journey since I'm starting off I'm still a newbie I'm starting off pretty small as far as the amount of THC I try to consume I generally try to stay between 5 and 10 this is 12 but I'm hoping that because it's a 1 in 1 that the CBD will offset the high filling of the THC because this is more THC than I normally consume in in edible I'll just say that so and I should have haven't had we chocolate before so this is a new one for me like a chocolate bar cuz this is Arizona by the way my house is pretty cool but uh it was like a hundred and I don't know five today alright so that is what a serving size looks like and again I'm gonna tell you when it comes to edibles listen this chocolate board you're gonna want to eat the whole thing okay okay and what edibles one of the best ways to consume them I'm gonna get this out of my hands because they blow milk with edibles they tell you to hold it in your mouth and let it know I don't want to say just all but like what chocolate of course let it dissolve but like when you're doing oils and things like that hold it in your mouth awhile and kind of let it get into your system I'm really trying to you know it's good okay so I wouldn't to me is not there to try to compare it to something like the Hershey bar or something like that because I'm pretty sure it has a higher the cow example but I think it's very good I mean I think it's very good chocolate there is just a a back note like a under note of the cannabis but it's it's I mean it's it's almost not there it's very mild and maybe because I know that it has cannabis in it I'm picking up on that but I think if you just gave it to somebody and they were just eating it they wouldn't they wouldn't pick up on that but it's actually really very good and that's again I tell you guys that's the thing about edibles when they're very good like that you're you're more apt to pick up another piece because it's like you're not really even thinking about it you know is this unconscious thing to continue to you know don't want to consume something delicious something good and before you know it you're like you know 10 sheets to the wind and you're trying to remember why and so with this chocolate is very good yeah that's it's very good so I might if I feel any any differently or if someone notices me filling in you know a little bit like who I'll do a reaction video after this just to kind of let you know how about ten twelve point Bob didn't mean [Music] it's something that I would I mean I said this a lot edibles are not cheap that candy bar probably cost about 12 bucks for a candy bar yeah it's like normally you can go get a candy bar for a dollar you know 50 cents or whatever but we have to realize that this is also medicine and so you need to compare it to that and not compare it to something like a chocolate bar because at the end of the day when you're comparing it to actual medicine you know that it's a completely different story right so we have to be careful how we you know frame it but as medicine goes yeah that that went down pretty good so alright guys that's Hazen main milk chocolate and I like it I do alright guys I will talk to you later alright bye hey guys hey listen I just got through in a fish sandwich just everything's good but yeah they had me needing a snack yeah it was good very good chocolate and that was great for a while and I tell you again the edible is that I'm not I'm not going to talk too much right now you just have to be careful and I only have one square I don't understand how these people be putting back you know so much damn weed Oh anyway yeah [Music] you [Music]", "JCGKw4lkVgc": "okay any other deep questions you want to ask before we start this video it's already started welcome to Angel's anything show we have a very exciting video or here we're recording it guerilla style we have damned a man buying a camera now I want to show you guys what I have going here come I have weed whose disabilities I have this isn't sake I have weed graham crackers and foil I'll bring it back up to me if you know oh no you're not even oh here you go ready the final most important ingredient peanut butter if you know you know what am i making tonight folks I'm making the fire now back up a little bit basically what I'm making tonight is called the fire cracker now I have made this in college before we didn't call the fire cracker we just called it a way to take a small amount of lead and get as [ __ ] up as possible basically this is like the world's easiest quickest and most dangerous edible all you need is like a graham cracker peanut butter and weed and foil in an oven and you're gonna be able to make this edible and get so high you're gonna see ghosts I did this in college ones when I was really sick and I couldn't smoke weed and she said I was like I'll make this very very very powerful edible I ended up getting so high I called my sister crying she came to pick me up from college in a blizzard I had to take in completes in all of my classes because I couldn't finish the semester and I actually was almost dying I had pneumonia and like had to get on to steroids and [ __ ] but the point is this is not for [ __ ] children okay I haven't done it since then and I'm pretty sure Jackie did this once and she actually hallucinate it so here we go I'm gonna do it now dan one of these is just for you cuz I figured you'd want one they're very good like you don't know a good graham cracker these are good okay so the average dose is a gram but that's like if you want to like see ghosts so I do want to see ghosts I would like to see my father tonight I'm just getting ready but I got scared as I was doing this because I weighed out of Graham and I was like [ __ ] it and I turned a little bit out so it's probably closer to 0.7 so really all you do I'm hesitant to turn because my profile so just follow my hands okay all you're doing is taking these okay then you just slather slather slather the most important the most important part is to cover both crackers with peanut butter because you need the peanut butter and the weed to be touching on both sides because the fat in the peanut butter is what is gonna activate the THC in the oven so the THC the weed is like D carbon in the oven but it's d carving into the peanut butter bonding to the fat and bonding to your [ __ ] skull and that is why you get so [ __ ] up feel like I'm watching Bill Nye the Science Guy a weed girl okay sprinkle it sprinkle it now you can put as much weed as you want on here you know you can you can put Keefe on here is that enough do I need to have more feel like it's a lot you know I gotta be honest even the smell of this is bringing back memories that I don't want to have brought back and then I'm just gonna kind of do you have this do you have this so then I just go through and they need to kind of bond each side almost like you're cocking that your cockpit day in your life I'm not haven't cocked ringing up but I'm cocked mm-hmm and when you feel that you've sealed it and bonded it you just you know it's a peanut butter cracker but you don't want to send this off - can you record me it's not a [ __ ] interesting if you just record the phone the whole time am I in the shot these are like peanut butter crackers but you don't want to set them with little giant to school okay this ain't no lunchable now you want to pre-heat your oven to 325 degrees and once it's fully preheated you're gonna put this in for 25 to 30 I'm gonna do 25 because our oven runs kind of hot right and I'm gonna show you me eating it afterward so that you don't think I'm lying and then I'll show you the aftermath but yeah firecracker and it goes come on follow me the oven here we go wish me luck all right guys it's 25 minutes later and this baby is out of the oven and nice weed aroma is coming from it and now it's our moment of truth yeah so I just spent like five [ __ ] full minutes trying to focus the inside of this cracker but it's not focusing so all you need to know is that it looks like we've inside focus I don't know I'm sweating tits in this vest I can't explain the backstory in this video well alright no no eat this I'll let you know what happens who's ooh okay we're back so this edible what I forgot about this edible was that not only does it make you so [ __ ] high which yes it also makes you pretty nauseous left I forgot everybody very nauseous it's like a very well the ride of nausea but I was on the phone my friend getting so high and what he knew you know but it was good that I was talking to him because it forced me to breathe through the nausea and the highness and didn't know you're fine and otherwise I would apologize like passed out on the couch so I am very high I was way higher before and it was crazy I mean it definitely he it definitely launched me the Firecracker launched me into another to another place so I would say you definitely try it at home try it at home use lots of weaves if you want Okaloosa name alright thanks for watching some severe until sightings show see you next time bye hello we're back it's hours later I don't know if you can tell so you're about to fall off the bed", "FU08QFLnMkI": "[Music] what's up everybody my name is sarah b and welcome back to the haze today we're going to be doing another edible review we will be talking about los angeles's own la familia chocolate the mint flavor to be exact [Music] now la familia is a la based edible company that specializes in mexican style candies and drinks the packaging my goodness tell me how gorgeous this box it came in is now the first time i tried la familia was around three years ago and the packaging was very different i think they've done two rebranding since so it comes in this small box and i really like all the details on it the the name you can see on the side in the back here you'll get all their kind of like calories ingredients and all their disclaimers i love the little detail on this part on the bottom where it says there's no taste like home i love that so basically when you get the packaging you open it up bamboozled there will be a statement from the creator which i really like and then up here you'll get a little diagram of your candy bar and i'll show you how every little stick of the chocolate is 10 milligrams which is super cool now inside that packaging you will find this little bag and this bag contains your candy bar now again i love the color i love the whole theme but i do have some bones to pick with this part of the packaging because it doesn't work it doesn't work basically like this your candy bar goes across um right here it shows where you're supposed to put your fingers and your post a pinch and when you pinch the plastic as opposed to kind of flour open and you're supposed to be able to peel it back and grab your candy bar but since the candy bar is so big where you pinch the candy bar is still there so you can never get it tight enough to where this opens up i was trying for like 30 minutes trying to get it to where it would open and i was never successful at some point i just gave up and i took my scissors and cut it open so that's that's the problem so whoever is in charge of that maybe kind of rethink this i don't know something needs to change inside of that you will find your chocolate bar now i love that they have their name on it as well i thought that was super super cool and it does have a little wheat leaf on the side here so in case a parent finds this and it's like can i give this to my kid do not give this to your child now if you're someone who's into micro dosing or taking less at a time the size of this candy bar is a real benefit because if this is 10 milligrams then of course this will be five and then this will be 2.5 so there you go that's a really nice part of this product because it leaves it open for you to be able to dose yourself how much you need so let's talk about the flavor and the smell so if you're concerned about cannabis smell or taste you definitely don't get it at all on these edibles not one bit the mint flavor is very tasty very strong and it's mixed with a dark chocolate which i loved and it gives it a really familiar taste very similar to you would say like an andes mint or anything like that it's just a really tasty chocolate so if you like dark chocolate and you like mint the combination on these two is to die for you you won't be making a bad decision i'm telling you it's just a really great tasting chocolate you can't go wrong with it you can tell the quality when you try it as for the high the high is very heavy and i loved it i'm here for it the body high is strong i felt it was just a really great high i felt the body high is intense and so is the head high it is just a really great heavy edible if you're someone with a higher tolerance this is inedible than i would suggest if you're someone with a lower tolerance micro dose it as low as possible as you think around 5 to 2.5 and see how that feels for you for me this was great at about 40 milligrams i loved it i was i was chilling um another great thing about this high is that it's not extremely long uh it only lasted for me for about four hours and then i fell asleep which is great though because sometimes you're not looking for highs it'll last you your whole day sometimes you do just want to knock out wake up and have a brand new day which for me this was that now if you're someone who is going to be going to maybe a party and you're going to want to stay up and you're going to want to drive home at some point la familia chocolate is not for you but if you're someone who's going to be chilling at the house maybe hanging out with your family and looking for something that also can help with a sleep aid or some sort of body recovery some sort of muscle recovery this chocolate is absolutely great um i did get the heavy sleeps but that is something sometimes you want from an edible so for the overall experience i would definitely suggest la familia chocolates especially if you're someone like me who takes edibles quite a bit and likes a heavier edible this one is for you it is really tasty really nice the cannabis flavor is nowhere to be seen on it so yeah if you guys go out and you guys see a lot familiar i would say pick them up as for the price i've kind of seen the price range between 19 to 24 so i guess it just depends on what dispensary you go to and what they're selling it at so yeah try it out i loved it it's definitely something i'm going to be buying again and again and again so my name is sarah b thank you guys so much for watching the haze please leave a comment below let me know if you guys tried

we review number 10 today I'm doing something a little bit different we're going to do an edible review it is Incredibles indica Fruit Chews it's a hundred milligrams each one of these is ten milligrams and there's ten of them in there so each one of these right here is ten milligrams so I'm gonna go ahead and give those a try I'm gonna pause the video wait till I start feeling the effects and then I'll start the video back up again and we'll see where we go from there are these it's been about 20 minutes and yeah they're pretty effective you can feel it right off the bat I'm sure as time goes on as time progresses they get stronger and stronger but about 20-25 minutes in boom you can definitely feel that they're definitely there it's you know I mean it's definitely very very very effective no indica I don't know how you're going to feel the difference between indica and sativa when you're eating when you're eating edibles I don't know because it affects your body so much I don't know how you would be able to feel the difference between an indica and a sativa but these are in different shoes so yeah I don't know you know I'll be able to tell but um yeah these are pretty effective the price point for these ten of these gummies which equals a little over a hundred milligrams cost $17 they were on special for $17 I think they were normally like $19 or $18 so they weren't special for $70 I think it's well worth it for seventeen dollars you get blasted out in your brain basically 100 milligrams is pretty good thousand milligrams is insane so yeah we just keep

McNuggets right off the bat with something to make me think and honestly I looked at this meme and I was like yeah he's so right and it's what I know this is like a classic meme it's a it's a hot chick that's walking and it's a guy and his girlfriend and then the guy turns around and is checking out the hot chick and so the hot chick is small amounts of weed the guy is the police and the girlfriend is actual crimes so the guys ignoring actual crimes to go to I pay all sorts of attention to small amounts of weed which you can buy at a store which doesn't hurt anybody which is really good medicine but let's let's go bust balls on it since they might not be paying a proper tax on it you know I will take you on in the news Scotty's got a new story revolving around this discussion a little bit yeah a little bit man thanks frosty good stuff and no grambo posted this over egg I stole this off of his Facebook but grandma posted he goes this is awesome he's like this is what my

there and lots of good stuff over there and Thank You Vlad II buddy I still like your memes sir let me tell you what a medicating medicating with today is Panama man what's up super lemonade Canadian DGC he's got some called Panama I've never tried it okay though until today on the show he said it's a super sativa man so we're gonna see how this rolls with the show and then in a next grow talk show I'll get into a little bit of his gross style and things that he's done as well as it's an awesome man I got you can see right in front of me here in front of my my computer in the studio the the these are just a few amount of the jars the friendly Canadian DDC as you can see rainbows on the on the end is the biggest with a zombie crush but man it's been awesome to be able to use a mailing system you know just imagine if you could do that there how much better it would be daddy I am jealous of that I've got to be completely honest I'm jealous there's all these new edibles I want to try there's all these CBD products I want to try make I can't you mail CBD in America I'm confused I thought you care yeah come on come on take it up with AG boy man FOH health CBD man you know how to do it yeah actually talking to a boy he's been a really good friend to me lately man so right on so what are you guys medicating with me you know I actually picked the sauce jaren left some of this sauce yesterday was he's got two strains he's been grown one is the wedding cake and then the other is the sauce and I can barely tell the difference between that when he just you know pulls out nugs well I say those are both dicks I know the sauces and I want to say the wedding cake is both the exotic genetics got it okay jaren is a big fan of exotic genetics I mean he doesn't write man that wedding cakes gray and this sauce tastes amazing landsem as long as I have Jen weed I'll be smoking it sauce from the concentrate boots flower oh it's delicious I just fit on this bins Clive resin pen that I got I mean make a yes yeah I was kind of jealous didn't leave one for me [ __ ] amazing man it's a live resin pen yeah it's it's and it really does taste yeah it's like cannabis turps is what it tastes like because it is cannabis chirps it's a distillate pen so it's distillate that's in there but then they reconstitute it with so they use distillate all from one strain and reconstitute it with the terpenes they separated from that strain so you if you have all that you get the entourage effects because all the terpenes that were pulled out are there again so it's kind of like the whole when they bleached flour and they bleep got all the nutrients out of it and then again yeah it's fortified but we put in but in the in the good weed way so yeah we were talking about that when Jordan was here we were talking about from Ben square talking about how you can smoke a whole shitload of dabs and it just doesn't get you the same high that smoking you know really solid joint will and that is that entourage effects as much as I don't like to be part of the hype man it's absolutely true just smoke flour and Deb's and you're good that's what the a lot of people do you know you'll smoke a couple of dabs and get a really high THC boost and and it just smoked a flower to get the to get the entourage effect got all right I got ass alright enough of it but yeah as much as I don't want to say it it's legit and you know you can smile I when I was in Florida I was smoking those dabs all day long out of that pen you know really powerful wax good quality wax and I didn't feel that high you know it was when I look back at pictures I was like holy [ __ ] your eyes are toasted they just didn't make me feel a thing when I came back smoke to join the first couple days with you guys doing the show I could really do the show it's a different time man nothing is like coal plant like token on flower is my favorite hide but I'm not saying I'm anti concentrate high but it's definitely different high you're not getting whole plant you know you're not so it is like that brown bag weren't you saying it though it's like drinking beer out of a brown bag when you're when you're when you're smoking out of your dad pen it's like you don't think that anybody knows but everybody [ __ ] knows hey I'm a big fan of the koozie Pepsi and a Bud Light right very similar when they're in koozies yeah but who the hell is gonna drink Bud Light yeah I wanna know what's up yeah he's gonna bring it up man about edibles man we were thinking about over on High Times they don't they launched and off anybody else's watched much over there but they launched like a TV like it can get available on your roku or they push the app out there trying to push the video content more maybe a tied in with some of the YouTube stuff and grow videos sure but I caught that video about the couple I think it's got like the high couple and they ate they mm man a thousand milligram animal and then somebody commented like thousand milligram brownie sign me up and I'm like how do you measure this do you guys know goo you got some minutes like how do you measure when you're making edibles I'm sure it's kind of hard at home like what color I just assume just go ahead and assume it's sixty percent THC by weight so if you have a gram that's of shatter that's point six grams of actual pure THC in there so you can get your dosage that way so you just guesstimating is what you're doing I mean without without having a shatter analyzed roof I mean if you got it from a dispensary or have a readout on it where it got tested you can go buy that but if without doing that just a good guess at shatter would be from fifty to sixty percent I'm not even talking to him just my homegirl harvested some flower and I'm gonna make some whip out the magical butter machine and make some coconut oil or butter it's at that point it's really hard as a home crafter to say oh these are 25 milligrams what just from Keith I guess I mean there's formulas for figuring it out from Keith to if you do if you dissolve all the kief into coconut oil I don't know probably 40% or 35% I would have said my weight from the Keith but I mean it's all without getting stuff tested it's just two guesstimation yeah we always we would go ahead dad's you know I'd give him to my dad or my friend's dad and see what happened we had to try on someone with a low tolerance yeah that's what I mean we never knew my buddy we travel with cookies when we use the road trip and stuff and be in prohibition land because it was safe and he'd have two types of cookies one was strong as these are the strong ones and one was not the strong one so it's like that's kind of with edibles when I make coconut oil I will you know you could take a teaspoon of coconut oil and just before you bake with it or would ever try that teaspoon right and then you don't see what it does to you for a couple of hours and be like okay that's not anger to engage the strength of your before you bake with it and that was a good way to know that these are gonna be this strong I can make them that strong but I think it's kind of hard as a home cook to get it dialed down depending on your resources and where you got your material two milligrams per piece yeah I mean I welcome the conversation but I think you got to kind of make a batch and it starts I like your test give it to somebody that's the best way you start slow though you know yeah definitely I do I would not want to get anybody on you know looking at those cats on that show after having 500 milligrams some people I guess can do 500 they're like whatever and I'm not against that but yeah I've had it happen edibles can creep and it's a different kind of high it's different as well my skin is now hei silence are you still not smoking much yourself I you know I started smoking again but I crazy adjourned yeah I couldn't help it he can't he rolled like three joints in an hour and they were awesome delicious I just had a smoke with them man but that might yeah but took me about two days is Saturday and Sunday the whole weekend I didn't smoke and and I felt a bunch better it's kind of funny cuz I think Kyle warehouse Kyle smoked over the weekend and he came into work a little bit of huffing and puffing Monday not feeling so good man so kind of felt good about taking the weekend off but I was just wondering about that and you know you hear all this stuff about about cigarettes being so bad for you it's the smoke that's bad for you right you know actually they cancel each other out I always love first this reminds me of like I'll see a guy sometimes get up to the top of a rigorous climb on a mountain bike in it take a break to have a smoke not common or you see back in the day the guy is doing the Tour de France like smoking cigarettes while they're racing and [ __ ] yeah but Jesus it's there's a health factor involved I think with cannabis I mean you're gonna you're doing more you're doing better to your body with your enjoyed can't cannabinoid system than harm I think that it would cancel out the potential effects I mean cigarette smoke tobacco smokes not even comparable to cannabis that's what I wanted to do a little bit of research and learn a little bit about am i doing the same thing to my lungs that I if I was smoking a couple cigarettes if I'm smoking a couple joints and what I found out was that you do put car into your lungs cannabis has tar so when you do an unfiltered loosely rolled cigarette a little joints you are putting tar into your lungs a lot less and it's a different type of tar and chemical makeup that your body can readily expel out of itself your cigarettes are has a lot of cancerous materials in it that marijuana do it's lacking and it sticks and stays in your lungs and coats them and I mean you can look at pictures of people who now on versus a non smoker versus smoker sure and pictures of their lungs from autopsy and their I mean you could look at and definitely see which one is the smoker yeah definitely and and the cannabis has these can we look at pictures and rastafari lungs yeah there's just pot leaves coating them sure that wasn't doing tons of because a man is coughing up a lung over the weekend man you know makes it makes you think what am i doing you know I got out the vaporizer over the weekend you know or when I when I started smoking again you know that that that's nice and easy on your lungs but but you also got to think cigarette smoke and tobacco just in general as an agricultural crop is one of the dirtiest filthiest pops ever and think about it this way so imidacloprid isn't neonicotinoid poison for the like most popular ones being used right now it is declining yeah it's a nicotine based pesticide they use lots of those on tobacco that you actually tobacco is one of the dirtiest it's just sprayed with pretty much the kitchen sink and in terms of the soil it's completely detrimental to the soil in three years it's stripped everything out of there and it's almost unform abble at that point geez so tobacco is just in general pretty bad and then when you know it's getting sprayed with all this [ __ ] that you're then smoking I know I'm most cannabis growers I know are pretty conscious about what they're spraying on their plants here I'm trying to just throw the kitchen sink at it sure I'm busy trying to researched our marijuana tar and lungs and it's like depends on who funded the study kind of thing just avoid the like Marlboro or Winston or Philip Morris [ __ ] oh here's image here's imagery of vapors lungs versus smokers once in the vapors long yeah just look like because clean is can be perfect in about like my conscience show I got one THC protects against lung cancer studies show that THC may offer the lungs protection from cancer-causing effects of smoke and this is dr. Tosh gene okay dr. Tashjian explained in a 2012 interview a time it says in the THC in marijuana has well-defined antitumoral effects that had been shown to inhibit the growth of a variety of cancers and animal models and tissue culture systems thus counteracting the potential tumor illogical effects hahaha Pro carcinogens and marijuana smoke I feel like I should smoke just for getting through that yeah this is leap science whose elite science yeah yeah by the way what this made in doing the research here made me understand that you can't trust anybody like I'm like do I trust leaf science and I'm like well I don't trust CBS or time or NBC I like I trust either of those the same as leaf science and well this is just an article with all stock photos from Shutterstock on it and not a single bit of sourcing or bibliography to go with it so generally that's a red flag to me that hey we use some fancy buzzwords and it's [ __ ] in this entire article really nice quote from dr. Tichina man look at that font bro glasses and must be true if it's leaf science yeah alright yeah I move on to over on YouTube Fleetline tails cracking me up he goes hey you don't want that guy that maintains the dead engine to beat high huh I'm the guy that makes the parts inside the jet engine and I'm high as [ __ ] I get high with that guy man all right man you see high by himself the definition man that's it's all and people can have talked about it before a bad you know feeling all that person's high or that like it my Mike it'll hear on the radio don't drive stone it's like so what in that I guess I did you know give you that look man when that that's all the weird is common I think I've seen on the show directed towards me this morning someone wants me to pregnat his daughter we're cleaning YouTube all right let's go to hey I did we got a fall for ambition port here and I want to kick it let's play this fall bread a little bit of prohibition report you guys have been calling into though it is at the eight three three four twenty twenty four twenty you got it over on dude gross calm it's up at the top left and we've been getting some calls so you guys that have called in will be featuring your [ __ ] but hey play this one this is out of a new higher it yeah hey what up guys love the show just a twenty-year-old grower live in New Hampshire and New England living in New Hampshire you live in between Massachusetts Vermont Maine and they're all slightly ahead of the medical and even a bit recreational so it creates a bit of a black hole market within the New Hampshire cannabis market so you can fell much much higher from taking stuff from Maine or Vermont and bringing it over to New Hampshire because it's pretty strict and it seems like law enforcement is the reason why and pass because quite frankly a lot of the profit comes from cannabis bust in New Hampshire and law enforcement do profit off of it in some way or some form but yeah you know I work at a hydroponic grow shop in New Hampshire and it's pretty legit we have a lot of people come over over the border to support it and I've been working under caregivers since I was 16 and a couple more months so I'm 21 and everything can be a [ __ ] it oh yeah shout out to the Jews grows keep it going so that's very cool I mean think I appreciate the update gave us a little market update let's talk about that for a second because I've actually been in New Hampshire before man I drove through there and there are some super rural sections but it's not too far from you know from Massachusetts and Boston and all that stuff so he's saying they've got a huge black market still there man very interesting no I mean there's gonna be a black market anywhere until all the states are legal like imagine the last state it's everywhere around it is is illegal but people are fighting over that like market but anyway there's still plenty of black market because there's not how many fully legal states do we have now we got what organ Washington's your Colorado I think Alaska yes or maybe like six or seven Washington DC yeah so man there's tons of black market so that oh yeah what does that mean and get yet guys get any report so we'll be playing some more and appreciate it but it doesn't remind you of like now that the cops are out busting we're gonna check something out in the news here in a second about that they're still busting people man and I mean like you go up there's there is still a black market that's it's alive and well and I'm kind of happy about that actually okay I don't know yeah I don't know man why do I always have to buy my pot in the store again I also go into the fact of why do I have to feel that I'm a - well you know so having the black market keeps ability for the man to get me into the system what everybody also run the risk of you could also just make a ton of money and not get caught by the man yeah you know I was kind of helping you make all that money yeah but about it I got a something that I have two friends that did three solid years for just sitting in a 20 lighter two separate people that were just kind of just didn't have much going on and life decided to grab their balls and go for it and then [ __ ] got caught and they lost three years of their lives man in their 40s and whatnot and that's a long [ __ ] time to sit in a cage alright so in the news first off I hope everybody out in Hawaii isn't getting too wet man that hurricane was thrown I think Hawaiian DGC out there you know what's up and joel bob but by 12 inches of rain in a couple hours and that kind of [ __ ] and like on one island they're gonna be like 30 inches of rain at craziness so yeah i hope everything is hanging okay out there but they did say in a story I was like so what happens when the news tells you it's gonna rain a lot there might be mudslides and this and that everybody runs to the store goes Hawaiian residents rushed to the stores to stock up on bottled water ramen and toilet paper so I guess those are the staples with its disaster time well with the ramen of course I get TP because everybody wants some TP like it's just insurance interesting to see like the top three items you know my wife was away for a week and I started the Uniting go to the grocery store I really didn't give a [ __ ] about food and I was just kind of looking to see like the last things that I could eat yeah that's Robin macaroni and cheese and ramen are kind of the things and I was like you know I was on that preservative kicks I wouldn't look and sure enough they're just loaded with all sorts of potassium sorbate and sodium phosphate oils weird [ __ ] man oh yeah you're gonna eat rum you should probably make your own broth not use the broth packet even the ramen itself as well I got my wine is this stuff like it's like borderline plastic why can no microbes like like microbes are living things and nothing living will even touch me for years figure out how plastic and feed the world might be able to solve two huge problems all right X news story Scottie this is you oh yeah man I can't I'm so sorry I don't have to somebody shared with this with me and Dan Chinese got busted again we kind of know of this guy from years ago and did you say Dan try like DN Dan Dan Chinese man oh I thought you were saying the damn Chinese got by Mike wait wait wait all right this is titled Denver police raid massive network of illegal grows in Colorado yes what was interesting about this they had on one block I think they said they rated six houses on one block and I'm pretty sure is mostly all asian people it goes the raids are targeted at a number of Asian restaurants which I've seen this firsthand they tie arrests you know just like you used to joke about the pizza place right sure but the restaurants you know they'd be the money laundering aspect of it and yeah pretty in I mean pretty interesting and what was your point in this story as far as you see I see pictures of all these plants they uprooted lane in the driveway oh that's a bad day yeah so what is this about I mean you can go buy this stuff in the stores right my point of this is the cops really do seem like they're on a power trip and like they're out of control on a power trip they go and they confiscate whether they get the guy's house or they get all the equipment or they get the cars they make money from these busts these buster are a revenue you know profit Center for the police they confiscate cars from it and and they just I mean this wasn't a single person with a home grow growing to supply himself this was basically this is a criminal enterprise running grow houses and selling out of state and wherever they can supply medicine out of state man wouldn't want people to get weed out of state would we no but you can look at it that way for sure I I nothing should happen from growing this plant but the bottom line you know you know there's Scotty is their there their money laundering they're bypassing the man if you will and that's it they're gonna have more serious charges on organized crime and not paying taxes and [ __ ] then they probably can these people but like I mean you you really you think that this is a good exemplification of what like cannabis in Colorado is like that people should I mean because Colorado affords us a lot of Rights it's Colorado sisters when it comes to cannabis sure we're allowed to carry what 2 ounces on you if you're a resident and you have a medical license it can be up to like 5 pounds right you can grow 12 plants at your house have six flowering six not mm-hm and they afford us a lot of rights in that respect sure I mean so as soon as I somebody suspects that I have too many plants in my house and the police the appropriate response for the pole I don't think that this was someone suspected they had too many plants in the house they I'm sure they caught these people with sales before they actually had sure warrants to go in there okay so and selling out of state I mean I mean this is as an advocate and think that this is [ __ ] up but they're in one of the most legal states and like free thinking when it comes to cannabis and they were they were violating the laws that Colorado affords absolutely so so knock on their door and have a conversation with them about it don't go in there with violence and and flash grenades and guns and I mean I see this whole world of violence that we have man and we make it ourselves man you know if you don't want if you don't want people shooting at each other man and don't show up and have explosions to gain access to the house I mean these guys are using flash grenades and showing up at a case I've been a victim of this [ __ ] man I've had an area none any K but a what is it now what are they use man ar-15s man yeah I've had cops bust in my house man have me my wife and my very little kid at gunpoint scared the [ __ ] out of us within his legal limit of plants right within had nine plants is what they got me with man and they treated me like a criminal couldn't give a [ __ ] about it and it just reminded me of a smash-and-grab you know there's a lot of variables of for law enforcement going into homes or whatever you know and I totally agree with what you're saying Scotty in the sense I mean you're not a registered firearm owner you know if law enforcement finds out that firearms in a home it's gonna be approached differently but yeah and there's a lot of different variables in how law enforcement acts and we've heard everything as horrifying as it's all getting shot - bangs being thrown in a kid's room like a flashbang and [ __ ] like that a dog getting shot what do you mean it's a miracle if your dog lives through a police raid bro as a member of my family man that's [ __ ] up yeah I agree in this situation this just ties in - yeah I mean you can't be cheating like you know the feds look at it as organized crime and tax evasion Alexis yeah and it being a bunch of being a bunch of Asians or Chinese does not help their cause I'm sure yeah so this is but I just think it's so crazy how quick the government is to come to violence when it comes to not paying their taxes this is a tax issue right here and so what do they do they bring in flash grenades and big you know big intimidation factor yeah tons of guns and ruining people's reputations in the neighborhood can't go back to that neighborhood anymore you know why cuz you had too many plants maybe because you're trying to make a little bit of extra money so selling some weed because everybody else is I just don't see why you got to ruin people's lives over it I agree sir yeah yeah you want to feel good story cuz as long as I do sir it's not bad it's just interesting man this is uh out of Bloomberg and it's this is how the press just I think today and it was Scott's miracle-gro tests whether it can make pot grow to such a creative article such a huge so so Scott's miracle-gro as betting as fertilizer can help cultivate a different kind of grass that's pretty key to adorable Jesus because Hawthorne gardening Ohio based companies best known for its gardening products but it has teamed up with a Canadian pot producer flower Corp how that's flour let's name it flour corn yes that's perfect yeah to build a 50,000 square foot research facility in British Columbia madam a vegetable crank at a job whoa and the lab will initially is gonna be used test Hawthorne's lights and nutrients on cannabis now what does that mean does that just mean botanic air gh Gavita I guess that means that they're going to invest in an R&D facility so that they can prove that their [ __ ] works and start coming out with a bunch of media hype I said win to the boycott start I'm just curious as I said they're gonna beat this facility is gonna use to test Hawthorne's lights and nutrients I'm assuming that's the companies they've already acquired that they're just trying to get because those companies botanic hair and gh haven't been able to directly ever show their products alongside your campus right sure so we have less durability up here what's that I'm just looking at posted it says keep your friends close and your enemies closer you know we've got these big alcohol companies coming in they've got these huge Lobby you know these losers lobbying power I don't know man you know yeah I don't like the real big out like that consolidation Branson and it's hard to swallow that pill like we've said because they've spent money on campaigns against cannabis so the way that the world works there's rules of power you know and I mean and you're not gonna it's not like oh well it's not fair because you guys hated us before and now that there's money to be made you like us so you know I mean it doesn't work like that they're gonna come in and they're gonna take yeah yeah yeah I agree as well as you know the small business [ __ ] man that stuff's important small business model small businesses you know like yourself with recharge you definitely you know what do I do the factory gets gets bought by Scott's a miracle girl I don't hold all the cards in this man interesting for that facility I'm not to see where it is I've never visited a 50,000 square-foot facility we like to check it out yeah you probably your first day at work there you'll be uh he doesn't feel great I mean she's man if I had a you know I might try and figure it out if that was my passion but no and he can't take that money you ain't a man or

THC feel like well I can tell you that it doesn't feel good it kind of feels like this okay so it's a little over two weeks ago that I was given ten drops of cannabis oil and the dosage was played down to me and I wasn't sure exactly how many milligrams I was taking it was said that it was diluted and very weak and I was given ten drops and I have never ever taken anything cannabis related in my life so obviously it's gonna hit me harder I wasn't planning to take it I thought the worst that can happen is I'm gonna be extremely relaxed and calm and I haven't really done a lot of research into THC and cannabis oil and the effects on what it does to you so I took the ten drops under my tongue kept it there had a bit of a bitter taste didn't taste much else and then afterwards found out that there was 500 milligrams of THC in those 10 drops so I didn't know if 500 milligrams was a lot or not because I've never really put much research into the actual effects and what the dose is is law when I read online that 500 is extremely high and I was seeing a lot of people there are regular cannabis oil users or THC users I saw how it affected them I thought to myself well I'm either gonna feel weird and go through like a sleepy zombie State or I'm just gonna feel okay so an hour went by I felt okay and I decided to leave the house because I actually forgot that I taken it I carried on swimming and we were doing a whole bunch of things as I was leaving my skin was so hot like it suddenly felt like in that split second I was fine doesn't feel anything in the next second it just hit me and my skin felt so hot like there was a con air blowing on me and it honestly felt like heat a so I went up to it and I faltered and when I put my hand closed it felt like cold air but as I stood back that that air blowing on my skin for that I was on fire I literally felt like I couldn't handle the heat the next thing that happened is just almost like the wall closing in and like tunnel vision and it was just black everywhere except right in front of my eyes and it felt like like like falling or furutaka like you at the top and as you drop it's like that whoop kind of feeling like everything closing in your stomach jumping and I was horrible I felt like whoa something's not right and then I remembered I took ten drops of cannabis oil and I thought to myself okay maybe it's bringing on some anxiety because I've suffered with anxiety attacks and I managed to calm myself down over the years and control it it just got worse and worse and worse my heart rate shot up so high that it I could feel it jumping on my chest now thought okay it's definitely anxiety but my heart the way my heart was going and felt completely different to anxiety so on my very very bad anxiety attacks where I've got rushed to the ER I had a heart rate of 140 beats a minute now if you think about it to put it in perspective your resting heart rate is about 60 beats a minute it can range between 60 to 100 but usually your resting heart rate is about 67 so 140 is for me if I'm boxing or if I am on a treadmill and I'm running or on the elliptical machine or skipping doing those intense things your heart rate is about at 140 so now I imagine being at a resting heart rate and suddenly shoot up to 140 where it feels like you're running on a treadmill and you're out of breath like you you're running that fast but you're not so your breathing doesn't match your heart rate your brain doesn't match your body's activity and everything's just out of synch so that's classic anxiety symptoms I thought to myself I just gotta calm down so much my heart rate shot up to a hundred and seventy two beats a minute now that's the highest I've ever seen it even when I've exercised and when I used to do MMA training my heart rate ever used to go to 172 I think 165 was the max I've ever seen my heart rate I felt like my heart couldn't take it I had this burning sensation through my chest like almost like when the letter s it is building up in your body and you're training hard and you feel like your muscle cannot take the weight if you lifting a little bit too heavy feels like I'm also gonna take I had that same kind of burning feeling in my chest and my heart was racing so fast on top of that I had this funny feeling like it was it was just like my heart couldn't cope with a the beats per minute and I lay on the bed I got managed to get to the bed and I was struggling to speak because my heart was going so crazy that I couldn't get the words out like I was freaking out inside and I was told with it that's the weird thing I didn't feel the effects of the THC besides those physical responses like I was I was going through all of this but in my mind I'm like just relax it's anxiety and even though my heart was that fast I'm like you're just gonna freak yourself out more and I was talking to myself to calm myself down using my diaphragm to breathe and slow my heart rate slow my breathing control everything but it just got worse and worse and worse when I checked my heart rates again and weights up to 180 and it wasn't like a panic attack where it stays high for long and then oops it just stayed constantly a tip from 180 dip down to 172 to 165 and it didn't go below 165 it was between 165 and 172 for about seven hours so even though the HC is considered safe there are extreme cases where there are complications so if your heart rate stays too high for too long you can have a heart attack my blood pressure was extremely high eventually we call the paramedics because I didn't feel like I was gonna make it now I've seen lots of stories of people taking too much and especially if it's their first time they think that they're gonna die and they have anxiety and freaked out I've been through so much anxiety over the years and has so many anxiety attacks where I was rushed to hospital and this fall so different my mind was still there like I was still thinking everything and I honestly felt like I was I was blacking out and my heart was going way too fast and my heart couldn't take it they called the paramedics the paramedics came my heart rate was still extremely high my oxygen saturation was so low because I wasn't breathing properly I was trying to control my breathing so much that I eventually slowed my breathing down so much that I stopped breathing basically they had to stand over me and told me to take deep breaths because I basically lost respiration and I wasn't getting enough oxygen in my body so I made a conscious effort to suck in air but I struggled so much to breathe it's almost like a disconnected feeling and I have read that so that you could become disconnected but you don't know where you are I knew exactly what was happening around me I could feel every single thing I could feel muscles in my face I could feel the inside of my ears I could feel all my muscles I could feel everything it's scary because then you start feeling so lame almost like I couldn't really move much then I would try shake myself like just like the little jerks and jumps to like wake myself up because I could feel like I was slipping away - I don't know passing out or blacking out and the funny thing is in that clip where you see me laying on the bed there my blood pressure was so high it was 190 over a hundred ten I think somewhere there and I thought I had glasses on I'd fought like you know when you put glasses on they're a little bit too tight and you can feel the bands on behind your ears I could feel that and because my blood pressure was so high my veins were so tight there I didn't have two losses on it was just those veins and the whole time I thought I had glasses on because of that feeling my blood pressure was extremely high my heart rate was way too fast and that's lost him for seven hours it's the last longer but off those first seven hours those were the worst so having a heart rate go that fast for that long it can be dangerous and having a blood pressure that high and if it rose higher along with that heart rate is extremely dangerous you could have a stroke you can have a heart attack it's very easy so even though it is a natural compound and there are no reported deaths from cannabis the complications or ever stating and I've never felt that scary in my life through all the anxiety attacks that I had and everything that I've been through with thoracic outlet syndrome that feeling right there was the scariest feeling I've ever had when I had anxiety I used to think that I was gonna die and eventually you know you're not gonna die even though you feel like it with us I just I couldn't control it obviously I take it such a high dose that my mind was only focusing on negative things as much as I was trying to stay positive and talk myself through it and the paramedics actually brought the stretcher they wanted to take me to hospital if my blood patient didn't go down and they stayed with me for a quite a while because I saw such tunnel vision and my blood pressure was so high I think I just like to zoned in I honestly thought that they took so many hours to get there and it felt like it was nighttime reading where in the clip you can see I'm laying there as it's fall early evening I think there was 10 past 6 or so so I was really like out of it I doesn't feel good at all my whole family around me none of them had ever seen me look that bad I didn't see myself making it out of it my heart was feeling so strained it was about three days after that that I still felt like I couldn't do anything because just getting off the bed walking around the house I felt like my heart was pumping so hard like it like it was overused then drained from the day before so it was just like the next week I had no energy I had left so much energy I wasn't myself at all I doesn't feel good I had the worst headache and obviously such a high dosage was way too high for my body to handle and I had no tolerance to it and it wasn't something that I've ever wanted to try or thought to try so it was a stupid decision to even want to try it and that's why I just got to be careful with what you take sometimes doctors will prescribe you medicines and things and they just don't work with your body they react differently and your experiences can be totally different to somebody else so you everyone can be laughing and having a great time and then you are freaking out and having the worst time and just now you get a complication and like I honestly thought that I wasn't gonna make it and it was an exaggeration because when I look back at the footage that I have the way I look in the video freaked out and not looking good at all my heart rate I got felt that and I can still feel that I can think about it and feel that scared feeling that I felt and it wasn't just because I was having some weird experience from the THC it was just it was pure anxiety and pure fear and yeah it's not something that I enjoyed at all I know I should have researched first it was one of us things that happen so fast that you make a stupid decision and it can affect you it was one of those kind of things because I love to research everything down to a tee before I take it when I had my thoracic outlet syndrome when I was on tremor doll I took like three tremor dolls and I threw the Box away because of all the first of all the way it made me feel I fall I couldn't feel like myself didn't take my pain away and all the side effects so I threw it away and cured myself naturally and this was just one of those things where it wasn't planned at all and just happened like in that split second I was like okay let me just take ten drops I mean what 10 drops gonna be and ya had the scariest 7 hours of my life fortunately I came right I eventually managed to stand after seven hours I managed to get up stand I felt horrible and weird and zoned out but I felt a little bit more relieved that I felt like myself I felt like it just slowed down enough to a point where I felt I felt okay and I could I could go home so yeah that's my experience it's a horrible experience now I know there's I've really got so many messages from people all over saying it took too much and if you want the right those who just message me or if you want proper CBD oil with no THC I'm not interested in any of those things I'm not interested in any of those kind of questions telling me that I took way too much because I know it took way too much for myself but this was just something I thought I'd share because there are so many websites that you read and and obviously it's promoted as a safe thing to take and obviously if it's measured properly and in the right dosages then it can be safe and it can be useful for many things but if you're just taking it and you don't have any knowledge about it and you're taking too much like I did it can be scary and it can be dangerous and just now you're taking a higher dose and your body can't handle it and you end up having a heart attack or stroke or something that could have been avoided because you don't know enough so I hope my experience can just hope somebody make the right decision and not just take some research first I have been struggling to train I've been back to training maybe once or twice but because I've been so busy at work I haven't like got myself back into training and making videos on regular basis so I'll get back to making all my podcast series that I was trying to work on before all of this happened I hope this can help somebody and at least make them think before they try something I'll see you guys soon", "oSCTQHCjLzs": "what's happening my true buds family it's good to have you here today if it's your first time tuning in my name's jack i do all types of edibles infusions and tons of other fun content on this channel so be sure to subscribe and check it out and see what's good today i'm answering a question i have gotten a lot how to calculate edible dosage let's dive into it and i assure you my buds it is very simple to figure out you're just going to need a couple pieces of information off the jump how much flour are you using in today's example we're going to be using a half ounce of flour and what is the strength of that flour what's the thc percentage see i'm fortunate i'm just going to read it off the back of here and it gives it to me 23.19 and if you don't know this but maybe you know the strain just going leafly or something look it up find you know the average percentage for that strain and you'll be good to go now that we're doing our example here so i'm doing a half ounce so that's 14 grams no matter the amount of grams you're using you're gonna times it by a thousand because there's a thousand milligrams in every gram so 14 times a thousand equals fourteen thousand five times a thousand equals five thousand and a simple way to remember this kind of bringing me back to grade school here just add three zeros to it so you're using ten grams add three zeros you got ten thousand so today we have fourteen thousand milligrams now i look at the back of this gelato pie here at the 23 percent so i take this 14 000 milligrams times 0.23 equals 3 220 milligrams that is our total thc in this half ounce that will be in our infusion not accounting for burn off or anything we'll get to that in a moment so we have 3 220 milligrams here and we're gonna be infusing this half ounce into one cup of coconut oil i like making my stuff extra strong so we have our infusion let's say it has this full amount we have a cup of coconut oil that has now been infused with three thousand two hundred and twenty milligrams so your recipe calls maybe you're making some no-bake granola bars you're making some cookies or something either way your recipe calls for a quarter cup simply take that three thousand two hundred and twenty divide by four and you're left with 805 milligrams so in that batch let's just say of cookies you're going to have 805 milligrams now let's say you made 10 cookies 805 divided by 10 equals 80 milligrams per cookie there it's really simple about like that and you're good to go now i don't even know why i've been putting off this video just i wrote it down a couple times and i forgot to be honest with you i got a question recently that kind of sparked it in my mind now you might be saying in some of my other videos actually most of my videos i get a lot of trim and shake that's like mixed together from friends that friends give me all this and i don't know the thc percentage so i can't calculate it at all so what do i do i use the t check ii potency tester this thing has been a lifesaver for me while the math you know can give you a pretty basic answer and it's great to know especially you know if you don't have a t check or you can't afford it or whatever it's good to have that math on the back end but like i said i'm using trim and shake i don't know the percentage so when i'm giving people stuff if i didn't have this to test it i would be even more like be careful i'm like be careful when people are taking edibles anyway start slow but this thing has helped me a lot now i'd mentioned something burn off earlier this can happen so there's a potential for some of the thc to burn off when you're decarbing your bud decarboxylation is the process of activating your thc so you're left with an active product you can also do a passive infusion as well but you know you could still have some burn off there so let's say we're doing what i do in most of mine which i decarb so there might be a little burn off there then you put it in your crock pot stove or whatever there might be a little more burn off during the infusion i love using the levo too i doubt there's really any burn off there and then depending how you're making it so say you are making cookies and you're baking them at a certain temperature there is going to be some thc burn off there so that total number of the 80 what did i say 80.5 milligrams per cookie probably won't be that high it'll probably go down a little bit because there will be some burn off now if you made the no bake balls you know that doesn't require going in the oven it might be a little higher these are just little things i wanted to bring up in terms of finding the percentage but it's just a really good baseline to find it like that just total grams times a thousand to get the milligrams times thc percentage and you're good it's worth knowing if you're making your own edibles and it's definitely worth checking out the t-check too as well i'll put that below this thing also text uh test alcohol tinctures it tests olive oil coconut oil butter it even has a flour expansion kit where you can test your flour so maybe if you didn't even know the strain you could test the flour and do it that way but you might as well just test the infusion too so that's that my friends you're having a good day drop a question if you have a question because i'm always curious welcome to the true buds family if it's your first time and if you're already part of the fan you know i love you guys so i'll see you on the next one let's burn one down and uh have a good rest of our day night morning wherever you may live i hope you're doing well and i hope things are going great and i hope this little mathematic equation found you well you", "op9D2tYVMcY": "Oh golly dokely everyone we are live here on this episode of wheats oh stream offline nope we're back we're back we're back we are here we are back on this wheats live this thank you to all of Reddit and all of our slash trees that came and supported us earlier in the week which was really really helpful so today as the thumbnail suggested and the name suggested I I'm gonna bite the bullet do the thing that I've always been too scared to actually do and that is review the Korova black bar all by myself just me I'm not gonna do it all at once because I'm too much of a coward but we're gonna do the whole thing guys over the course in the next couple of hours here we're gonna get really [ __ ] high together and I'm probably gonna fail spectacularly just letting you know just setting up expectations right now this is probably gonna be a failure I got my braids in my hair I'm ready to go oh I also came in case you didn't notice from the the picture I've got my beard brush here I know right it was really really disappointed with my my beard so I want to show them my grooming techniques and make sure they understand that I take care of this here I appreciate my beard I give it the love and attention it so deserves I even bomb it on occasion beard balm Amish made or something I can't remember it's good it keeps it soft alright well how is everyone doing today um I am nervous as all hell I'm very very nervous about this effin brownie um to give a little bit of history I think this is the third one of these I have done maybe fourth I have failed twice and I have done it once with the wheats co-host the wheats co-host and I split one one time over the course of like 4 hours we both got super high i got higher than he did but there are two failed attempts in the wheats vaults as well of me failing this i appreciate you a mr. Comanche oh I know I can do it I know I can do it too so let's just go ahead and open it right now and let's do a little bit let's just start it off nice and easy you know what so let's not go crazy here okay so yes I fail twice in the past on personal level and I succeeded doing it with somebody else but I got really high just doing half of it so hopefully all this Kanak oh I've been doing recently though is getting me primed because I've been doing a lot of Kanaka reviews and they are potent as hell all right I've got my Arnold Palmer here Arizona tea $0.99 great value great Buy you know just to keep me hydrated over this stream and to help me choke down this brownie because if I remember correctly it doesn't taste very good ah delicious okay so here we are here is our oh [ __ ] all the iciness melted off let's try to scoop it out so that's all the mint icing that should be on it but is it okay guys okay here we go so this is what it looks like pretty ugly I just sort of smeared that icing back on it is remarkably small for a thousand milligrams edible I mean this thing is freaking tiny dude it's um uh you know let's see if ways does it say on here somewhere I don't know it can't weigh more than an answer so super super super tiny and super super potent smells a lot like wheat it does not smell tasty it does not smell tasty at all the mint odor so sort of helps cover it up a little bit but it is not the tastiest or the best smelling there okay well let's go ahead and cut off the chunk here I'm thinking about doing a third to start with there we go so here is the first portion of our Korova 20 dose medical cannabis mint black bar whew that's not good mmm log weed taste to it glad I have this bad boy here rest in peace Arnold Palmer rest in peace it does not taste good Oh God Oh so here's what we've done so far by the way gents ladies and gents we've done about a third or we've chopped off a third of our this brandy I'm gonna finish this third right here tastes terrible really bad wrong we taste light we taste whoa oh my dog just left let's do if we can get a dog back in here dog I've got three let's see which one shows up you dog hey dog Judy new yeah all right we got a dog gonna get waiting for this brownie take effect oh that taste Doug took my headphones off buddy story about that dog by the way real quick I don't have side that dog her name's Newt she's a border collie mix smart dog nice dog she's six so she's in her middle ages when we got her we wanted a big big dog we went to the shelter um picked up a dog they actually thought she was a great pyrenees mix and so when we got the dog they're like how big do you want your dog to be and I said I wrote on the little formulas like oh I don't know 50 pounds and this woman laughs she's like this dog is gonna be way way bigger than 50 pounds so I was like oh man I knew I wanted a big dog but I was a little nervous I was gonna get something huge well rest assured she weighs 25 pounds they were way way wrong about what she was she's no great pyrenees mix she's a she's a border collie Mike's very very very different kinds of dogs but we compensated for our second dog and we got a great day about as big as you can get okay so the first third of that brownie is down now we play the waiting game which is getting high got to wait for myself to get high that's the thing about these live reviews is yeah you just have to kind of wait for them to come on so let's talk guys let's get I got the gift of gab we can talk about any questions you want you have questions I've got answers I can talk about dogs I can talk about wheat I can talk about edibles I can talk about physics I can talk about astronomy I can talk about cosmology I can talk about oh geez anything you just you just let me know oh that brownie still tastes terrible dude still tastes terrible okay let's talk about about edibles guys I'm gonna tell you what kind of edibles and companies you need to be purchasing what you need to be looking out for and things around the country so the cardinal rule I have discovered with edibles thus far guys is certainly o Washington Post Alert here we go mimimi North Korea the North Korea threat isn't keeping many Alaskans awake at night I'm worrying about moose not missiles thanks Washington Post that is a shitty thing to update me for I thought we were gonna get some like real announcements you know maybe North Korea was gonna nuke us here on the west coast or something what dosage do I recommend for beginner edibles great question Camacho now Camacho my question to you is what do you mean by a beginner do you mean a beginner like you just started smoking or have you been smoking for a while and want to move into edibles because there's a very big difference there I would say I mean I would still start small either way but if you've never if you're like a beginner smoker if you're a beginner just in cannabis in general you basically want to stay at the absolute lowest dosage if you've smoked before you can go ahead and go up to something a little bit more potent so let's say you're a seasoned smoker mister Camacho or miss Camacho I don't know I don't want to impose either way if you're a seasoned stoner you could probably start moving in edibles okay good good good good moving in edibles I would say go ahead and start with in what part of the country do you live in because if I would give you some recommendations for actual products if you live on the west coast some good beginner ones if you live in Colorado or something all their products are different excuse me Colorado all the products are very different and I don't the names but I would suggest that you start with chocolate bars Oh Mississippi ooh ouch ouch ouch ouch I mean no offense the Mississippi I know Mississippi happens to be oh oh you have been Callie oh you live in California okay I'm sorry um yeah start with a chocolate bar grab a bang bar or a kiva and just go with a piece of that for your first go so like if you live in California grab any of the Kiva's I think they actually sell them in 60 milligrams grab one of those eat half of it that'll do you if that's your first time as an edible 30 milligrams from kiva that'll get you feeling pretty good I guarantee it so yeah I'd start with that maybe bang bar bang bars come in 120 180 and 240 I would stick with chocolates I Dana III I would I would respectfully disagree with you gummy bears i I just don't find a lot of good gummies out there for me but they are lower potency I find so maybe you will like the gummies more I'd stick with the chocolate because it's just more the chocolate seems to always be more consistent so I would grab a chocolate bar beg borrow or kevo lowest dosage you can find and start small you can always us you can always go up you can never go down on dosage so yeah I would go ahead and grab yourself a akiva or a bang bar that you can find start with the half of the smallest dosage you can find and then I'll get you right where you want to be probably but rest assured mr. or mrs. Camacho yes chocolates are super super blissful uh it really just depends everybody's gonna respond to edibles differently that's sort of the crazy thing about edibles some people you know even the lowest dosage even for the most seasoned stoner is gonna put them in bed and some people I have seen who you know don't even smoke that often seem to be impaired to all edibles I've got a friend who can eat a 500 milligram Kanak oh and barely feel it I mean to me that is you know that's nuts to that that puts me in the hospital just about some it really just depends but I would stick with you chocolates lower dosage to begin with now if you guys have done edibles before and you're looking for recommendation what is that I don't know what that is but I would love to know if you can tell me so guys um if you done edibles before and you're just looking for the best of the best of the best of the best out there well Korova little crew who were reviewing here today is uniformly excellent um almost all their products are great all the products are great in terms of potency some are not as tasty as others oh oh okay oh well look at that mr. mr. sing I did not know that that's really cool um like sort of molecular lean there are molecular similar to THC sort of like the molecule is similar is that how that works the more you know really I had no idea they go together like peas and carrots chocolate and THC sakharova guys core biz excellent all their products are great in terms of potency except stay away from their salted caramel blondie if you don't want to puke cuz that thing tastes disgusting I'm sorry Korova if you see this video and I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings but your salted caramel blondie really does taste terrible and you should just not make that product or tweak the recipe cause it's gross it's gross it's gross gross gross it's gross it's gross it's really gross it's so gross okay but this but most of their stuff is really good some of it is actually delicious a lot of a lot of their their edibles actually if you're a first-time STONER stick with their 150 milligram anibal's oh my god that Saturday morning breakfast cookie or my favorite edible ever the or my one time favorite edible ever we're gonna have to talk about canna Co the ginger chew oh my god guys if you like molasses cookies or ginger cookies the kirova ginger chew is a [ __ ] great cookie [ __ ] everyone ever amazing edible what's up ace everyone has different taste buds yes we do all our tongues are different we all have different taste receptors in different places but it's not at all like we were taught in when you're learning about taste buds we don't actually have little spots on our tongues like back isn't salty in front isn't sweet all that it's really more jumbled together in more nuance than that and we were taught in them in middle school you love the salted caramel blondie how dare you that's okay I forgive you for that I I wish I could like it I really do wish I could like it I actually tried it three different times just to make sure I wasn't screwing up and wasn't going to talk [ __ ] about Krupa unnecessarily but I hated it all three times what can you do but I'm glad that you loved it I am glad that you enjoyed it what's my opinion on concentrate bait pens or do you prefer bud I think there's a difference in high and milligrams can that show uh let's see oh and I'm calling you Comanches Camacho Camacho I'm sorry jeez sorry Camacho I like the bait pens I prefer whoa so Dane was letting us know that they sent me percent more tests aside for tested for pests fi pesticides and fungicides which is really a little redundant because pesticide just covers all like insecticides herbicides fungicides that's what pesticide means but that's neither here nor there I always say that because I was briefly worked in an entomology but briefly I worked in an entomology lab studying bedbugs for two years which was a really really [ __ ] up job um kind of gross actually studying bedbugs uh are you my studies am I dreaming nonstop for the next five hours wants to know Katie Katie my twitter is a tweets reviews I think let's check it out and I might be trying to stop stream for the next five hours straight if I don't pass out somewhere along the way and yes Katie my actual friend Katie how are you by the way the Twitter handle is a tweets reviews w ee ATS re v is not that I can't respect or anyone what I did for some people but but I didn't know that about their the Pens that they were tested tested for pesticides and fungicides meaning that I that when they sort of processed the bud the bud had pesticides and herbicides in it is that what that means is that the buds had or that that that had fungicide I don't know that's [ __ ] up I didn't I haven't heard about that but between the two I do prefer just straight-up bud over the pens if it came to the to the ABS are in general under fire for pesticides really I did not know that I mean is it is it because the bud that that the concentrates come from is being hit with pesticides and fungicides or where is there something in the process that they're using pesticides for it oh okay okay that is really disappointing that is really disappointing um do you know uh I wonder if there are any pen brands that aren't jeez those are some pretty harsh chemicals actually um well maybe avoid the Pens for now guys maybe stick with the flower nature's nature's pen but if the concentrates have pesticides I would assume at some point they're gonna find pesticides in the flower because it comes it's the same thing it's just not processed it's not you know melted down with butane or whatever I actually don't know exactly how the process works to to make concentrates I know it involves butane in some way but other than that you had a chick asking you to get a pen I would say it's still gonna be okay to get her a pen amateur hour squared I don't think it's gonna get her cancer on you know one single pen go ahead and get her that pen she's gonna be fine but maybe in the future Arizona half-and-half the way to go oh boy not even halfway guys I'm only a third of the way in dude and yes this is a half and a half Arnold Palmer Oh funny story about my boy learn the Palmer r.i.p I actually thought he was dead already earlier this year I thought Arnold Palmer was who's that golfer that died in the plane crash in the 90s um we're gonna have to look him up golfer Payne Stewart Payne Stewart I think I thought Arnold Palmer was Payne Stewart and on the day Arnold Palmer died I was telling somebody that story like oh I love Arnold Palmer drinks it's too bad that he's dead and they're like no he's not dead he's still alive I was like no he died in a plane crash in the 90s remember that plane that like crashed because everybody in the cabin had depressurized and number has passed out and they could have saved him then it just crashed and everybody died was I going on Palmer was in that plane he was like no you dummy Payne Stewart was on that plane sure enough Payne Stewart was on that plane and that very same day Arnold Palmer died what a coincidence also do you guys know what we call the studies of coincidences we call it stochastic studies isn't that fun if I could go back in time I would be a stochastic soon I think I would study randomness because randomness is about the most fun awesome cool subject that there is I would totally be a stochastic if I could go back and do it all over again or a data scientist or I'd be a number theory I don't know man it's all so great oh it's all so great I need some ice cream to go with that black bar shame you are not wrong that would actually absolutely help get that down what is my favorite strain boring I'm boring Comanche my favorite strain is gorilla glue number four love it love it love it it's smoking all day hurry day grill glue number four pretty basic but pretty wonderful I see you're a fan of the OG Kush and white our fire I've never tried white our fire before is that a sativa we're an indica oh man starting to get warm - I'm not have to turn this a/c on if it doesn't bother you guys too much sound wise Lord ask mercy it's some old-ass hippie in Brevard in Florida well cool um but yes so uh Arnold Palmer died on the same day that I told everybody he was already dead but meant Payne Stewart I think that's who I mean is Payne Stewart some golfer died in the 90s in a plane crash it was really tragic I don't I think the story went the plane depressurized in midair and everybody passed out and basically the FAA knew about it and they wanted to save everybody but they couldn't and they basically just realized everybody was doomed until this plane ran out of gas and was going to crash it was awful um Ben s asked do edibles always hit all at once or you can you spread it out over an hour well what I'm doing is yes amateur hour squared is right it usually comes on much more like a wave it sort of comes over and crashes over you it's not an instant hit like like if you did a dab it's sort of as he's saying it sort of perfectly describes it it it comes on slowly it's sort of crescendos crescendos crescendos and at some point it Peaks and then it comes down nice and smoothly again it is a very very long process too especially if it's the first time doing edibles I mean this the process could go on like six hours or something new but you always don't the one thing I like to tell people Ben is you don't have to do the entire edible at all at once just try a small portion of it wait an hour see how you feel and then go back and do some more if if you're not yet super high so yeah Ben s just grat if you have an edible do a third of it at the beginning see how you feel in an hour if if you're not yet feeling like you want to be do a little bit more and keep going that way that's my advice to you which is exactly what I'm doing here with this giant ice brewing dan says if I get higher I get higher if I space it out over 30 minutes or so but friends of mine like to eat it all at once I when I am NOT doing weeks reviews actually like to spread it out over a good amount of time as well I like to spread it out over probably an hour eating and edible my favorite thing in the world to do is to go to the movie theater grab an edible eat a little bit of a half an hour before the movie eat some during the previews and then eat something during that first half hour and just get higher and higher as the movie goes on [ __ ] incredible especially if you go to one of those theaters that have those recliner chairs oh man that is heaven on earth man I love it well guys I can already uh oops muted myself here I can already feel this brownie starting to hit in we're only 25 minutes in and I'm only eating a third of it but I can already feel it coming in as as amateur hour squared we're subscribing comes on in a wave and the wave is beginning to rise we are a big flowing flow flow abbis back flow is in we're flowing the tightest plug have I ever been one of those restaurant theaters you know I have amateur hour squared and I have been there high before and it is awesome mixed with a little bit of revulsion let me describe why say revulsion because it is so [ __ ] awesome that you're in a movie theater you recline all the way back in a chair you've got people coming and giving you massive mounds of food as a movies playing you've got 32 ounce sodas you feel like a slob but it's [ __ ] great it's so awesome oh my god I love it I would I would I would live in a diner in theater if I didn't feel so bad doing it I always feel I feel bad I feel bad for the server's who have to like take your food out to you in the middle of a movie when everybody's like recline it's got to be weird to be a server and like put food in some somebody state in front of somebody who's laying down at a 90-degree angle that just seems odd to me but I love them I do have you ever been to one amateur-hour squared have you ever been to one of the restaurant theatres there quite a few of them here in Southern California now the more important question though when it comes to movie theaters is have you guys ever been to a 4dx before I have been to them several times before and boy are they a blast the 40x theaters are you should go if you get a chance amateur-hour squared go to one of this restaurant theaters you'll love it but the 40x theaters are incredible so it's basically like turning a movie into a theme park right I know what you're thinking it's one of those theaters with like the moving chairs you're thinking how fun could that be I haven't share that news it's fun it's fun I want to eat a steak and watch a shitty DC movie with IMAX here here sir here here that is the way to do it because all DC movies are shitty well I guess Wonder Woman was pretty good I enjoyed that I thought all the other ones were pretty shitty but Wonder Woman was pretty good alright guys I know we're only half an hour end but I think I'm going to eat a little bit more of this brownie right now so I'm gonna not do a whole third I'm gonna just do a little slice here all right down the hatch oh we're bad real bad okay back to 40 X liters which are awesome not like the taste of that the way they work you got movement chairs so you're rocking and you're rolling during your movie not just up they've got done water that sprays in your face they've got smell-a-vision like legit the absolute stuff oh dude amateur hour squared I got a straight up phobia of milk it's such a rare phobia they don't have a name for it but I'll just go and make one up right now I have lacto phobia let's see if anybody's ever done that before it isn't me I've lacked a phobia yes I have a fear of milk I know what you're thinking that's can't possibly possibly true possibly be true nobody can actually have a fear of milk some hemp milk LEM but do I have a fear of milk dude it's disgusting it comes from the cow's udder it's gross I haven't had milk since I've been three years old I don't even know what it tastes like yeah I ain't assumed it tastes disgusting but I just couldn't imagine drinking it no offense but it's the devil's juice no but it probably wouldn't help me get that done you're [ __ ] with me there isn't there is a fear of milk Galla phobia or lacta phobia I was right it's the fear of milk the fear is developed because of their sour lactase intolerance to lactose or even drinking spoiled meals that taste yucky probably one of those things when I was a child I haven't had it since isn't that [ __ ] crazy that is that is pretty crazy yeah well I have it yeah I've got me some gala phobia or lacto phobia whatever you want to call it so unfortunately I can't drink it um yeah I also have a fear of what else oh Jesus I've got a lot phobias I hope we all do I've got a phobias of public speaking I've got a phobia drugs I've got a phobia dogs I've got a phobia on the Internet I've got a phobia of you know just just about everything but I'm also into exposure therapy so that's why I'm doing this right now um yeah so uh oh god guys that brownie is already hitting I am definitely feeling it definitely definitely feeling it already getting pretty high only a half an hour into you're afraid of horses and dolphins horses make sense but amateur hours squared how the hell are you afraid of dolphins exposure therapy you say yes yes so there's a phobia of milk and a phobia of sour milk a ser phobia is the fear of sour milk I'm afraid of both milks in my life the best prank ever pulled on me actually was I was in college and somebody knew I had this fear of milk knocked on my door hid underneath of it so I couldn't see him through the peephole and then as I opened the door two people jumped out with super soaker stood with milk and sprayed me down it was terrifying there was a good prank I gave him credit for it after I was done screaming yeah I don't have any phobias of dogs kenia's being facetious nor do I have a fear of public speaking dolphins have weird-ass teeth in the right they do have weird a steep and they are known for being amorous with both humans and other dolphins they have made love to humans against their will before yes yes yes yes yes but it's hard to say whether animals are capable of the R word I don't think I'm allowed to say that word I don't know maps got some serious studies using MDMA and exposure therapy to cure PTSD and it's phase 3 FDA trials boy doesn't everybody have some incredible great research about MDMA ecstasy or hallucinogenics being used to Dupre to treat PTSD or depression and how absolutely promising those studies are but we've got a pretty dumb government that doesn't want to fund them and me I'm all for it I think I think we need to be putting more and more money into research with hallucinogenics and the ecstasy MDMA all those kind of drugs in terms of treating PTSD because PTSD is obviously a huge huge huge problem in the United States right now um that's a real fear of dolphin rapes oh [ __ ] dolphins have been known to Wow that is pretty disturbing but is it still our work because I and I don't know it is pretty easy to avoid both dolphins and horses horses you might run into if you live in a crowded city when the police officers come through with their horses or if you live in the countryside but dolphins you don't ever have to see a dolphin in your life if you don't want to unless you're in a third game in classroom and you got a lot of girls with there at least two franc notebooks but that might be the only place you ever need to be exposed to dolphins weird that excellent episode of king of the hill where Hank gets molested by a dolphin one of my favorite episodes of an incredible TV show king of the hill all of you guys need to be watching king of the hill always always always constantly because king of the hill is great I'm pretty sure there are YouTube channels that are just dedicated to like showing live king of the hill let's go ahead and just give you guys my favorite joke of all time from king of the hill I tell this to everybody that I know personally all the time because it's such a wonderful joke you have to know the characters to know why it's funny but if you've ever seen king of the hill trust me you all understand why it's funny so bill is seeing Puff the Magic Dragon in the alley he's going and Hank goes boom you kids sing that song don't you know what it's about and then he kind of looks around for a little bit and he goes it's about a dragon that it's the best joke ever written of all time in the history of jokes I did anybody to come up with a better job than that Mike Judd is a complete genius in that joke is as incredible as ever Dane I am NOT celebrating this year's shroom fest but I would love to I actually just had my first experience on shrooms a couple of months ago I did not do enough of them unfortunately to get where I wanted to be I'm more or less sort of micro ghosts on them I guess I experienced a little bit of something but nothing approaching anything that you could call hallucination I sort of more just enhanced senses enhanced sensory perception I would describe it but I would love to celebrate shroom fest in the future I think mushrooms are a wonderful drug with tons of tons of therapeutic potential if only we could allow ourselves to do it but so far we're not doing it okay guys this is how a my eyes doing are we getting red yet not yet no red in there just yet but we'll get there we'll get there uh three and a half grams is pretty standard for a real trip I actually I wish I had measured it out ahead of time I don't know how much I had done it seemed like a substantial amount but but it I I definitely was not was definitely not high the highest I've ever been Ryan bonds L is well outside like the first four times I smoked which the uniformity is for pretty much everybody the highest they've ever been but outside of that the highest I've ever been would probably be the first time I ever made firecrackers so if you've never okay no I'll respond to you in just a second oh you can make it five hours I doubt it no we're gonna make it five hours but yes the highest I've ever been was the first time I ever made firecrackers I had probably 10 grams maybe 15 grams of dried a big bud big but I used a packs so I had like maybe 10 to 15 grams of a bud it didn't even need uh maybe I don't know a third of that maybe five grams in one firecracker which is a graham cracker with some like Nutella or peanut butter baked in the oven for a little bit with just the vapor but in there first time I made it oh my god I done edibles already - I had done many edibles I mean not an outrageous man I started maybe two months but prior to that I started doing edibles but I guess they just overdid it the first time I mean firecrackers and holy [ __ ] I didn't with a with with my partner and I remember we were on the couch after we ate them and I was like oh I'll go pick up some food so I left to walk to go pick up some food and as I was paying it's when it hit me I went oh [ __ ] it was not like a wave at all it hit me like a sack of bricks which is super uncharacteristic for for edibles but I was in line getting ready to pay and then the ton of bricks dropped on me and I was like I don't know how I'm gonna make it home I somehow was able to pay I think it took me 3 or 4 swipes to get the card going right managed to carry the food back I think it took me five minutes to walk there in about 20 minutes to walk back never made never got the food even in the refrigerator made it to the the couch to where my partner was sort of grabbed at wish where the partner is and then fell asleep for the next six hours and the poor food was never eaten because it went bad because I never even gotten the originator so that was the highest I've ever been the first time first and only time I've ever green doubt so uh Dane says that my first trip was shrooms was actually spot on the allergen spore test is important I feel like blasting yourself on shrooms has been fetishized hardcore that is probably true I was actually really interested in doing it for therapeutic reasons shrooms so I probably went in a more intense than I needed to at the beginning but I didn't end up getting high anyways and yes five grams of a avb which I can now do pretty easily but back then it put me a total couch lock not I mean it knocked me out to be entirely honest mean it I was passed out it was the only time it's ever happened but I did get couch lock oh my god firecrackers me and my friends who rarely smoke at the time makes them for a beach trip we all fall asleep talk wire compete in the middle so I feel like they're zombies with a fire going down the Sun setting my eyes all clear like the beginning of a zombie movie beautifully written I yes that's the way it felt for me too I remember waking up it's like six hours later and still feeling like I was the Walking Dead I'm glad somebody need to put a bullet right between my eyes turn sort of reset everything but yet so first time doing firecrackers definitely the highest I've ever been in my entire life outside of like the first time I was smoking and the first time I was smoking a loop everybody has a similar experience excuse me sometimes those things make me kind of belchy which is a gross work yeah the first time I smoked which is about five years ago now [ __ ] I got I wonder if everybody's experiences are similar to mine time sort of skipped for me that was the my first experience getting high I did get high the very first time I smoked it took like three bowls I smoked didn't feel anything insisted I wasn't feeling anything I was like guys I got a smoke smell this is this is [ __ ] I'm not feeling anything what is this and then just like the firecracker hit me all at once like a sack of bricks I sat down on the couch some community reruns were playing and then I was like why is time on why it's time like a CD from the 90s a scratch TV from the 90s just skipping skipping skipping skipping skipping I felt like it was only present for every other second or so every every other second just didn't exist at that point I which was both a slightly nerve-racking and wonderful feeling that's only the second time I've ever felt that experience the first two times I smoked with the only two times I felt that that sense of like time dilation of time just sort of being all messed up if I had a time fast forward and slow down went on you know in stuff or away in Custer that is good great question how long is this stream gonna last I don't know I really don't I'm already super high I'm let's take a look at how much this brownie I've got through here oh [ __ ] I'm only about halfway through this brownie another four hours and 15 that's a fun schedule oh boy I'm already surprised we're gonna make it through the Bernie that is guaranteed guys we're gonna make it to this but any for sure what happens to me if I maybe the camera will just be pointed you know like at the floor I actually have a futon mattress right over here in the corner for the dogs maybe I just end up on that with the [ __ ] pillow at some point and point the camera at me who knows it's gonna be a real adventure that's all I know is this is just gonna be an adventure you're probably gonna get knocked out of I'm probably gonna get knocked the [ __ ] out on camera I'm almost certain of it I'm going to be down there with this poo emoji pillow crying later and it's all gonna be my fault mine and nobody else's what's taking another nibble a brownie men the longer it stays out the worse it tastes Thank You Arnold Palmer you're my only hope well tastes so bad continues to taste bad all right guys um let's let's move on to a new subject and that is my new favorite company canna Co I've talked a lot about Kanak oh I've talked a lot about canna Co but guys if you have any opportunity to get some canna co-products you've got to try them they're like magic dug dirt they operate on what about almond milk you know I've never actually tried almond milk or any of the different nut milks almond milks soy milks oh well what are the other ones there there are tons of them I had coconut milk well that's the different kind of milk altogether that's not like that's just sexual coconut milk the juice of coconut but uh maybe I should give those a try but I feel like because I have whatever that gala phobia I can go ahead and be afraid of all milk so I'm just gonna say I'm not gonna do any more no almond milk for me either but back to calico briefs briefly guys catechu is ambrosia there it's the nectar of the Gods they are the best edible company running right now for sure in terms of potency consistency and taste I've reviewed out most of their products except for their any of their thousand milligram line which why would you ever do that to yourself I don't think I'll ever review a Kentico thousand milligram I don't need a chemical thousand milligram a 500 milligram as you saw in my one of my recent reviews nearly killed me so I don't think I need to try a thousand milligrams for any reason ever I can't imagine what it would be like that would be the highest I would ever be if I would do one of those and I'm certain it would taste better than the Korova thousand milligram - which hurts me to say because I love coma they used to be my favorite but Kentico has supplanted them and you just gotta go um you just got to go with who you love do I ever baked wax I do I use a nectar collector here are my smoking methods in terms when I smoke the way I smoke most often is I use a volcano which is hiding behind the galaxy back there and that closet I'm a volcano vaporizer numero uno second is nectar collector dabbing from nectar collectors third would be bud fourth would be baked pens I knew them all at different times but volcanoes my favorite followed by dabbing by a nectar collector I find the nectar collector that'd be the only easy way to dab rigs I find too hard like having a scoop and hold and blowtorch all at the same time nectar collector is pretty easy you just sort of like like humming merge style you dip it in and suck it up that was kind of foul but that's the way I love it but I do I do big whacks through a nectar collector but my favorite way to vape is again through the volcano and then you get a bunch of abb as well which you can use to make firecrackers with which i've got some in my freezer right now so yes i do they uh let's see uh guys let's talk about how shitty LOL edibles is i've never had anybody from Ella edibles contact me I've talked to people talk I've had brief interactions with people from Kanak Oh Buddha's best Korova somewhere else I've never heard any from anybody from hello edibles probably because I [ __ ] talked them so much I think lol edibles is a very large brand there seem to be everywhere in Southern California especially like Orange County Los Angeles County area I see them everywhere but largely they just seem to be a scam to me their cereals are pretty good in terms of the cereals they're lying about their potency they say they're 400 milligrams they're not they're like you know 150 or whatever but they're not bad I think I like the baked goods better but other than that all their stuff truly doesn't do anything and it's sad that they persist and get to be in business and that's kind of what I would like to do with wheats is have a little maybe a little bit a sort of advocacy and maybe you guys could go out there every time you go to a dispensary and just say like don't stalk lol edibles in your dispensary because you know they don't do anything for anybody all the comments on my lol edibles would be you seem to suggest that most people don't get high from their [ __ ] um and they seem to be all over the place so unless there's have some really sweet deal with them you know a distributor or something I don't know why they're there if they suck so badly they're so shitty I know when I go to dispense rates from now on if they ever asked my opinion I'll tell them get rid of yellow edibles stock something new put something new in you'll make your customers happier Eldar edibles is [ __ ] who else's [ __ ] Oh gummies in general but we don't need to rehash that yummies are always bad but in terms of just people who aren't good elwell edibles people I feel like need more credits is punch bar punch bar makes really really [ __ ] good edibles and they're small they're discreet little tiny 225 milligram packages I don't see them enough I always see them I think I've seen them at like two dispensaries and I just basing on like the traffic of views on mice on weights they don't seem to get watched that often which I assume correlates to how often they get purchased which is a bummer because punch bar is pretty [ __ ] good and I think they deserve better than more sales than they're getting so punch bar give it a chance okay uh is it time for more brownie I don't know probably not I am already I'm already feeling it I'm this is terrifying this is going to be rough and you have to get something else to drink to finish that - oh boy okay so that's my dog squid he's a border collie here border collie we got him because our other original dog that we thought was a great pyrenees was not and turned out to be a border collie and we realized border collies our ball and a stock so we got a border collie and he comes from an actual sheep farm he was he's an actual herding dog from hurting stock lines so probably not good for an apartment but you know that's the way ours sweet oh say hi buddy yes oh yeah he's a dog have I ever made my own edibles just firecrackers just firecrackers or a Lancaster I'm not talented enough yet to do my own edibles I would like to in the future try to make some my own edibles especially just starting with cannabutter and working from there but I have not yet done that mostly because I find it is I actually find it cheaper just buy edibles then to make your own because if you convert flour prices and buy flour I don't mean the cereal I mean the I mean weed if you convert like weed grammage into like a Korova black bar it's like a Korova black bar has 20 grams of dried cannabis in it it says right here somewhere you might go to see that yes contains 20 grams of dried cannabis you probably can't read that but that's what that says now if you do that math and convert it 20 grams is like almost how much is announced like 27 grams grams in an ounce oh it's 28 grams twenty-eight point three or four grams is it an ounce and an ounce of weed it's like $200 and that Korova black bar has 20 grams of weed of marijuana in it so if you do the math out it would cost a hell of a lot more to make your own Korova black bar than it would - yes but it would be shitty it would be still be so yeah a shake of $45 an ounce of shake can make a pound of Kenna better but it's gonna be shitty better I mean you're gonna have like you know THC content of like 12% or less than that probably and that's you're gonna have to eat a lot of edibles of things that don't taste very good to get you high I assume it has something to do with with government regulations in California which is why edibles are more in a more efficient way I guess of getting um THC maybe you can sell edibles at a cheaper price even though it contains a comparable amount of cannabis in it that you have to sell at a higher price I don't know it's never made sense to me but yeah so the reason I don't really make edibles is it would be super expensive comparatively because again this has almost a whole this has 2/3 of an ounce of weed in it is what there is what Korova is telling me 2/3 of an ounce of cannabis in here which would cost you you know a hundred and twenty dollars or more easily at a dispensary for you know bottom shelf stuff really yes hopefully that hundred milligram [ __ ] doesn't get passed I have not seen anything else about it it doesn't seem like it's going anywhere so I think we're hopefully all in the clear I don't know I hope so because I would be really really sad if that were the case which would have to get up pack up and move to like Oregon or Washington or something where they want to have that cat speaking of do I have many Oregonians or Washingtonians up in this [ __ ] oh sorry I don't mean to say that word damn it up in this chat room they use trim probably maybe yeah I probably because they've got to make it more economical in some way or they would be going out of business because you can't get 20 grams of weed into a brownie that only costs 40 bucks and not go out of business moon bars are official John blaze welcome back John blaze I am feeling blazed myself guys I am getting super high all good we all thoughts in here that's true we all may be thugs for all also slightly woke thugs and we don't like going around saying that word all the time I didn't mean it derogatory I hope everybody knows that but we all hugs in here so all bone thugs-n-harmony I said worse words than I do unfortunately but we all have row young and we can all forgive each other for our past mistakes that's the you man thanks man thanks dude I appreciate that and I am [ __ ] high already and we're only an hour in okay I have half a brownie to go oh boy oh boy okay so yesterday guys I reviewed the cannabis quench or 200 milligrams that was just sitting right there you can look forward to that coming up on a future of you Oh guys here's a fun thing guess how many reviews I have in the backlog if you had to guess how many reviews I have ready to hit publish on sometimes you might notice like the reviews I'm like oh I'm going to go see guardians of the galaxy too and like June 3rd or something and you're like you're seeing that movie really late well I saw it opening weekend it's because I have a big backlog I would love to try a la famiglia candy bars what hey Jon blades what part of the country are you in if I can if I find those I will give them a try so if you if you are on the west coast if you're in California somewhere let me know about work ethic yes that is one way of describing it Dame is a work ethic or it might be a addiction that might also be a socal okay well then I will keep an eye out for love famiglia candy bars because they just say I'm good yes I am probably I mean I'm certainly psychologically addictive in marijuana who is it who could who could be eating this many edibles every day and not be somewhat psychologically addicted a weed not me that's for sure but uh I can stop any time I want no I really can i I often take small tolerance breaks and things that's work yeah I'd like to me well thanks man I appreciate that but yes I I take lunch breaks every now and then guys I hope everyone does it it saves you some money because if you do edibles every day your tolerance level gets hit pretty hard pretty quickly so always got to take those two drinks speaking of tea breaks it's time to uh not take a tea break and eat a little bit more this brownie here we go another little slice down the hatch it's gonna taste so bad who is scary be dancing I don't know who Gary B is I'm gonna Google in right now oh that is so bad Wow who Gary Vee Gary Vaynerchuk is an American serial entrepreneur wartime New York Times bestselling author speaker and internationally recognized internet personality no he's written hashtag asking Gary one entrepreneur something-something question Jab Jab right hook and then Thank You economy it's always like great books I might have to add them to my um one of those to my own audible cue guys I am I should let you know I'm an audio feed not music I never not have when I'm not doing wheats and even sometimes when I'm doing weights I have now air pods in my ears listening to either podcasts or audiobooks I listen to probably I don't know 40 hours a week of audio content through audiobooks and and podcasts just um two favorites this year I just had this question somebody just asked me what my two favorite audiobooks I listened to this year are here's my answer for you guys totally recommend both of these they will blow your minds you will love them you will love them recommend them to anybody debt the first five thousand years by one the anthropologist David Graeber check that book out debt the first five thousand years it is a history of debt it explains debt it talks about debt talks about what debt is why we have debt what what the meaning of debt is how our whole economy is built on the idea of this abstract notion of such a concept as debt and why we believe in this idea it will change your perspective on economics it is truly a book of big big big ideas I load books that are about big ideas not pops out I mean I'm not talking about your like Malcolm Gladwell [ __ ] or whatever I'm talking like your books like you know your guns germs and steals like that that like come and plop down and say [ __ ] it I'm gonna you know we're gonna challenge the status quo here that's what I like in debt the first 5,000 years I think does that with the field of economics love it read it change your change your perspective on on some things so that's my one of my two favorite audiobooks of the year the second so far is a great course from the great course called the story of human language holy [ __ ] I've always been mildly interest in linguistics never super interested mostly because I think learning foreign languages is hard I think it's very hard but I've been interested in the concept of linguistics and [ __ ] me if that course isn't amazing it's taught by a mic McWhorter I think he's an NYU professor in addition to a bunch of other things and he basically just talks about how language came to be and how languages form and how languages die and how languages continue to evolve and how written languages of the weird thing and and most languages has only ever spoken let me give you an example of this of this amazing amazing amazing anecdote from from one of his lectures where he's talking about how animals different animals have somewhat of the ability to communicate but they don't necessarily have language and he uses this story to illustrate it talking about how there are animals have been known to even express emotional sort of release cathartic release at moments of aesthetic beauty and he talks about this instance where bonobos bonobos which are like chimpanzees basically they're like friendly or like chimpanzees that won't rip your [ __ ] face off and not like to [ __ ] each other all the time so that's what bonobos are but that bonobos will go with their troops and hold hands and watch sunsets together isn't that amazing that bonobos will hold hands and watch the sunset I thought it was incredible [ __ ] loved it that's from the story of human language for a mic McWhorter audiobook from the great course listen to it love it love it love it is even doing it any good we'd audio podcasts out there is anybody are there any good like marijuana dedicated audio podcasts like people who talk about marijuana either from a political ethical perspective maybe even from a business perspective or you know I I don't know I don't know of any good a weed audio out there I'd love to hear some if you guys have any recommendations who getting higher oh I didn't even finish my sliver of writing that I supposed to finish so here we go thanks man interesting stuff bro I know I can talk about why I am talking about audiobooks all day that's what I'm doing right now getting dug with high oh yeah okay yes I have I'm a fan of getting dug with high I have a I used to watch it every episode of the video podcast I haven't watched it recently in like the past year or so but I I had there's some classic episodes like the one where Jack Black basically passes out greens out on camera [ __ ] amazing the one where Pete Holmes basically goes crazy love it yeah getting dug with highs great Joe Rogan I know Joe Rogan talks about weed a lot but I don't listen to mr. Rogan but yes but those are fun miami 7 192 asked what is the most milligrams of edible you've had at once and the answer is 1000 i have done a 1000 of one of these in the past at one time but i passed out in that I mean I passed out I just couldn't review it an hour later I was just too high to get in perfect cameraman talk speak of the multiverse yes yes yes yes somebody finally asked me to speak of the multiverse yes oh and Laurel Lancaster saw the reddit post [ __ ] those virgins um I hope they're not virgins and there they had some good points and unfortunately that video did have terrible audio there are actually three videos coming up that also have terrible audio because I switched to my by of one time and forgot to switch audio outputs and didn't even notice that the audio was terrible because I don't actually even listen to these hey here's a fun behind-the-scenes fact I don't actually listen to these myself I have never watched a week's review all the way through I just edit the beginnings in the middles and the ends and put on the little jibber jabbers and the flippy floppies and send it out there so I am barely conscious with audio [ __ ] up and it [ __ ] up like three reviews so they're gonna be three wishing he reviews and unfortunately that was just the one that got post Cerreta wasn't the shitty in the shitty audio as for my beard you know some people some people just don't like a good beard let's you know come see come saw speak on the multiverse so here we go the multiverse is the greatest thing in science that we don't teach to children because if you if we taught the concept of the multiverse to children children would be much more interested in science and they would be much more they would have a much more attuned sense of curiosity and would just want to question everything more because it's so [ __ ] interesting okay first of all real quick recommendation the greatest book on the multiverse is our mathematical universe by Max tegmark professor at MIT isaac Kozma the cosmology professor at MIT buckin amazing book but let's talk about the multiverse there are actually different levels in the multiverse isn't that incredible so all already were a pretty ridiculous thing so there are several levels of the multiverse the first level of the multiverse is the universe that we live in right now we actually exist in a multiverse in this dimension in this universe in our own little back backyard if if you assume through inflation that our universe is infinite do you think that math is the ultimate reality or describes the ultimate reality that is what the book our mathematical universe is all about max tegmark suggests that math is the ultimate reality that the universe is inherently just a mathematical superstructure as a self-replicating algorithm basically as what he suggests and it's incredible oh my god you've got to read it it's so cool but so our first one with the mother versus if we assume that our universe is a internally inflating moobs you know just outwardly inflating thing and I was gonna say sphere but it's not uniform we know that it inflates at different rates at different spots but that means that that there are technically that space is technically infinite right and with an infinite space that there must be infinite replicas that just we can't ever access them so there might as well be multiverse they might as well be a different universe because we can't ever get to them because they're farther than the speed of light away from us they're you know if some things you know so far from us that it's travelling thanks to the universe expanding if it's at a certain point we can never get to it what's expanding faster than the speed of light away from us because it's expanding at the speed of light plus the university is growing is expanding so there these pockets out there in the universe where there are exact replicas of us because if the universe is infinite there are infinite replicas of everything so I'm having this exact conversation just in some other pocket in some other universe and at some other point somewhere right okay that is University number one that is multiverse number one is our very universe contains its own multiverse because it is inherently or it is theoretically infinite or expands towards the infinity and in an infinite space things must repeat and we must be out there in that infinite expanse over and over and over and over and over again so that's level one of the multiverse in our universe but just inaccessible to us because it is expanding out faster than the speed of light from us that's number one level two is the more common multiverse the one that you sort of think of from like comic books the true multiverse the quantum multiverse which is where basically anytime oh [ __ ] how deep do we definitely go here but okay we're not gonna go super deep down this rabbit hole I don't know man I think the multiverse is that the universe has the capacity configure itself into any configuration and the number of configurations is infinite I that's true well we have no evidence of anything past what we can detect right I mean we unfortunately all we'll ever know is what we can know basically right now we're in an ever-shrinking field of knowledge which is unfortunate way of the way that universe works just because things the fact that it expands everything is getting away from us I accepted everything units in our slot you know like local supercluster or whatever so we'll all constantly have a smaller and smaller pool of data to assess from thinking this is all theoretical so the the second multiverse is just the quantum multiverse just just the quantum multiverse guys no it's the quasi multiverse which just means so every time the wave function which the wave function is every time oh [ __ ] guys we don't need to talk about the wave function this is where we get into like Schrodinger's cat right observation observation if you observe something you collapse the wave function and for something to happen you know is the cat or alive or dead that's not actually true that's what's called the Copenhagen interpretation observation has nothing to do with it it's that the cat is both alive and dead because the cat is alive in one universe and dead in the others and it splits it a process known as decoherence barely how much Brandis left I'd say about a third amateur-hour squared and right now you are here the only thing that you missed is the first level of the multiverse expansion explanation we're currently in the second level in the multiverse explanation we've got the third and most abstract to go so the second one again is all about collapsing of the wavefunction boom collapse you know everything splits and that's what the multiverse that multiverse is is every time that a wavefunction collapses which happens you know constantly trillions and trillions and trillions and trillions or times universes are sort of splintering and splintering and splintering and splintering and splintering so that's level two the most common you know the one that you think of like in comic books what do you think of like how dumb DC Comics are and they have like the multiverse and there's like earth two and r2 19 and all that [ __ ] that's kind of like multiverse two multiverse three is kind of what like gained mr. Singh was suggesting which is is do you think math is ultimate reality or describes ultimate reality mr. Teague Marc suggests that math is the ultimate reality and that our universe is inherently just a mathematical structure meaning it's basically nothing but a self-replicating algorithm that it's a big giant computer program sort of that spits out matter bits us we're just we're just bits basically and our universes is part of a mathematical superstructure uh what about the ether plane I don't know anything about the ether plane what is the ether plane John blaze it might be the fourth level the third liberal mother versus guys I might even be too high to talk about right now at this particular section and I might be too stupid to describe it at any better detail than that I totally suggest you just read our is it our mathematical universe is out it's called hold on let me look at the title max tegmark our mathematical universe yes read it you'll love it it's great brains are computers - yes they are brains are computers they are just computers that use a meat to process instead of transistors spiritual planes were thought and energy travel I don't know about the ether plane oh so math is universe and experienced reality is multiverse oh boy wow that is a poetic way to describe that I would have to be a little bit more sober to parse that out to know if I think that's true but it's on its surface it sounds [ __ ] great dude oh my god so math is the universe an experienced reality as a multiverse Wow even if that turns out not to be true you should definitely get that printed on a t-shirt or a bumper sticker or like a facebook mean or something would you rather have your local WNBA team when the championships this year or receive $5 lol sounds legit oh [ __ ] I don't know who my local nth WNBA team is oh [ __ ] Miami says he would rather receive the $5 I think I would rather take the $5 - to be honest not that I'm disrespecting the WNBA I have no problems with the WNBA I well I'll tell you this I disrespect the WNBA just as much as I disrespect the NBA which is to say I don't really care for either basketball I doesn't do it for me I'm not a sports guy to be honest and perceiver implies separation is the universe separate from itself in any way but illusion the universe is definitely not in any way what you and I perceive it to be it is totally an illusion you know created in the [Music] it's a trick of the brain who knows what objective reality actually looks like if you can even say it has a look you know it doesn't color I mean none of the stuff that that that we're talking about our you can perceive actually exist I mean like color doesn't exist color is a real colors just a it's just a trick I mean everything is it's all our brain just you know cobbling together random sensations and spitting out something that we can grab onto and hope to Christ that are we don't you know die in an existential panic so have you ever had any trouble with the law due to pot I have not hallelujah cross my fingers never had any trouble whatsoever I've never had any trouble with the law period so let alone move pot and I hope to continue that trend for the rest of my life man to be good to spoke with you and crack a cool with you too got some good things too you know later fellas thanks John blaze take care of man yeah I'm gonna miss John blaze he's a good guy alright I gotta do some more brownie here we've been one minute and 17 seconds in it does not very few things I mean taste doesn't exist outside the brain you know getting high doesn't getting exist outside the brain think about what getting high actually is it's [ __ ] crazy it's uh once you start getting all existential it's hard to it's hard to you know sort of right that ship once you start thinking about things it's hard to stop god damn I'm high boom alright here we go [Music] Oh now you're very right amateur hour squared those things definitely do this like taste definitely exists like molecules minute know how to know they don't have consciousness but molecules manipulate our taste buds in particular ways that you know make things like taste but it's it's hard to say what it is what you're just perceiving your brain is telling you something that you oh boy that you think is no you're right I mean I'm just gonna say you're right you're right I'm just gonna concede on that one I'm just gonna concede [ __ ] it [ __ ] it [ __ ] it [ __ ] it [ __ ] it [ __ ] it guys I need more peanut butter M&Ms if you see my gumball machine I don't know if you've been watching the wheats videos where it slowly goes down over time I'm out at peanut butter M&Ms and the sad part is those are super balls but they're too big they don't actually you can't actually get them to come out so they're just there they're just decorative they're aesthetic isn't that shitty for all I know you're in an asylum in Boston pretending to smoke a joint staring in a beard of a bearded man and giggling but my brain says I'm watching this stream you are okay so amateur hour squared let me tell you about my favorite I have actually mentioned this in a stream before because it's my favorite topic of anything to talk about and that is you know if you want to get absurdo add reductive I think yeah about any of these arguments and it's the most convincing argument I think for what the nature of reality is and that's the Boltzmann brain do you guys know what a Boltzmann brain is and that is so like you know you could say oh we're all just in the matrix man you know this that and the other but or we're in a computer simulation you know then the earth is the world is nothing but computer simulation you know and that is likely to be that could very well be true and there's no reason to discount that as a theory as something that's insane there is really no reason that we should be discounting that but that's neither here nor there but what's much more likely is that it's not a computer simulation that you have to you know add in a whole other civilization that is you know managed to harness that level of processing power and basically has constructed a universe similar enough to ours that it would be able to replicate a universe kind of like ours bla bla bla bla bla but that you're a Boltzmann brain and that you are simply a collection of you know like sodium and chlorine atoms that have come together in space somewhere for the briefest of moments you know you've quantumly fluctuated together for just the briefest of seconds to have the consciousness and the memories that you have right now and that you've been weak out of existence completely again so meaning that every memory that you had including me saying that you're nothing but a Boltzmann brain is you having implanted memories from just these atoms that have arranged themselves together in space somewhere which happens if you believe in entropy that's the way it works so then BOOM you're a boat and it comes into existence it says oh I have a mother or father brother sister you know I love to smoke weed I'm smoking weed right now I'm watching this is stupid bearded guy talk about weed when I could be doing nothing more productive and he's also talking about Boltzmann brain isn't that weird books right now existence weight gone and that could be your entire life and isn't that crazy and that is probably what you are you're probably a bold one so yes amateur hour squared you probably are just a a collection of atoms that have flashed into existence because that is the easiest thing to imagine is that you're just you know a couple trillion atoms that have arranged themselves in such a way to give you a random pattern of memories that perceive themselves to be a human being on earth with all these things that you know but really it doesn't take much to arrange that because that all fits inside your brain already and we know that through the laws of entropy anything can just sort of flash into existence if you give it enough time things will just pop in and out of existence give it enough time through the laws of entropy so it's easy to think that your memories your whole personality could just be a random quantum fluctuation why did the universe make me a lonely stoner now that's a great question for an existential crisis that is an excellent existential crisis question anybody else get wrecked on 30 milligrams it's been a while since I could get wrecked on 30 milligrams to be honest Ben I would love to be able to get wrecked on 30 milligrams it takes me to get wrecked to get capital W wreck it's gonna take me about 300 milligrams ten times that unfortunately I've got that high tolerance but maybe if I stopped smoking by two weeks then that 30 milligrams are gonna be wrecked amateur hour squared you're not lonely anymore buddy you've got you've got the you know all the other people in the multiverse thinking about all the other news that are out there think you having this same thought right now just send out some cosmic vibes to them like as John blaze would say get on that 8th or eat there plain son and send some good vibes to them and they'll send good vibes to you and I am high-5 hi did I spell that right hig ehh eh that does spell hi that is correct I am probably 800 milligrams in I would say of this brownie so would be do don't do and guess what it's only been an hour and a half so I have eaten most of it probably in the past half hour too and it takes me about two hours to peak and there's still 200 milligrams left guys she's barely even started to get wacky and it's gonna get I'm gonna get so [ __ ] up it's unbelievable what why am I doing this have I ever seen the performance of just one person at Jim Henson's no but I will look that up right now just one person playing even up and strong enough oh wait that's gonna sound really let me wrap this through my headphones hold on I gotta hear this [ __ ] set as default the vise believes Oh before you knew it someone else would think he can do it I can do it making wow I'm watching it right now it's kind of wonderful kind of sad [Music] Wow this is kind of sad it's kind of a bumming me out but it's beautiful people you can say believe me Jim Henson was a cool dude he was a genuinely good guy he was it like he was like a mr. Rogers level good dude and it seems that in in his death he has continued to inspire many man what a good dude who doesn't like good news by the way I saw spider-man homecoming yesterday anybody seen spider-man homecoming yet I was pleasantly surprised I'd say it's the second best spider-man behind the second spider-man it's the second best spider-man behind spider-man - I would go spider-man to spy spider-man Home Coming spider-man the amazing spider-man the amazing spider-man 2 spider-man 3 that's the spider-man list of spider-man's in my spider-man opinion I also last week in solve the big sick guys which holy [ __ ] is it it's as good as all those reviews obnoxious reviews and like all year you know like woke friends they're like dude you've got to see the big stick you've got to see the big sick it's really good it's really good you've got to see it it's really good well I'm telling you you've got to see the big sick guys it's really good it's really good that's what I'm trying to tell you the big sick give it a watch man oh if you think the Jim Henson thing is heartwarming uh amateur hour squared which it was you got to give the big second chance you got it watch it bro you got watch it bro it's good it'll also warm the cockles of your heart it's great big sick guys if you won't let me give you a number let's see what my number is oh boy oh boy I would say right now I am at a solid 8.0 my cockles I've heard the name but what is it about it is about a man if you've seen a the HIGHlarious HBO program Silicon Valley Dinesh it's it's his true life story of him and his now-wife when he was a stand-up comic in chi-town in Chicago his wife got his then-girlfriend then ex girlfriend gets very very sick and he he goes and romantic things happen and sad things happen and happy things happen and stoner things happen there there's pot in the movie and Ray Romano who [ __ ] I mean like what a great movie there's weed and Ray Romano in one movie [ __ ] it's better than welcome to Mooseport and who would have ever thought a sentence would have been uttered that something is better than welcome to Mooseport because if you ask me welcome to Mooseport is pretty much the best movie ever made I've never seen it but I just imagined when I am 65 and I'm ready to watch a movie like welcome to Mooseport I imagine at that point I'd be like [ __ ] yeah this movie is so good because I assumed nobody who's less than 48 has ever seen welcome to Mooseport do I listen to run the jewels uh no I one time was a college DJ when I was in like grad school and we played a lot of run the jewels but I not a big run the jewels I'm not a big music guy to be honest I have very bad taste in music I have like listened to like one album obsessively for a year at a time currently I'm listening to Jason is both the Nashville sound over and over and over and over but most of us into podcasts and audiobooks oh [ __ ] Black Panther I saw a baby driver I just a baby driving was amazing I didn't know they had done the music before I had done some music for it yeah I know of them and they're super cool it's just I don't have good taste in music unfortunately I have shitty taste in music as I said I most of those in audiobooks and podcasts when I do listen to music it's like again I listen like one album all year long because I'm boring and that right now is Jason is Paul in the Nashville sound Jason is born the Nashville sound available on Apple music and spotify right now on all streaming platforms and maybe tidal who knows who the [ __ ] actually subscribes to title check it out Jason's bone the Nashville sound that's Jason is born the Nashville sound hey Jason if there any if anybody out there knows Jason is bull dumb I'm Finn that's Jason there's born the Nashville sound it's available in all streaming platforms right now except title I don't know who the [ __ ] knows anything about title I don't and I am hi actually I don't even know anything about Spotify I don't have Spotify I have Apple music [ __ ] Spotify you know actually I think Spotify is probably better I just get Apple music because they have that family put they got that family playing for that good price so I just do that and you can find like Apple you can find iTunes gift cards for 20% off all the time so it's really cheap that's why you gave Apple music in case you guys were wondering you probably weren't but because I'm super high I could tell you about my opinions about Apple music V Spotify and my opinion is I don't give a [ __ ] you go with whatever one you like just not title well actually you can do title two because I don't know I think that title the other thing I'm going to know about title is that it's supposed to be the butt of all Apple are all streaming music jokes so if if I'm gonna make a joke about streaming music title needs to be the punchline and I also know oh not much else right now so this shirt guys that has pineapples and with sunglasses on it I found that Marshalls for $12 what a deal what the table oh what a world we live in and I notice nobody and I'm too dumb Minh know how mears work what's my favorite cannabis musician Willie Nelson the OG cannabis musician actually I don't know my hair has a braid in it right now - this was for reddit its Braden Sean like grooming techniques my partner did it oh boy what who is Marshalls and TJ Maxx and Ross piece hell yeah actually a new one just moved into Long Beach that's like a more it's like Ross if Ross was in Baghdad Iraq it's called Dedes discounts one just open up in Long Beach it mostly just had like empty racks and abandoned small children and discount underwear but I assume at one point I had great deals on great clothing but I don't normally don't go to Marshalls TVJ Maxx or Ross but I needed some cheap dog beds and that's the best ways that's the best place to go for dog beds that is a pro tip Oh one out of drink how much must have finish this without drink I might have to leave for a second agreed something those two drink I'm getting so high guys I am getting really crazy hi-yah it's is unbelievable Korova if you're out there you make really strong potent products this is this is this is really it's really amazing what you're doing to me right now you're really doing wonderful things for the planet persevere persevere persevere maybe maybe cannabis lean this is Europe teachers I have tried one cannabis syrup that is a review that will be coming up I tried one called Sivir or something can't no cannabis cannabis I did try a cannabis I won't spoil the review but that will be coming up in my 25 or so backlog reviews that somebody out of 9 yet clips I would say an 8 5 8 5 and rising 8 5 and this roller coaster is at a 90 degree angle baby we are going straight up and I have no idea what happens when I get to the apex when I'm looking down at is it a 90 degree drop or is it gonna be one of those ones with like the nice corkscrew bends where you kind of get let down gently because if it's one of those ones like the Hulk and Universal Studios where you go straight up and then just like well we could all be in trouble we get all being tripled that's the case nice that was the name of your service lack of Asst slacked Ennis buckle up what was your old bad habit if you don't mind sharing I probably could have plot pick up on your innuendo if I were more sober but I'm not and I can't pick up on you pretty much any innuendo right now so if you're willing to divulge I'm willing to listen this has been dr. Frasier Crane on you something something Seattle something something Frasier Crane is the adil Seattle I never thought in my entire life guys I would be at a point where I would be on a microphone on the internet getting high talking about the experience isn't that a crazy world we live in that's a crazy world that is a really crazy we live in a crazy world we do it's crazy do you guys twitch or is YouTube the place to be for streaming I don't know like when I'm doing my live stuff should I be on YouTube or should it be on Twitch and then should I just put the video on YouTube I don't know I don't know anything I'm not this I'm not a social media guru even though I went to J school I did not focus on the social media outside of J school that's what we call it J school baby J school so yes I even though I went to J school you think I would know about good social media habits and I did actually take a class on medical writing for the internet which talked about how to you know some good social media practices but I don't really remember it it wasn't my favorite class to be tbh I you say you - I'd say YouTube you say YouTube hey Dawg hey my dogs here that's snart otherwise known as news she's a good dog you'd like her no maybe not she's kind of actually an [ __ ] to some people if she doesn't know you she can be a real [ __ ] there she's coming in right now because it's time delay I am high-5 I'm obeying so spelling that correctly I think I am I think I am I think I am should I play a video game and stream it right now is that what that's what cool kids do how do I do that let's see plus if I went to output sources Game Capture auto-detect by shrunk this down let's experiment together whoop outputs sources I kinda wanna play my favorite video game of all time in from you guys well none of all time but my favorite video game that I'm playing right now and the game that I could just talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talking about come knocking knocking knocking talking talking talking about it's a game that everybody should be playing because it often goes on steam sales for super cheap it's a little game called off world trading company now if I could hear you guys I'd love to be hearing the clickety clacks your keyboards as you go to Metacritic and go what is this game you are talking about off world trading company I've never heard of such a thing off to Metacritic I go so that's what you should be doing right now and you will then see that it has a surprisingly low Metacritic of 78% even though it is a wonderful wonderful game ah see somebody give it a hundred Oh men what are these dumb reviews here let's listen to the quarter than threes review quarter two three great publication by the way I'll make my picture bigger while I wait to decide what we're doing there you go we're bigger again quarter no three says it is every bit as thrilling as something with constant explosions it's the sort of game you'll be thinking about at work it's the sort of game you might want to try online it's the sort of game with a campaign you can play and replay and replay some more it's the sort of game with so many settings and options and variables that you might never need another R T s doesn't that sound wonderful but the most important thing about it is don't ignore the options bells and whistles and doodads it is that that fundamental game play son it is that cord painfully that is so so so so so tight oh it's like it's like if you took an Excel spreadsheet stuck in a blender ground that spreadsheet down in its barest essentials and said you play the [ __ ] son that is what off world training company is and it is amazing is the best spreadsheet simulator you've ever seen in your life you buy low you sell high you work the markets you sabotage that [ __ ] you get all them resources you corner that market you oh boy you're your opponent need us needs a your opponent needs a water too bad you got all the claims son you need water you're gonna have to buy it from the market you're going to buy it from me son you're gonna have to buy it from me now oh my god off world trading company it's so incredible play in a million times a day love it love it love it love it sage is in the house welcome sage we're just talking about off world trading company in that I might have to try straining it cuz I'm gonna have to do something to try to stay away cuz I'm about to pass out you come in Sage at the moment where it's like oh god is he gonna make it is he gonna make it so maybe what I'm gonna have to do is shrink from the skull down get to some offworld play it I'll let you guys say like Oh God look how good this game is you need to get it so we can all play on Steam together and say hallelujah and happen and talk about the markets and all that fun stuff I do I don't use it but I do have a twitch I think it's just wheat but I could do it on YouTube too I think I think let me try something right now let's go to Steve library off-world trading company you've got to give this game a try guys go ahead go ahead and go ahead and straight up get up and leave my channel leave me go watch some offload trading company videos right now like I'm [ __ ] I suck what you need to be doing is watching YouTube use a lot for oil trading company and then playing with me online because it's incredible and you guys if you have that part of your brain that likes these kind of games like this kind of experience like a heart just like getting your gut punched with numbers crunchy numbers and just formulas and Oh economic simulator goodness then this is for you if however you like fun and enjoyable things and having a good time and just enjoying yourself and just lovin life and you know having a good time playing a video game and just just just generally just you know just being a just being a good guy and having a good times I would not get off road training company because it's it'll corrupt you it's it's not fun oh that sucks age are you stage you don't tell me specifically but what part of California UN or Northern California Southern California at their party's central California because Korea I know in my sort of area if one dispensary doesn't have it you can usually hop to another and find it so I just wonder if it's more sparsely dispersed where you're at so opera trading company again it is not a game you should play if you like to enjoy video games it's a game to play if you are sort of a sadist okay so alt-tab oh boy there I ain't there it is [Music] [Music] okay okay we're sort of Orange County here in the southern Orange County okay yeah that's unfortunate that wouldn't be delivered there cuz I'm I guess I'm more southern LA County northern Orange County and and it seems to be pretty pretty widely dispersed up here but hopefully it's just a it's just a temporary dry spell and you're gonna get your Korova sent to you soon but if you sage if you haven't if your dispensaries or out of kirova and they happen at canna co if can I could try but I know Kentico is much much less widely dispersed demand kirova I have only ever seen it at two dispensaries I think out of you know like many so unfortunately it's not as widely dispersed as I would like but if you if you even have the opportunity to ask your dispensary if like if they ever like uh what products you like tell them to recommend Kanak oh man because I hate to sound like a show I wish I were showing for them catechu if you want to pay me money to tell people that your products are awesome wheats reviews at gmail.com I'll do it I you know with ethic ethically of course I'll tell people and I'll bet I'll be happy to show for you but I'm happy to show for for them for free for now because their products are that good but done yeah tell you or tell your dispensary like hey guys get some Kanaka products because they deserve the exposure I can't go if you're out there because I know you've been out there before keep up the good work sorry to sound like a shill again okay off world trading company let's just do a single-player let's just do a skirmish boy I can't play this I can't talk about this game right now I'd be [ __ ] crazy dog maybe later because I'm just too high I did try to explain that [ __ ] whoo boof that'd be so crazy happy crazy nuts look how red my eyes are getting oh my god I am getting high and if you have okay keep me focused I got to keep focus to keep focus keep focus keep focus what what uh what what can i play instead what did the kids like they like overwatch right overwatch um so I oh [ __ ] I have overwatch I suck at it I was good I was okay on console but I suck at PC version but I have it I can play overwatch oh god I just have to stay focused I did say I'll probably die so I've got to stay here and I might die guns guns you want a game with guns guns guns guns guns guns guns guns guns okay I can play some overwatch sorry sorry amateur hours squared I'm back I'm focused on focus focus somebody said something about guns that's all I that's the last thing I remember somebody said something about guns smoked a bowl for me man please it'll keep me keep me on the straight and narrow a blizzard app I hope my PC can handle all this action I've got a good I've got a 1070 GPU and my CPU while a little bit older was nice for 2000 what but let me see if I can find out my emphasis alright guys because no one asked I have 16 gigs of RAM an i7 48 23.7 not overclocked even though I could but I won't because I don't know how and I don't care to find out how for now running Windows 10 and I have a 1070 GPU so there you go now you know but my xsplit just said I was experiencing high CPU usage and it also said you suck which I thought was harsh but who knows why it said then maybe maybe it's just uh how much do I have left to eat how much would you estimate Oh let's pull up this camera I need a pump exploit here I would say I have eaten 80% 4/5 if we want to get L least common denominator about it the least common denominator that's not what that means boom overwatch trying to do this trying to do this people like it but it says pause progress will be saved if you exit what's paused you think that's a quarter left Miami Oh God a quarter well I guess that's not a whole lot more than 20% but it sounds a lot worse than I have to eat five percent more than I thought before oh [ __ ] I will eat at all I'm gonna have to get something else to drink at some point so I'll have to like leave the mic for a little bit but I won't end the stream the stream will keep running you'll just have to look at my I believe somebody said Isis ish background which I also thought was a little harsh if a little funny I also think it was a comment on my beard if a little harsh but also a little funny a little uncomfortable in terms of racial politics but still pretty funny I guess but yeah i'ma need some more of that brownies pretty scary to our quarter life because yes I'm officially out of nine I am definitely at a nine already and there's a quarter left and we're only an hour and 55 minutes in whoops let's see wait if the dog would stay I would try it but I don't think that dogs gonna stay the doc said dick not to be shut up I suck I am high off to get something to drink and I'm gonna finish this in just a moment one second let me play play the jeopardy music wangan [Music] oh my god guys now you get to know the embarrassing truth that I was wearing gym shorts the entire time I'm often wearing gym shorts which is really embarrassing to admit out loud better than sweatpants bet that matter better than sweatpants I guess and only because it's hot because if it was cold my probably wearing sweatpants underneath but don't tell anybody that don't tell anybody that don't tell anybody [Music] man I just noticed upon leaving here and speaking to someone else how hoarse my voice had already gotten two hours of straight speaking has done a lot to my voice apparently if I fail out it might actually be for that reason and who knows give them give up on life pants yes somebody understands the true nature of sweatpants that they are give up on life pants but you can only wear my give up on life pants whereas woman I swear I hear traffic coming to this Mike it's Mike getting really sensitive no I'm super sensitive about audio I'm just so sensitive because like those guys were really harsh me really mean that's okay there's nothing wrong with being mean there we go that sounds better I think does that sound better oh all right I've got a half a bottle of diet Snapple peach flavored in some of this brownie left all right here we go ooh Oh my dog's back she just let herself in she's read like that and she just let herself out what a not gonna say it I'm not gonna say I'm not gonna say okay um that was about half of that so I've got about half left to go I'll do that in just a little bit I'm gonna see what's going on with this overwatch game that keeps telling me it's can't load let's try try again who can't get that taste out of my mouth I might have to put up I might give up on life pants because I love that phrase now was that taking from somewhere amateur hours squared give up on my pants I feel like I've heard that phrase somewhere not to suggest that you wouldn't be clever enough to come up with something as good as that but I feel like I've heard that somewhere what the H over watch why are we waiting ah Adventure Time adventure time yes that sounds right oh now ever watch doing something it's de l'ann\u00e9e initializing um what else do we have to talk about we can talk about we've talked about the multiverse already we're talking about Boltzmann brains we could talk about go check it out can I co oh we could talk about a venture time I've seen like the first three seasons of the show and it is remarkable that that is a show for children that that show is primarily targeted at children aliens aliens we can talk about aliens we can talk about aliens we can talk about aliens we can talk about why why why they're the Fermi paradox the kind of scary Fermi paradox which is why haven't a lien x' contacted us or why haven't we found aliens why I mean where don't we know about them because it seems like we should theoretically right because if the universe is as old as we think it is well you know we're still sort of in a young period of the universe you know relatively speaking we're actually a very young period of the universe but it's been around long enough certainly long enough billions of years long enough actually for other intelligent life to have formed in different places in the universe and theoretically if it were possible for that life to come up with some sort of you know interstellar travel what we should have seen them because enough time has passed and enough that there should be enough civilization or enough interstellar aliens out there you know to visit all kinds of periods or spots in the universe because it's theoretically they would be abundant enough because the Milky Way is just that big there are that many stars and we know that now especially that stars tons of stars have habitable planets on them so but why isn't there life out there everywhere what's causing it what's causing life not to be sort of you know abundant in the universe or intelligent life it's kind of a scary thing and there are a couple of big theories as to why that is either they are smart enough to stay away or too dumb to make contact it's the latter that I would be most afraid of the most scary I think the most scarier alternative is that it's just not possible that interstellar becoming like an interstellar species is it's beyond the laws of physics meaning no civilization no matter how intelligent can do it no matter how much planning is involved no matter how good you are it's gonna it's impossible to travel amongst stars in any real way because the limits of physics prevent it from happening that's really scary to think about that's really scary to think about because it just basically means you know we're all everybody's doomed no matter what you know because your stars gonna explode at some point and you're never gonna get out from where you're at so it's a really scary prospect I think - one to suggest if that's why now some of the other ones are basically just that it's sort of like a Star Trek ian prime directive thing right like there are aliens out there but they just don't come into contact with sort of primitive ish aliens until they hit some kind of technological breakthrough and then you know then then you're invited into whatever sort of you know larger Federation or whatever that seems far-fetched to me but who knows maybe there's also the predatory idea what if we're the first yes but it doesn't really make sense for us to be the first Miami that's the problem it's because though it's more than enough time has passed and in conditions would have been more than ripe enough in millions of places in the Milky Way for this exact scenario to have already arisen but seemingly hasn't or we so it just doesn't make sense for us to be the first the chances of us being the first are so so low because the conditions for you know this to have happened would have happened millions if not billions of times already in the Milky Way so it's just like it doesn't seem like we would be the first back with back woods welcome back Dan you know saying I am a lot higher than the last time you saw me here is how much brownie I left right now not a lot I'm and my voice is starting to give after two hours and six minutes my voice is slowly starting to say you screw you buddy screw you for doing this you stupid son-of-a-bitch so Miami to answer your question I don't know it's possible that were the first it is possible but it's very very unlikely and it makes oh nice dude nice gonna have some fun dancing boy sorry I don't know I make dumb noises like that arbitrarily I'm really high as you can tell I'm starting to ramble I mean I've been rambling for a while I'm glad somebody asked me about aliens I can continue to talk about aliens I like why do all aliens in media look like humans you know they're probably if aliens exist they wouldn't look anything like us I mean aliens would keep saying aliens aliens aliens I think what we mean is obviously when we say aliens is intelligent life because I think aliens if but just by the definition aliens like you know life I think we're gonna find that's pretty abundant actually I think we'll probably find life on Mars meaning microbial life at some point or evidence there of that there was microbial life at some point it just seems like life is at least on at least according to the conditions here on earth or the way earth works life is a pretty tenacious thing it seems to want to form I know Mars is very different than than Earth but it wouldn't surprise me if if somewhere we didn't find some microbial life on Mars at some point but but intelligent life is a whole other matter I mean it could be it could very well be true that and this is another theory for the Drake Equation that that we are sort of the first but first and only that we are such in a freakish anomaly like it seems unlikely but it could be true that that humans really are that rare that humans are really that sort of special it would be very scary because it would suggest how utterly precious intelligent life is and you know we're about to destroy it or about to it you know and and that grand experiment I I think here on earth before too much longer if we continue of course but what we don't yet we definitely don't hope that humans that intelligent life is incredibly rare but currently the evidence sort of suggests that intelligent life is insanely insanely insanely rare which is very scary because it means it's utterly precious and I don't think we treat it as such here on earth which is unfortunate very very unfortunate um who would I send bacteria to an earth-like planet would I geo populate when I geo spore a planet of course I'm sure I'd love to it yeah if there was if there was an earth-like planet out there that had oceans and tress you know both oceans and liquid water and terrestrial well just if there's a planet out there that had liquid water simply liquid water whatever and you know in whatever way even no matter what the atmosphere was as long as there was liquid water there you know h2o I would germinate that planet in a second with human bacteria because why the hell not what do you I guess I know that and you know an ethicist might scold me for my calves awareness for how easily I say like oh yeah why the [ __ ] not because I know there are some ethical implications for for doing something like that but it seems to me like you do everything you can that that life is the goal that life is is a good thing and it should be encouraged life should be encouraged when it doesn't you know crowd out other wife or when it doesn't affect you know but but when if a place is sterile yeah I can't I couldn't fathom a reason why not so pangenesis theory meaning that the earth is populated by has been populated by bacteria from an asteroid I don't see why not I mean that's it's just as likely as anything else if that's what you mean I I would I could totally believe they were just bacterial hitchhikers from an asteroid you know that's or you know tardigrades or whatever not even bacteria we could have been more involved in that but that sounds totally valid to me it doesn't obviously doesn't solve the problem of where life comes from it just solves the problem from where life comes from on earth which to me you know it seems like we're gonna get pretty close to that in a lab pretty soon you know we can do it with like proteins and amino acids and things and it seems like you know it's not gonna be too much longer before we can I know that that sounds grandiose that sounds like a bigger claim them than I know that that can be made but but I want to be surprised oh my god my voice is really starting the goo yes it does it does it does oral Lancaster it's not because it's not because I am speaking or getting more high it's just because my voice is it's going out I've just been talking for so long it's been a while since I've it's going Betty it's going I'm I've got an oddly sort of sedate not oddly sedate of course you get to date but my answers to questions have been less have been more sort of [ __ ] I can't think of a good word for it I've been far more serious have been far more sort of senatorial I've been then they have been sort of fun I don't know I am so high our computers or animals intelligent life that is an incredible question it's obviously a semantic question which does not in any way imply it's a bad question no not at all I would say that [ __ ] I don't know I think we'll find out with computers soon pretty soon probably computers do all kinds of crazy things already we're we're probably not far off from singularity like event I would think I I hate to give a curt spot while or however you says last name credit but it seems like the pace of AI growth in the past like two years has been [ __ ] nuts and it is nothing but an exponential growth and what we're already doing is kind of crazy or monkeys kicking in you [ __ ] I know it's just rude but that's good awesome good [ __ ] in California my homeland dog it is only two regular Cheetos out here holy [ __ ] these are hotter than I thought they're gonna be who I'm gonna start sweating oh god I better stop what a mercy I'm a sweater okay oral Lancaster hey I have a confession in this story time Please Please Please Please Please Please Please Please Please Please Please Please Please Please Please Please Please Please do not think of me in a bad way in any way shape or form one time the dog you saw right there did get high accidentally she's um 99.99% of the time super good with like food doesn't go after it or anything boy this flamin hot cheetos still hot ooh I thought I liked him Wow gonna have to have some peanut butter M&Ms so what time I hadn't an apple and they left it on the coffee table like the last third of 150ml grandma and it was a cookie and she got it oh no it was less than it was it was she got maybe 20 milligrams total of THC but it was it was enough to make her very high she was very high I felt very very guilty I felt incredibly incredibly guilty when it happened she seemed not to mind too much she drooled a lot she drilled a hell of a lot she's mostly pretty sleepy her eyes were like this then she would sleep then she would get up for a while and kind of like one I'm sort of won our belly rub but not really and it lasted about six hours so yeah I got I got her high ones accidentally please don't judge me I felt terrible it definitely doesn't mean to do it peanut butter M&M mr. cool me down I have never heard that before dancing that is a fun factoid I did not know that there was any anthropods anthropological evidence that dogs were domesticated with cannabis Oh to do some googling later check out some science journals 250 milligrams oh my god Wow how how big is your dog or a lancaster Tony like pounds is your dog well that doesn't surprise me we we've done a lot of things to dogs over the centuries that's why they are the way that they are we've done a lot of cool things but have it's resulted in dogs being the sort of awesome creatures that they are sorry PETA don't judge me for that comment PETA oh it's a little dog too oh [ __ ] I'm sorry buddy hey oral Lancaster do you ever take your dog to Rosie's the dog beach I know it's crazy like that dogs get like benzos and [ __ ] now it's nuts I think pets a dog and cat thanks to Millennials reticence to have children we're spending a lot of money on pets Millennials are and I think you know 20 years now we're going to look back and be like oh my god you're like we are giving dogs you know pills for anxiety and selling them shirts that were supposedly keeping them calm during thunderstorms and blah blah blah lime and realizing how many of these things are just utter scams and just you know complete [ __ ] but who knows right now we're in the bubble oh cool dude yeah I go to Rosie's like I don't know probably 10 times a week or something I've got three dogs got to keep them busy I assume the answer is yes Miami but iose it doesn't really matter because you are the one that can come you're a hundred percent in control of the supply they don't even understand what supply is so they can become addicted and instantly may even kill them that way by with make him go through withdrawals but yeah they can become addicted to like cocaine and I know cocaine I assume opiates - I don't know though because they do all kinds of addiction experiments on different animals including dogs and they get them addicted to substances including squirrels I've heard in from a study I think can get so addicted to cocaine that they will starve themselves to death basically like if you give them a water bottle with a cocaine drip in it they will drink from that like water bottle basically instead of eating even it's so addictive to them that they will just continue to consume the cocaine and forgo eating completely and will eventually even start themselves to death that's how like powerful those substance abuse can be in them or so addiction can be you know humans can control that but but yeah so substance abuse can definitely develop and dogs have I ever popped a SAN no I have never done pills the only other drug I've ever done is mushrooms and I've I think I've told this story once I did it like actually just a couple months ago and did not really get high I just felt my senses slightly heightened I just had I think it was Dana told me that's sort of the optimal first experience but but yeah that was my first and only experience with any other drug I'm not necessary I'm not opposed to other drugs it's just I've always found weed to be more than more than sufficient so far when it comes to intoxicants and I don't need to get addicted to anything else right OS people are M&Ms are delicious that was what was in that other half of that gumball machine notice they're like six left I also have no idea how much money's in there cuz I really did put quarters in there and I haven't taken them out yet no cool how much you know I'm just gonna wait til I can't put any more quarters in I totally agree with that sentiment Dane that is the proper way to think about it I hoped I had gone in prepared for an intense experience but did not get it my first time if the opportunity presents itself to do it again I would not what hesitate a second to do it but the opportunity has just not I haven't really sought it out but it just hasn't come along since but if it does so I'll do it for sure that's the only other drug I feel like I need to do and I'm just I have an intense curiosity about mushrooms just because I've heard that it can do sort of wonderful things sort of wonderful therapeutic things in oral Lancaster I could not even begin to imagine eating a thousand milligrams Kentico and then taking acid oh my god it would be like me trying to come up with a metaphor right now there'd be a difficult for how crazy it would be I'm not sure what I meant by what I just said but oh hi I'm at like a ten yeah like right there I'm definitely feeling it now in the body as well is the head I feel like I guess I am having not the time skipping thing I was talking about earlier but this sort of time sort of slowed down it doesn't I feel sort of separated from from normal normal time it's crazy that holy-shit Joey Diaz two thousand milligrams of edibles he's a large gentleman though right I think so that that to me makes sense that he would he could eat that much but that's still in an insane ight well no even he's look that's two thousand milligrams I mean it would bankrupt you if nothing else II I know he's a wealthy guy but that's like a hundred but 100 by 100 bucks a day yo well he's wealthy guy you can afford that one mine to put the [ __ ] my talking about people Bob doesn't know our day drug habits easy fun Wow what hit harder for you this or they can't go 500 milligrams right now the Kanaka is still winning in terms of the 500 milligrams but I have not yet finished this and I am not yet anywhere near peak I assume it's going to be a close race I don't know for sure I've got one more bite of this to go I'm gonna have to get another drink because I'd pretty much finish this one because this thing is gross and it's getting grosser by the second so I assume by the end it's gonna be a pretty close race what is cactus juice is that a is it a syrup 200 I'm still I'm still blown away by 2,000 milligrams of edibles but yes I've seen Joey Diaz several times on the we talked about it earlier the aforementioned what do you call what what do you put that thing that we call it that we talked about getting dug with high that's right yes said it right by saying it wrong yes yes Wow yeah oh it's mescaline Oh mescaline okay I've never done it I think I would be down I think I wouldn't be down for ayahuasca to possibly I don't know basically anything that can have that has like some sort of therapeutic benefits I would I would be willing to try I wouldn't do anything no opiates ever I want to do any sort of cocaine or any of its derivation 'he's no pills no but mostly I would try I think I would try acid for sure in shrooms which I've done once to no effect really I have heard ayahuasca is gross - I heard you pretty much definitely throw up isn't that the case with ayahuasca that you will throw up that you have to have somebody there who's trained and basically prepares you to yak everywhere and then you're sort of okay just eat rooms in chocolate yeah I'd be happy to just got to find somebody who can deliver the the the goods so Dana have you had have you had troops before I mean I trims have you had ayahuasca before is it and if you have is it quite as intense as I've heard or as sort of revelatory I I'm not sure if you're just knowledgeable or if you are also experienced in these in these drugs the purge oh I said throwing them not the what well not the film trilogy is it a trilogy r--'s well they're just two of them I think I don't know I can't keep straight I think the three purchase and then a great Rick and Morty spoof is good always get that stuck in my head I hope I didn't get those good stuck in your head from Rick and Morty the purge spoof episode when they keep flashing to the whatever Bard is that the purge the bar that makes you purge better or whatever yeah the Virgin experience is mind boggling but after you get the message it's just a nauseating who nas eating sounds terrible 100 cups or so wow that is crazy that is so crazy well guys I am sorry if I am a little slow in the draw here I am intensely intensely intensely it's it's it's sitting in really hard two and a half hours though halfway the more you know rainbow voodoo - because the purge comes from a particular chemical the use of egg whites I wonder how AG whites removes the chemical oh cool you know you're [ __ ] man you really you're a you're quite intelligent about your your drugs you're quite knowledgeable I am I am NOT I am my my my my knowledge lie lie lie or lay one of the two elsewhere see not even it's definitely not grammar about time to finish what left yeah it is guys I might have to leave for two more seconds to go get another beverage and then we'll finish what's left yes okay proteins capture the Tanis the more you know again all right I will go get a another beverage and we will finish this last bit of brownie no I'll just deal with what I've got here folks live I could not agree more Oh Thank You Miami thank you oh that was so gross well peanut butter mmm skip that empty that taste out my mouth ah Dane that is amazing that is so cool um Wow uh if I were still a science writer I would totally love to interview you and write something about you but I don't do that anymore Wow how many states Dane even allow a psychedelic therapist license I assume like two three well men all 100% listen I'll add it to the queue oh I would oh just okay that makes sense there's a singular thing I thought maybe maybe Washington or Oregon but but just California is good enough but that's a wonderful thing that California does III's again I think these kind of uses and the sort of research on this stuff is so so promising encouraging and so helpful to people California Institute oh man I don't even know what CI is is I know the California Institute of Technology but I don't what is them well let me do some googling I've got a computer that's what I'm doing is computing right now I've got a Googler right here ci is the California Institute of integral studies founded in 1968 oh how am I how cool how super cool masters of arts PhD side II Wow I had no idea I had no freaking idea oh okay there are two different ones I was like I was confused there are two CI is wait guys I'm having trouble even navigating my tabs believe it or not Wow Wow as a prescription for depression treatment because that would be wonderful is there are certainly people out there that are resistant to your SSRIs and whatever our older antidepressants are out there and could really use some new treatments that would be really really really cool if MDMA were a prescription for oh so they would be given MDMA and then how would they be like exposed like with this before veterans or or people who are just like any kind of sort of traumatic events and then they try to like replicate whatever the trauma is is that is that what the dye I guess I don't know maybe I'm confused about what exposure therapy is I thought it was like where you sort of expose somebody to what they're traumatized for by or by in order to get them to sort of overcome their let me see exposure therapy oh yeah yeah yeah so you give people MDMA and then have them encounter their feared object whatever without that's cool is that as that how that would work is that you would basically have them do exposure therapy while on MDMA with the idea that MDMA would relax them even further turtle 88 I don't know to be honest I actually don't know what I their this words mean unfortunately if I'm being honest 14 billion dollars a year to PTSD holy [ __ ] is that just like in medical costs or god forbid is that like in also does that include like the cost of their suicides and how that costs affects the economy is that true psilocybin has a high chance of making it worse so if you do expose your therapy with on mushrooms if you're doing the exposure therapy while on mushrooms you could get your symptoms might become worse oh that's that sucks I had no idea I thought I thought psilocybin mushrooms were supposed to be pretty helpful in that case I had always heard it was good for trauma or dealing with trauma but I guess that's a different thing exposure therapy and dealing with trauma are not necessarily mutually exclusive 95% effective holy [ __ ] that's about as good of a result as you can hope for how fortuitous by the way that we had a PTSD and hallucinogenics and expert about treatment resistant depression had to scroll back up to find out the exact title my voice is really starting to go wow I can barely hear myself talk at this point that is true turtle 88 I just did it with several people exact same amount the other two people had a much more intense reaction than I did my reaction was rather tepid in fact it wasn't bad it was just less than I thought it would be Wow Wow a fully 130 people have bad trips in the therapeutic dose and that is referring to psilocybin mushrooms and bad trips are entirely self-reported obviously right like somebody just says like what happened to me was entirely unpleasant and then that is considered a bad trip what if somebody says like oh man it was so weird like you know I don't know I can't say I didn't like it but it was so strange you know like how do you quantify trips is it is it just good and bad or is it a spectrum you can quote that [ __ ] pretty well that clinical literature you have quite the memory for it I'm sorry I'm growing you're so intensely but it's so interesting it's so fascinating I was just I was talking about this before I had any idea what I was speaking to an expert III think it's so fascinating it's really quite cool I am sorry that my voice is going and I am sorry that I am getting even more boring than I was before because my mind is also starting to get quite foggy I'm I would say you're quite immersed in a Dane anybody going for that PhD pretty much has to I am awesomely ripped that's an apt description a very apt description I'm approaching about as high as I've been the only thing that is preventing me from like just curling up and watching Netflix at this particular moment is is my pledge am I ever going to review cushy punch I reviewed one cushy punch turtle 88 just one I found it immensely unsatisfying unfortunately because I think they're quite expensive i will review more because there people have told me that they are sort of inconsistent in potency and i would like to give them a second chance because i'm only give them the one chance so I will review could you punch again but I have reviewed them once before I think if you look somewhere in my upload history you can find it it's closer to the beginning but I have reading them once and did not really like it unfortunately oh wow that would be incredible Oh Miami no I can still do a game stream I I just lost track of everything and believe it can you believe that that I would have lost track of stuff what I was pointing on doing boy I'm just going through all my different tabs that I had opened since starting the stream Gary Vaynerchuk grams in an ounce fear of milk lacked a phobia I am very high game straight game stream overwatch let's see sources they did since that our tree post it was a pretty remarkable thing it was a very nice experience I was with feedback damn you overwatch damn you I gotta close it that bad overwatch I I'm too high to deal with this audio producers not here deal with it either it's just me working overtime producer was like um nope nope I was like I understand I was also like you know it exists and they were like hey I'm your ed and I was all like [ __ ] you I have no idea what I'm talking about yeah producers not here nor does the producer exist if a producer did exist I would not allow pretty sure to be here for this because it would be really boring but there is no producer on weeds maybe there is the behind the scenes of wheats is an interesting shop well I'm glad you found us Miami I'm glad you forgave us for our shitty audio quality on that first video it was an unfortunate video to have posted to our slash trees but you know I'm still glad that it was it was posted I'm really appreciative for everyone that that watched and I'm really appreciative for all the people who gave me tips about how to trim my beard or how to make my videos look like Isis recruitment videos I really appreciate those those comments as well they were they made me they made me giggle because like my beard is big it made me laugh well yes so Miami thank you so much this video was for you is for you because it's still happening somehow it is still happening I'm crazy hi um okay overwatch seemed like it was gonna screw up my audio so that's out I could still try a off-road trading company aka the best video game you've never heard of that somehow only has a 78 on Metacritic even though it deserves like you know a 91 to be really granular about it did say like gonna get really bad and I can just go I don't really understand the the the ten scale that Metacritic has decided to use or the one scale rather sorry it does what's the difference between 92 to 93 I know that's um I know that's a criticism often long but I actually like Metacritic I'm not a Metacritic ater screw the meditators not don't screw anybody everybody should have internal opinions a lot of Western diets contradict dangerously with ayahuasca my diet is very can be described as quite Western yes quite quite Western in fact well I'm glad you find your own animals to be consistent how many how many grams of weed do you think you use in your average edible would you say Dane are using a gram per edible or something more or less significant and are you using high-grade bud or using like shake or something shake shake shake I might have to go get another beverage and I might have turned this AC back on because it's getting warm need the caffeine guys we might have to play that jeopardy music for you again I'll be right back I'll be right back I'll be right back all right I should have turned the AC off while I left I apologize but I am back oh boy it has been nearly three hours now it has been two hours and like 45 minutes maybe two and a half hours since I finished the edible completely the last little bit of it so I'm not at peak high yet for sure two dogs and now joining the party so I anticipate getting even hired I'm sorry that my range of topics has seemed to have shrunk my brainpower is less boy oh boy is is less substantial than once wise not to say that it never had any real oomph but but yeah it definitely has less than it did before I am exceptionally exceptionally high right now I my voice is giving out this might be the only time I have talked for three hours straight in my life not that I've talked exactly straight I there's some gaps here and there so this this is this is more taxing on my voice than I would have thought but I am proud I finished this brownie and I'm not this is not and I'm not saying anything I'm just saying hey rock on guys thank you though immensely thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you for sticking around I know this has gotta be the most boring thing imaginable but I really appreciate everybody who is here watching Miami riddle journey without it and you will never prevail but if you have too much of it you will surely fail what is it ooh I like riddles am I going am I ever good at them no am I gonna be good now you bet your ass I'm not let's see journey without it and you will never prevail but if you have too much of it you will surely fail what is it [Music] is it I have not tried that turtle ad I've never actually tried infusing with oils unfortunately I am a oh boy the riddle I have no idea oh [ __ ] I really want to google it but you'll know because you'll see me clicking so I'm just gonna google it and then you can know that I'm cheating I'm cheating I'm cheating I'm cheating I got this wide screen monitor why am I not using that it's ultra wide screen monitor excuse me Ultra wide screen alright riddle time journey confidence I get it now I see I see yes you can have too little and too much too little and nobody will invest in you and you will never invest in yourself too much however and you will be burdened with arrogance and go down like Icarus fly too close to the Sun just use that metaphor earlier today for something else but I used it as not a metaphor but as a story as the story as a metaphor but not the story of Icarus but it I used it now in a matter of fashion boy guys oh we crossed the three hour mark this [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it's been three hours since I first had the Korova mint black bar and it was taste it tasted gross but it got me pretty it got me high and I'm only getting higher this is wheats this is 1,000 milligrams THC it's a lot somehow supposed to do this for two more hours seems like it's gonna be impossible turtle 88 no that's totally fine totally happy to answer that question my favorite oh man I wish I could have shared some I totally wish I could have shared some Victoria gray it would have been it would have been totally wonderful to to split some of this to share some of this burden but it is what it is my favorite edible turtle 88 I really appreciate yes the question great question great question my favorite edible is say the kirova is 250 milligrams s'mores brownie easy-peasy pretty much any of their 250 milligrams products are great though get super super high and I love mo I am sorry that I am barely conscious this is then more laborious somehow both more and less laborious than I would have thought I both thought I would have passed out by now but I also thought that I I have no way of making that make sense unfortunately I am too high to connect those dots make those points intersect but that line ooh and my voice is going out it is going is going going going and I just keep talking about the same things over and over and over again and I really really really feel like I need to do maybe pass out at some point soon that seems like that might be a nice thing to do thinking about how comfortable my bed feels how good it would feel to lie down on it how good it would feel to be on my bed I don't even need to put the covers on I could just put my head on the pillow and turn on a fan or the a/c and just get really really really yeah it would be it would be really nice that's kind of what I would like to do oh [ __ ] very high very high bad Wow it's only 507 p.m. here but I can't tell you how wonderful a bed feel would feel right now just what the softness and the comfort and the sheets like the pillows of the pillows do I think I'll go to space I definitely think I will be in outer space I think I might even be enter some other sort of transdimensional void or something that's what it would feel like to go to bed right now I can't but do you understand how good pillows feel they feel so good oh my god when your head it's like lying on a pillow you just get to lie there and go take a nap and sleep sleep oh man never take sleep for granted do I think I'll go to space oh you were being serious oh [ __ ] I'm so high god I hope so is the answer to that question the answer yes no no my answer is no I think the geopolitical situation is way too volatile right now to ever hope to like let's say the world had continued to pace with Hillary Clinton I'm not saying that Hillary Clinton was wonderful or the perfect candidate or you know about seeing for anything but just what she's not to get political I am so sorry I don't mean to offend anybody politically but I just think that the world is too geopolitically volatile to have the investment required for any real personal space travel whether it be governmental or or through private business to be affordable for for any reasonable rate now I think if the world had sort of continued to pace in the kind of like Obama kind of growth era with you know with with Tesla and Amazon fighting their rocket battles I think that yes I would have gotten into space at some point in my life but yeah I think I think in but I don't think right now the world is in a place where that kind of investment could be made in any in any real way to make it happen excuse me in an affordable way I hope it can happen even for the elite I mean honestly that they'd be fine with me just to have it more common forever you know for for humankind period but I'm not even sure that that'll be the case um shit's bad [ __ ] is very bad unfortunately the world is not in a good place politically and and doesn't look like there's any hopeful signs on the horizon not to be too much of a downer well Thank You turtle 88 Victoria gray I do occasionally participate in meditation or or what what is the the other term for it meditation or and that you know what I'm talking about sometimes they do that thing and it's good I rarely do it high though I don't know why I don't do it I often I find myself needing things more visual oftenly when I'm high like I crave stuff for my eyeballs when I'm very high so meditation would be very difficult for me to achieve wow it would be very difficult for me to meditate effectively because I would be constantly wanting to see something to do something with my eyes so I guess I don't do that that reason but I should give it a try because I bet you're right I bet it is totally incredibly intoxicating and relaxing a hundred k2 hits suborbital flight right now I think well one sub oh yeah several fighters I guess close enough to considering getting into space it where is it 100k I guess I mean is it you know can you can you really just drop if you if you were a millionaire could you really drop a hundred K and go into suborbital space I mean that'd be great that'd be great I totally totally awesome that I I mean I have no reason death that's true and I did not realize it was that cheap and yeah I would assume me we get cheaper but I would still say that a hundred K is prohibitively expensive for him you know 99.5% of well maybe 99% of people for even a once-in-a-lifetime experience but maybe it becomes like maybe maybe become such a transcended things maybe maybe going into outer space become such a transcendent incredible wonderful thing that it becomes the new religious experience and then it does become worth incredible expense like it would be like your lifelong tithe or your trip to Mecca you know the incredible once-in-a-lifetime expense that you make just to to sort of experience spiritual bliss that would be cool that'd be cool if if that if our you know obsession with them spending money on religion religious pump pump a tree and ornament REE where instead invested in space travel that'd be really great if we can sort of just convince people that that those things were equal and it doesn't seem to me like it should be that difficult a thing of course it would be impossible to do but theoretically like because how amazing it would be to go into suborbital space even it seems like it should be such a transcendent experience that it could be you know as spiritually fulfilling as like a a guy who rose from the dead or whatever or you know pick your eye not to pick on one religion but yeah space travel I would love I totally hope one day to be in honor space now it'd be amazing in my lifetime I just don't I do not foresee it happening I totally think we were there but I think we've backslide um unfortunately my voice this this is a hump that I did not I I kind of thought about it like I kind of thought oh man talking for five hours that might be tough but I had no idea just how ill-prepared I was going to be Minh ravaging actually I can't believe how little I can speak at this point yeah Wow Oh guys okay I am starting to feel a little queasy unfortunately and and I might for the sake of not having to cheese yeah I am starting to feel just a little and well I think I haven't eaten enough food yet today with all this getting high I might have to go eat some food or something and and come back unfortunately in that and my voice is is rapidly giving out completely uh man yeah guys I think I am I am going to have to call it pause Here I am very sorry that I make it the full five hours but I really enjoy talking to each and every one of you for this long it's been a total total blast Thank You Korova it's been a real trip I promise you you're gonna get your money's worth if you tried this one be sure to share it with like 20 friends like they suggest I thank you guys I really appreciate it and we will we'll see you again in the future thanks again bye everyone good night or good afternoon wherever you are bye",

more than 60 families at a food bank at the First Baptist Church in Roy this morning the church partners with the Utah Food Bank Fox 13 Sydney Glenn is in Roy tonight Sydney what are police saying about this well let's ask them ourselves right now I am live with sergeant Gwen and they are responding right the second you can see all of the officers behind me talk to me about the latest several children accidentally ingested this candy today yes a little after 3 o'clock this afternoon we were notified that a five year old girl was in the hospital for a THC overdose and we learned that the candy she ingested was provided to them through a Food Bank donation center here in Roy and so what you're seeing now was our officers are actively reaching out I believe it's 72 different families to make contact with them to ensure that we can recover as much as we can make sure those children who have ingested are seeking medical attention so you said to me earlier five children and told so far you have confirmed have ingested there's two of them in the hospital how successful have you been in reaching out to those families so we're looking at reaching out to 72 families and I think so far we've contacted I believe it's 44 families and we haven't been notified of any new victims probably within the last couple of hours let's talk about this huge response that you have right now for something that has never happened here before it's never happened here before and I can say probably for the first time in my career here we've actually called out half the department for an incident such as this you know and it's just a mistake and this is what it turns into you guys learned so far well we've learned so far that we need to be able to respond to these with haste to make sure that no other children are injured or two maybe notify those who aren't aware of what's in their donation that they need to be looking through them probably more carefully to ensure that this doesn't continue and we unfortunately have a bunch of volunteers who are trying to do a good thing and unfortunately this is what a yeah such an unfortunate situation I also spoke with the Utah Food Bank earlier today the CEO says she's just absolutely horrified about what happened the president and CEO of the Utah Food Bank said they were absolutely horrified that this product went out she went on to say she can easily see how volunteers would not have known what to look for a spokesperson for the agency said the THC candy donation came through a bulk commercial donation the CEO of the Utah Food Bank expressed her apologies and said they are changing their procedures to make sure this never happens again so if you are one of those people that did get that THC infused nerds rope you're asked to call the Roy City Police Department if your child has ingested that you should call the Utah poison control we have all those phone numbers for you on our website Fox 13 now calm for now live at the Roy City Police Department Sydney Glenn Fox 13 News Utah", "mPfFk3qu8Qo": "Tripp keber is making a big bet on the legalization of marijuana his company produces cannabis infused edibles but I have

sherry here with a review today of coda signature cannabis infused chocolate bars now this big mess you see in front of me is the after-effects of a chocolate tasting party some friends and I have last night to taste these various chocolate bars and it's a mess cos one we were excited to taste the chocolate but really it's a big mess like this because the folks at coda are very very serious extremely serious about childproof packaging so these were a bear to get into I mean you're gonna need some hardware to get into these boxes like some scissors or a knife or something but once we did get into those boxes there was delicious medicated treasure inside and these came in a bunch of flavors and we really loved most of them and I'll get to the ones we didn't in a minute but there is some really creative flavors and even some flavors that kind of sounded funky to me like caramel and corn or coffee and donuts and those ended up being some of my favorites the caramel and corn has a sweet salty thing going on kind of like kettle corn does that made it pretty irresistible coffee and donuts tasted like a milk milk chocolate snickerdoodle cookie so that was good the maple and pecan bar had a really nice subtle undertone maple flavor that I loved my favorite of all though is the fire and orange which was a delicious orange flavor dark chocolate with just a hint of chili pepper spice the snap and spice for me had to overpowering a flavor of ginger but those in the group that like ginger did like that one as well the one nobody likes though was the cream and crumble that was a white chocolate bar that was meant to taste like cheesecake everybody thought that one kind of had a funky flavor especially on the aftertaste but we loved loved loved the rest of these Koda in few use chocolate bars now each bar has a hundred milligrams of co2 extracted THC and each little square is a five milligram dose and if you don't want to just eat your chocolate bars plain see the links below for my recipe to dab torch s'mores because you could use a little square of this chocolate in that recipe to make some fabulous medicated s'mores so check out that link below Kota signature chocolates they're made from ethically sourced cacao from South America so you can feel good about eating them right now they are available in California and Colorado I hope they're going to be expanding beyond that but right now if you're in California or Colorado you can enjoy these fabulous gourmet chocolate bars eat your weed [Music]", "IIqB1wlfboE": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching and have a

I have promised with my SI joints the arthritis is in my back and also my shoulder in my neck I have a bulged disc between c4 and c5 the amount of pills that they have tried me on is ridiculous I'm on currently on naproxen 500 I'm on a muscle relaxant you name it I I'm just tired of the pill so I'm gonna try this for the first time and see if this helps at all okay so get off okay so I opened it it is that's here let's see okay like chocolate actually tastes really good so I guess it takes up from 30 minutes to two hours I'll let you know I'll come back and let you know if I feel anything or do I have to take another one let's hope this works okay so um it's been like an hour and I feel something in there my legs a little bit jiggly right now but other than that the pain in my back I will say it's going away like it it's probably still there is just going away like I can't it's not a thumping feeling anymore [Music] so it's like 1 1 square which is 25 milligrams and for me it's working good like downstairs I was thinking I should shut off my phone and restart it but I guess I did and when I went to record this I didn't understand why the phone was turning on and so I just had to I just had to hit the button on the side and wait for it to start up and so that happened at home and my arms really sore from holding this but it's like nice to be pain-free and okay well this is all for now else to tell you that you feel really happy like thinks that you think it sounds like [ __ ] up in your head like you're gonna say it sentence and like I don't know did you say it so um my eyes feel real tingly and my heart I can't feel no gum it's just a little bit scary okay this time that's it only thirsty oh yeah I'm thirsty I feel like I should get into a comfy like a comfy space or a comfy place like the chair or something and don't you sit down there and then I don't know see what happens okay um so one thing I'm noticing too is my eyes are like glossy and I don't like that and there's people in the house all they're probably know something so I'm gonna wait until they come upstairs and when I hear them come upstairs go downstairs and buy it's getting dark out so they'll be see my look okay um so like you get good laughs and stuff like right now I'm trying hitting like a little paranoid I don't know what's up with that but I really think that like I should just say what you know like I'm feeling and then probably I don't know just like sit somewhere like works in darkroom or something or just come upstairs like it bad cuz the heart is like hmm and I feel I should talk like kind of quiet because seems like the thing to do um and you're really like your body seems like it's a really sensitive to everything my back ache it's it's still like I said I don't feel it at all seems like you had a long hey you come home good a squirt of that cuz you feel better from [Music] and it seems like a good thing to I get do cuz you can hide it like you know like some people say Oh going home to have a beer and if you didn't want people to know that you like drink beer you can not say it or um somebody that did this well yeah like somebody calls you oh I'm just having a piece of a chocolate bar see they wouldn't even know which seems pretty smart thing to do my fingers there but oh well because that arm hurts like that's I said some sort of things are sensitive I still haven't had gotten the drink from before some really like I'm and this and then I'll get a drink and sit there with my blanket on and oh yeah like when you walk things too early like like you're walking I'm not saying you're not just like it's not it doesn't feel normal feels like it feels like a little better like they had a key bones in your legs you probably wouldn't feel the achiness okay so it's like now I'm going for real like you know what I probably do this again good thing I only ate one no Jumanji - oh okay may need to call night when one or something cuz you probably get really scared at one point wait I'm scared but I'm like oh like you know if the cops came I would just [ __ ] hide but like if you talk to you you wouldn't you'd be so scared you would even move where you are and then they you know no way you're in there and the house okay so why can't say into next time because what if there is no next time or like Oh smoking chocolate bar number two and Oh like have episodes smoking charcoal smoking another chocolate bar now I don't remember why I say mad cuz it's totally good [Music] I was talking about Chuck burn so like this should

your dispensary and on today's review we are taking our second look at a product from canna MX taste innovation or canna mix I'm not sure how they want us to say it only the finest quality this is their milk chocolate bar with 320 milligrams of THC and if you saw our first cannon mix review it was of their 500 milligram gummy bears and we thought that was a big wet pile of dog [ __ ] so I'm giving them a fair shake for their chocolate eye I certainly hope it's good I'm rooting for it to be good I'd love to be nice and high I certainly don't not want to be stoned I didn't want to don't want to waste my money on this stuff so I'm not looking to give him a negative review but I just want to let you know right off the bat I had a very negative experience with my first product of theirs so on the back that got their mission statement here canna MX focuses on manufacturing original and healthy cannabis products that make medicating easy effective and convenient all of our ingredients are sourced from the US and made from scratch in our facility every product is carefully infused and always lab tested that wasn't true for their gummy bears their gummy bears no lab testing results on those and but it does send the BAC lab testing by CS labs although I don't see the test results on here and actually if you go to their website canna em XCOM their website is down there IP server could not be found so they have a website listed but it's not actually up which is also a very bad sign so this cost me 20 bucks at my dispensary which is a very very good deal for a 320 milligram and chocolate edible Kiva's run about 20 dollars for 180 milligrams to fajn say i've seen it up as 20 as high as 25 bucks for 90 milligrams so 320 milligrams for 420 bucks is a really good deal it's borderline a steal if it actually proves to be potin as it says it is so I really hope that to be the case let's go ahead and open it up and give this canon MX so on the inside we got pretty standard packaging nothing too special just a little wrapper and here it is oh it's in little torn off chunks it's kind of broken in there let me in total looks like six maybe yes so six rectangular we get here of the canna M X chocolate let's go ahead and give a bite of it give a taste test mmm pretty mad tasting chocolate but really no cannabis flavor whatsoever um really yeah no cannabis tastes just kind of low-grade milk chocolate disconcerting that a 320 milligram chocolate eyeball has no cannabis taste but then again I normally find chocolate is the best mask for um cannabis so there's reason to be hopeful maybe it really just is completely masked by the chocolate flavor fingers crossed as I said there's reason to doubt but I'm willing to give him the benefit out and I'm hoping to get high so guys I'm going to polish off the rest of this chocolate here and then with all as like with all our other reviews I'll be coming back to you guys in two hours to let you know that how this chocolate is landed thank you so much for watching wheat guys and I will see you in just a bit peace it's official and welcome back to wheats it's been two hours since I had the Kanna MX milk chocolate bar and what is official you might ask well it is official that I have now had the worst edible chocolate the worst cannabis chocolate I've ever had yeah this is definitely not three hundred and twenty milligrams my fears about Kenna MX were totally realized I don't feel high at all I guess maybe around it to somewhere in there possibly this is cannabis chocolate almost always gets me to a place I want to be Kiva de false a bang chill even hubby those are all I mean they're all half the milligram \u00e4j-- or less than this Canha MX but they do ten times the damage this is a shitty product from a shitty company that lies to its customers both in our gummies and in their chocolate I feel terrible because I bought another product from them that I will be reviewing as well which is I feel terrible that I've given them more money or given them more exposure because they don't deserve it it really makes me upset that they have a website on the back that does not work in any way shape or form the says the IP address is down I don't believe for a second that they're actually lab tested these products or if they are I don't believe for a second they come back as 320 milligrams they actually I take it back they might very well be will have tested they just might come back with 40 milligrams or 30 milligrams on them they say lab tested but they don't give you the results and you can't go on their website to see you know any of that information so can I MX if you are out there and you want to speak up for yourselves if you want to you know speak up for your products I would love to have you want I would love to talk to you would love to know what your company's about why and why it seems to me at least that you guys are ripping your customers off I promise you if you come on we'll give you a fair shake we will not you know it's not going to be to attack you I I'm just I would love to to have you guys because as for right now I'm gonna tell my viewers here to stay far far far away from your stuff I I think your scam artists to be entirely frank I think your con artists and I know this is probably not gonna get you to want to come on but I think you guys should be ashamed of yourselves [ __ ] you boy can MX another real debt of a product so many a row just dud dud dud I probably won't release them all as duds in a row but just know personally here at wheats HQ I have this is like the seventh review in a row that I have had that has been a complete and utter failure for me so I'm coming off just a string of losers here and canna MX might be the biggest loser of them all boy as the edibles in California start to wind down as we get closer to that date the end of June where everything has to be pushed over to the new hundred milligrams ten dose rule there seems to be a lot of shooting companies trying to make a quick buck releasing some [ __ ] products before then and canna MX is pretty high up on that list boy another bummer I am so sorry guys I really wanted something fun for you I really wanted to come to you guys blazed out of my skull singing its praises but not to be not to be thank you guys for staying tuned to this end of this review sorry I've been a little bummed out with everybody and on these reviews but we'll find we'll find that good one soon we'll find that that new winner well guys that is gonna do it for this review here on week two I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you guys on the next review peace", "iwMgD51_zEk": "first off I just want to give a little disclaimer saying that I do not condone the use of any legal or illegal mind-altering substances the contents of this video are created purely for education it's inevitable that there will be people who consume these substances therefore it is extremely important to educate people on the effects and how to properly use them so edible pot is a lot different than smoking it it's more potent it's processed in the body differently and the effects lasts longer the difference with edibles is that the active ingredient the chemical that gets you high THC is processed in the liver before the user experiences any effects the original THC from the edible is converted in the liver into a more potent metabolite 11 hydroxy THC it's estimated that this compound is about four to five times more psycho active than normal THC and because the edible has to go through a portion of the digestive process before effects can be felt it can take 30 minutes - as long as two hours before a user feels any effects because of this people who don't feel any effects after an hour so might want to reduce only to have the entire thing hit them like a train all at once an hour later so my advice just wait it out it may take a while but it will come on and unlike smoking cannabis in which the effects last about two hours and gradually drop off after a quick climax right after inhalation edible pot takes its time before it reaches its peak in effect and this peak lasts longer typically the effects of edibles lasts four to eight hours when it comes to the effects there are certainly similarities between smokeable and edible weed but there are some properties that appear to only occur strictly on edibles there are two main reasons someone would want to consume an edible the first is for medical benefits such as aiding symptom relief of stress or anxiety or to help one sleep and the second is simply just for recreational purposes just to have a high and have a time aside from these two reasons there are actually a few people in the psychedelic community who use edibles and very high doses in a similar way to what one would use LSD or magic mushrooms for but we'll touch on that aspect at the end of the video so now we are going to get into what you can expect to feel from the different doses of weed edibles but firstly it's important to know that tolerance is everything tolerance plays a huge role in your experience and if you're an everyday pot smoker you'll likely have to take a much larger dose of an edible that someone who has no tolerance to THC in order to feel the same effect so take the following effects of doses I give with a grain of salt as this is just generally what you can expect to feel when you take this particular dose so first off we have the micro dose and this ranges anywhere from one milligram to about 2.5 milligrams of THC it's unlikely you'll experience any active effects from this dose but it is possible for people who are hypersensitive to the effects of THC this dose is more just for purposes such as mild relief of pain stress anxiety etc people who Micro's THC edibles might also report increased creativity and focus the effects of this dose are pretty passive you likely won't feel any different fundamentally this can be somewhat compared to people who micro doze LSD and magic mushrooms who do so for similar purposes next we have the low dose which ranges from two point five milligrams to about 15 milligrams and the two ends of the spectrum can be very different especially for people with low tolerance to th see someone consuming the edible for medicinal purposes will experience stronger symptom relief and this dose can also be used for people who have trouble sleeping you may begin to feel a sense of euphoria and that classic high feeling where coordination is slightly impaired and overall perception is altered but if this dose the high is unlikely to be overwhelming and because of this this may be a good dose to try for a first-timer in my own experience there isn't a significant difference between this dose and edible in your average smoking weed high the medium dose ranges from 15 to 30 milligrams someone with a decent THC tolerance still may not be feeling heavy effects here but for many vistas can make them pretty high it's at those dose that people may start to feel negative effects such as anxiety and paranoia you might ask if people use weed for relief of anxiety stress then how could this dose bring on anxiety and stress well THC has biphasic effects which means the substance can have opposite effects in different doses anxiety can be reduced in lower doses but can actually be stronger in higher doses so if you're taking edibles for symptom relief it is important to be aware of these biphasic effects the drug in half coordination and perception will likely be altered at this dose that agree to which it is altered will likely depend on your tolerance some people might start to get the classic red eyes from being high maybe some people experience close eye visuals for me personally I tend to have a close eye visual on low to medium dose weed that looks kind of like this let me know if you have experienced the same type of visual in the comments the high dose ranges from 30 to 50 milligrams this dose will likely bring a significant high even to someone with tolerance and for someone with low tolerance this can bring an extreme high their coordination will definitely be impaired somewhat you might feel a strong euphoria maybe you'll feel very laughy some people's mouths get very dry and get cottonmouth this is due to THC mimicking a naturally occurring chemical called an and amide which binds to cannabinoid receptors in our saliva glands which causes saliva production to decrease you might also get the classic munchies and just want to absolutely binge eat it's important to remember that the effects of THC impacts everyone differently so no two people's high will be exactly the same and you likely will only experience some of the effects I listed not all the very high dose ranges from 50 to 100 milligrams I would say it's more likely than not that you will probably experience some negative effects at this dose but the high may become so intense you may feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed people often experience a rapid heart rate panic nausea in headaches at this dose so definitely don't venture into this realm if you don't know what you're doing for someone with an extremely high tolerance this dose might not be too heavy but for the average person this will likely be overwhelming there are still medicinal benefits at this dose but is only used for people who really need it as this dose is sometimes using cancer patients to boost appetite and is also used for people with certain inflammatory disorders personally any dose at this range or above just completely puts me on my ass the come-up is nice for me as I feel very laughy energetic and social but once the effects really start peaking I honestly begin to struggle to stay awake and wish to do nothing else but to find a cozy place to lie down and fall asleep this may have been due to the strain though as THC isn't the only psychoactive chemical we it's just the most prominent CBD is the chemical that aids with sleep and this chemical also plays a role in the overall effects of the weed and the amount of CBD in the strain will most definitely impact your experience and finally the extremely high dose is going to be anything above 100 milligrams I've heard of some edibles having 250 milligrams some having 500 and even some containing as much as a thousand milligrams obviously the effects will get significantly higher as those increases a 100 milligram edible might not be incredibly strong for someone with a very high tolerance but certainly 500 milligrams is going to put anybody on their ass be very careful of consuming edibles this powerful as there will certainly be negative effects due to the intensity it's in these very high doses that have experienced visuals reminiscent of a psychedelic trip on say LSD the visual might be something kind of like this and speaking of psychedelics there's many people who report having psychedelic like trips from high doses of weed edibles the world-famous Joe Rogan likes to discuss edible pot as along the same lines as psychedelics such as LSD psilocybin mushrooms and DMT saying that edible pot can take you down the rabbit hole there's a comment I found from someone on reddit that I thought described as similarity of the psychedelic feeling on high-dose edibles perfectly not long ago I did a hundred milligrams of THC edibles and had zero tolerance on my couch my eyes closed and no music it was awesome and the peak was over three hours I swam through the psychedelic mind a tunnel with many doors and behind each door was a memory of mine I went through them and had Total Recall I could recall past memories memories of being born my first laugh before thinking and the experience that my first thought as an infant the pure thrill of thinking now the effects of THC in the brain is nowhere close to resembling that of a psychedelic classical psychedelics interact directly with the 5-htt to a receptor in the brain and cannabis does not do this from doing research it seems to be that weed edibles tend to resemble psychedelics more often for people who have already had experiences with psychedelics in the past it's likely more often that this psychedelic feeling is also associated with strains with higher THC levels and lower CBD levels as CBDs antipsychotic effects will likely lessen the psychedelic effect but if you find yourself feeling like you're in the middle of an intense psychedelic trip I'll say what I've always said before let the experience consume you surrender to the substance let your mind flow freely and try not to attach yourself to these thoughts just simply observe don't make any attachments so that's about it for this video hopefully you have a better idea on what you can expect to feel by the different doses of weed edibles if you're new start low THC affects everyone slightly differently so see how you react to the substance stay safe consume responsibly and you'll be fine if you seek to support my work on a deeper level consider joining the patreon I run a book club on there where we read one book a month about topics we go over on this channel if that interests you definitely consider joining as always guys have a great day and peace [Music]", "8Soojxy36C8": "what's up you're cheating man and his boys are here wherever ie each 150 milligrams little guys we chose these done some dab some diamonds five right here is anyone with me I'm a ball down and go line I hope you guys are smoking wrong yes I'm sweet your stream in salad mornin [Applause] [Music] [Music] this one is [Music] we got 500 milligrams going in [Music] [Music] [Music] Tacey me it's gonna give it the what the backward [Music] [Music]", "IozkJsvCJHk": "hello senior stoner fans senior stoner back at you with another great product review this time we're going to talk about edibles we're gonna talk about edibles that I personally have used and we're going to discuss how to basically medicate yourself with edibles because there's a whole different program then there is with dabs with marijuana with syringes with THC crystals it doesn't matter what it is has nothing to compare with edibles so let's talk about what we're gonna be looking at today we're gonna be looking at PJ butter double dose was a 300 milligram bar and PJ butters triple dose cannabis chocolate bars one is a Belgian dark choc that one is a Belgian chocolate with cappuccino regardless whether they say triple or double dose what you need to look at is the milligrams of cannabis milligrams of cannabis milligrams of THC that's the important thing because my gosh the average person I would think this is a small candy bar the size of two fingers average person can unwrap this candy bar I start munching and be done with it well don't do that don't do that this isn't marijuana edible it's going to hit you much different than anything we smoked anything doesn't matter if it's a peak doesn't matter if its distill it if it's crystals if it's this wax cigar doesn't matter what it is it's not as strong as an edible and it edible is gonna be very difficult for you to turn the volume down it's gonna be very irritating for you if it gets to that point so here is the advice you must follow start small what do I mean by start small if this was the edible this is what you start with I know I know it's gonna say I'm a baby that's all I'm bigger than that I can take more than that well you can't okay average person needs to start with about a 5 or a 10 milligram dose not 300 450 not 150 you have to start with an extremely small dose in order to do that you have to have self-control reason have self-control with this this can really make you feel uncomfortable can make you dizzy can ruin your night or ruin today so I am heavily medicated at all times because I live in chronic intractable pain okay set me aside here's what has to happen with a bar like this you don't unwrap the whole bar you slide it down very carefully in its wrapper and you take a small piece of the corner remember if it's a 300 milligram bar each tenth is 30 milligrams that's too much okay the 450 milligrams bar each tent is 45 milligrams that's too much too much for the average person too much for most of my viewers most of my subscribers and it's not a bad thing this doesn't make us web skies and gals anybody who uses edibles understands what I'm saying because we've all been to that bad spot once at least so you must follow what it says beware everybody see the nice word there beware well you have to beware okay this is not scaring you this is coaching you you have to beware that this is not going to happen to you okay so you must start and increments the size of this piece of the square of the sticky note that's right smallest piece you can pick is what you start with there was a bar I used to use when they made it that was a thousand milligrams and literally if I took crumbs off of it I would feel good so once you buy these bars or these chocolates you have to really practice with them in a small doses to understand how strong they are I guess the best way to put it is it's like baseball they train you when you were little in the outfield to always run back to try to catch the ball when it's hit because you can always run forward easier than running back to catch the wall they always train you with pain medicine take your pain medicine at a set time during the day make sure you keep it taking it regularly at a set time there any day so the pain doesn't get ahead of it because you very often have a hard time getting pain under control with pain medicine if you can take the pain medicine ahead of time or while it was happening because when it crescendos the pain medicine might not work the same thing with something like this okay you have to give this a lot of time a lot of patience okay and whether it's the pj butters which I have here the three hundred the four fifty bars or whether it's another edible don't think you're Superman or superwoman you are not okay whether it grabs you in an hour or five hours it's gonna grab you don't do it be happy go slow and enjoy your edibles this is senior stoner with the pj butters chocolate review have a great day and be careful of your animals", "pRUcYVvUkBY": "hello stoners and stoners welcome back to stone alone today we're going to be talking about some [ __ ] today we're doing a strain review on a blackberry kush so i picked up some of those humboldt farms this still wasn't cheap but in california i would say this is on the more affordable end of things before you know there was top shelf but now there's exotic shell [ __ ] it's just getting crazier and more and more expensive with delivery and everything came out to be about 60 dollars this is in indica i gotta say the nose on this the smell was amazing in the bag it lingering out you know i would say this is a blackberry smell but i don't think blackberries smell very much you know like i've seen them in the wild and this is a very kiefy flower like i said i only have crumbs left but it's a [ __ ] on a keefe so i'm gonna blaze that up real quick [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] very much this uh this tasty taste maybe i should search up this strain so lethally says herbal peppery and citrus pain management thanks to its body high effects it's a combination combination of afghani and blackberry nice it says it has a hashy jet fuel taste and aroma that is balanced by sweet berries nice nice nice relaxed happy sleepy euphoric and hungry i will agree that uh i got this hungry feeling from it i'm still feeling a little cerebral high i'm feeling a little goodness up there but it's not making my mind a race i'd say very good balance definitely been getting very high off it it's crazy seeing this level of weed again seeing just the [ __ ] ton of trichomes that is on here it's completely keefed up so many little pestles all right listen we gotta pay the bud tender so we got a sponsored segment the ganja berries wait a sec seriously thank you to ganja berry because otherwise i would not have been able to afford this weed these right here are actually made out of real goji berries from goji berries you can pack up to a gram and a half in here it's tasty and it'll have that slow burn best part these are actually pretty cheap i'm gonna open one right and you can use code stoned alone for another 15 off devlin check him out show him some love because that is how we acquired the cannabis for today's room jumping back into the blackberry strain cannabis infused dark chocolate bar with a hundred milligrams of blackberry and i'm gonna pull up the effects on that because it is a different strain blackberry is a mother strain of the blackberry kush so this is cool because i don't even realize ah it is raspberry cough crossed with the strain black domina and it's a buzzy and relaxing my tolerance has been pretty low and when i ate this hundred milligrams of course it started off a bit by bit like you know i'm really i'm just gonna eat one piece it's like i'll eat a few more pieces i'll eat the five pieces and then i you know eat the whole [ __ ] thing so before corova a different company used to sell thousand milligram [ __ ] bars and it would be like this giant scotch-a-roo thing i guess that's what you would call it and uh the whole thing was super strong so that [ __ ] was definitely the bang for the buck but i do understand why they cap it at 100 milligrams because i ate the whole [ __ ] thing you know and with munchies it's like you know it's a chocolate bar like obviously i want to eat the whole [ __ ] chocolate bar it's like really hard to just stop at one that [ __ ] is strong and there's so many memes about it that's the classic [ __ ] like oh these edibles and these edibles ain't gonna do nothing and then you know getting laid out by it it kind of tripped me out because again this is described as a relaxing high as a euphoric high but at just the highest dose like this it feels so strong in the head is like it doesn't really matter what strain it is it feels like this kind of sativa meltdown what's funny to me is every time this happens it's like getting too high or like you know even tripping or something it's in the moment i almost don't realize what's even happening because i was hitting my delta eight cartridge and i was just like damn i'm so [ __ ] hot i'm like this is crazy and then i was getting so high that i wasn't even thinking that i wasn't even realizing i'm just like what is happening like am i dreaming right now and like i just completely forgot that i even ate edibles i just wasn't even thinking about that i'm just like what happens like am i in between days am i in yesterday am i like about to go into tomorrow it was just uh it was really funny like being on that level so i just took a nap and kind of waking up during the nap and being like oh [ __ ] right i'm [ __ ] on edibles and i feel like psychedelics are almost easier to ride because in a psychedelic it's like it's crazy but you kind of ride with it and it'll change into something else it'll kind of like you know turn back around it'll loop but with an edible it's just like oh [ __ ] cause you know of course it's still just weed but it's just like a lot of input in the brain it's just like i wasn't able to just ride with it you know i was trying to go with the flow which is kind of like super powerful like trying to just sleep through it but then you know it's like halfway between the dream world it's a good time but it's just uh it's strong waves it's harder to just kind of like you know dissipate into it it's more just like definitely the blackberry edibles are very good smacked i was chapped i was very [ __ ] high and then i picked up some weight afterwards my uncle and i are convinced they're like is that edible you ate that weed and that's why you know like you got fat tasty stuff when i didn't know what weed i was getting and you know it still happens for sure that is one annoying thing is when it becomes super racy and you don't even know you just hit it it's like oh [ __ ] i like the strain because it is not that i find that sometimes with sativas it'll kind of like burn me out and then i'll actually kind of crash from the sativa and be very tired later later on so i'll pick a sativa because i'm like oh it's very energetic but then it kind of has a crash to it i like this indica i'm not feeling you know the gear is turning super fast i'm just feeling a good body high i'm feeling you know baked i'm feeling warm and generally that's what i'm looking for what i want to smoke you know as close to that as i can get that body and kind of hot great one i feel like for just chilling watching movies and [ __ ] for me like doing the editing not going too wild with it blackberry crossed with afghani kush well again shout outs to ganja berry they're the sponsors show them some love it's cool seeing these new companies pop up and this is definitely a fresh thing let me know if you want to see more strain reviews it is fun to delve into it because otherwise you know maybe i wouldn't have specifically looked out and tried some blackberry so i'm glad i did and this was a fun little experience especially having both the herb and the chocolate also yes this is the herb that has appeared in the stoned alone movies the upcoming detective trip as well as back in usa and this is a strain that i would recommend and come back to because it's very chill i'm feeling fantastic and i just finished it all so i would definitely love some more i enjoyed smoking this weed eating this uh chocolate i'll be seeing you around in the next time ciao and uh

don't have an actual point to it I'm just going to be taking the most edible so I ever have on camera in fact I know a lot of youtubers will do some crazy [ __ ] where they like take a thousand milligrams or something but I have to work myself up there because yes I do dab I smoke a lot of flour and I do take edibles recently more than ever however I am no seasoned pro I'm a huge stoner of course but edibles they're a whole different [ __ ] ballpark no matter how much weed you smoke an edible can knock you out ten times harder it's just facts today I'm coming at you with this hubby's crunch bar so I'm pretty sure the legal limit for a dispensary for one package of edibles is a hundred milligrams all of the dispensaries I go to it caps out at a hundred but you can go to some trap shops and different stuff on the down low and get higher dosage edibles why was I like higher dosage edibles but due to quarantine it's just been way busier trying to get we delivered so I actually picked this up from a friend well not really friend like a mutual friend and so this one has three doses of 130 milligrams so that's equal to 390 milligrams of THC to put this into perspective if you're a lightweight you could probably get highest [ __ ] off of like 30 40 milligrams I'm more of a heavyweight so it takes more like a hundred milligrams for me to really notice a huge difference at 150 I'm high as [ __ ] so I'm actually kind of scared I feel like there's a certain point where I probably won't get any higher I just make me tired but I could be wrong so we're covering our bases [Music] Wow huh that is so strong I don't really like it edibles used to disgust me to the point where I could barely get it down I would have trouble swallowing them like I'd be gagging it's not that extreme anymore it's the same way with liquor for me honestly even wine I'm very sensitive to certain tastes good a lot of it I honestly think is psychological because I've eaten more edibles over time and I've just kind of been like I don't know why it grosses me out so much it's literally just weed it's like an herb [ __ ] it should I eat this whole thing okay last little bit I'm just gonna eat this all at once this is way too strong taste wise but at least I know it's gonna be working because I feel like with edibles if they're not just right they don't even get you hot definitely hit that like button if you enjoyed this video you want me to do edibles again and try to do some kind of tasks I think it might be funny but we'll check back in in a little bit when I'm really starting to feel it [ __ ] I'm scared the sky is going off enough my balcony is perfect because it's just the right height for the bong no one's gonna see me out here being sneaky you know you know when you're like too impatient for the edible to hit so you're like let me just smoke a bowl and then you smoke a ball and you're like [ __ ] I'm already high and then the edible hits and you're ten times [ __ ] higher I anticipate that's about to happen but nonetheless we're hitting a ball I'm such a bong ash [ __ ] sounded like I said ball message I'm like that too it's crazy how much traffic you can actually hear considering when I'm inside and I shut the window it's pretty damn quiet let's see one more hit I think the edibles creepin up on me I think I don't know what I got myself into I didn't think super hard about this I'm gonna be high as [ __ ] I think that's just actually setting in anything for the content like let's [ __ ] get going lately I've been wanting to make videos and just be goofy and be myself on camera was just so hard it's like I'm not like other girls and just like let me find show everyone suck my vibes with a straw [ __ ] subscribe to suck up my vibes do you spit or swallow Thomas we have to zoom out so dramatic effect Thomas I I'm on the verge right now you know when you're on the verge you're on the cusp if you will of an edible and it's like you're not you're not high as [ __ ] you're you're still kind of just like in limbo but you're not you're not you anymore you're an enhanced you I'm literally in Thomas's bathroom oh my god double volumes oh my god Angel volumes oh my god green vibes and you didn't give me one look at how it's reflecting off the walls I'm not gonna lie if I was tripping this would be crazy first of all it's a sour patch kid second of all I don't have that in my closet yes look how cool and dramatic this is I was like looking in the mirror there's all the lights and then I just like can see outside the sky is super gray it's gonna be a long night guys or mine I'm I just falls I could leave who knows but I'm I'm not tired right now my thumb looks hella weird from this angle I wanted to you know I can't explain but like it looks like it's like unattached Rostow I just had to lay here because because why this is a [ __ ] light show look how I had to see it in fashion me when I'm rolling I'm not rolling on anything rolling on rollin rollin on the river my grandpa fish that's thing about when you would wait press the button if you ever seen [ __ ] I had one but it wasn't it was an animatronic little guy in a big wrong oh my god we were meant to be sisters you disagree [ __ ] sisters what are we twins I had to resort to my bed it looked cozy I don't know why my thumb looked so weird to me earlier but it looked like the ligament was like I can't explain of it like once I realized I was cackling in my bed alone I laughed even harder this is not okay quarantine be like you guys okay I am not exaggerating when I say this my eyes have not been this red since I was like a freshman in high school let me be like sophomore it doesn't [ __ ] matter but the point is when I was way younger and I would smoke weed and my eyes would get so red and people will be like Oh your eyes won't get ready morning like okay but you don't understand how red they used to get it's like that right now I'm familiar bowled it open wide it just looks scary I'm eating Cheerios now oh my god aesthetic Cheerios Honey Nut of course cuz I'm not a monster this is God's nectar this is the best thing I've ever had these loops of goodness bestow such greatness upon me nothing could quench and fulfill my soul quite like these honey nut cheerios and they're doing a great job I could never ask for anything more I'm humble okay y'all hat okay look at my nose oh my god I feel like I have huge bug eyes it's like bug life so you guys I am so gone like [ __ ] these glasses at this point I look a mess okay guys I think I'm gonna go to bed oh my god I can't even talk right so this is what happened when I took a lot of [ __ ] edibles almost 400 milligrams I got stupid high as expected why am i coughing I love you guys so much I need to just go to bed I'm so [ __ ] tired and I have not been sleeping right for days so at least now I'm gonna knock the [ __ ] out but I'll talk to you guys soon bye [Music]", "_ye7_mXKUuk": "[Music] the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are talking high five chuckles again high five chocalate this is their dark chocolate bar 200 milligrams of THC I've already reviewed one of their products liked it quite a bit I reviewed their milk chocolate this time we're looking at the dark and I gotta say I'm pretty I got good expectations high expectations for this one because the first one was such a success so we're out here at the beautiful dog beach you can look behind you and see all these wonderful ships maybe maybe not long the beach I believe the second largest port in the United States may be the first largest by dollar amount it's even a little larger spy dollar amount or byte the total tonnage I care I have smashed my finger making this very difficult to open guys oh wait wait I see something here ah I got it but I'm dealing a thumb so here we go we've got our high five bar here you can see it with its little logo embossed on it let's give a bite of the dark chocolate again this is 200 milligrams oh and it cost me I believe 15 dollars at my dispensary so a pretty good deal for a 200 milligram chocalate bar oh no tastes pretty good good dark chocolate nice quality almost zero cannabis taste - uh - speak up almost none whatsoever just a good quality chocolate alright guys whoop I'm gonna finish this off and I will come back to you in two hours or through the magic of editing just in a couple of seconds and we'll let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review thanks for watching guys and I'll see you in just a bit peace [Music] two two hours later alright guys we are two hours in the future um and I am talking about high by dark chocolate 200 milligrams of THC and curiously at least curiously to me I am less high than I was for the milk chocolate I definitely am less high than I was that the less high five bar not dramatically so not the golf isn't extreme but I am noticeably less high I'd say I'm maybe four right now which is not as high as I was hoping to be I was hoping I was gonna be as high as the last one but that's just not the case so maybe their chocolate isn't super consistent I don't know yet we will experiment some more with high five but I I would say for sure I definitely feel less high than I did the first time just look at my eyeballs why does snow not that's a perfect metric by any measure but you know in a pinch it'll work so this time it was a little bit of a disappointment for hi-fi uh yeah I was I was expecting more so they got pinged a little bit for that I'm sure just four diminished or four reduced expectations but I'm human so I'm fallible I still don't hate it I still like the way it tasted and it's still and I'm still kind of high so you know it's not a complete loss and it was it was 15 bucks so it's not the most expensive chocolate bar edible it's just this is no longer in the same ballpark as like a Akiva bar this is this is out of that contention out of that conversation now well guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching as always and we will check you out on a later of you piece spec pack through our why is my tongue blue Oh brisk that's why bye guys", "Qqm0eS5nKmw": "okay so in my current attempt to worry less and experiment more I'm coming out of a sixteen and a half hour fast into this is a candy bar with a hundred milligrams of THC see how it is okay so when you finally wrestle with the childproof packaging which is also micro proof you get this it's a pretty little gold bar it's pretty being that this is the first carbs I've had in a few days it's actually really good you actually don't get a hint about cannabis flavor and who raped you oh no how far hundred milligrams are gonna take me cuz I believe I have a pretty high dollar okay so it has been one hour since I had my candy bar and while I wouldn't say that I feel high I I feel good there's definitely an edge gone a little bit of a body low I'm very uh positive okay now it has been to two hours since I ate my candy bar and now yeah I'm high I'm very tingly and they calm my body weighs a lot it turns out that 100 milligrams just write him out for me okay it has now been three hours since I ate my candy bar now I'm feeling just absolutely fantastic you'll notice the we're on the road because we've had to go buy 20 cheeseburgers I love you okay so 100 milligram bar we're probably five six hours now when I lost count awesome I really think I could even help my dosage coolest thing about all this is just the availability of something like this it was $25 at the dispensary the fact that something like that exists at the dispensary that you can go to the store and buy weed is just a mind-boggling world I'm glad we live in it until next time", "hbjvNpQ8B4Q": "our do deliveries presents the review of Corolla edibles

"please state your name my name is Stephen right on we're gonna be putting you through a bit of a wringer a few tests to see how the how the Korova bar fix you you want to read us what's on the package they're basically the warning label states medical cannabis edibles may cause drowsiness keep out of reach of children and pets do not operate a motor vehicle while taking this medication there's really no warning about one's own fate would you say you have a rather high cannabis tolerance when it comes to edibles very confident you enjoy them yes but this one this one's a thousand grams 20 doses and the mark does say 5150 on it what does that mean to my understanding that is the code for psychotic behavior please need to take proper action it does okay well then uh yeah let's go ahead and start this [ __ ] challenge [Music] take a deep breath [Applause] check it out that is pretty sweet moist it is very moist and kind of tell there's like two different kind of chocolate layers in there this thing so they really did a good job making that is delicious [Music] show us the Keen mouth it squeeze it is yeah I have 20 doses of THC you're currently going into my stomach which will soon take effect into my system we'll see how that goes keep you posted as you can see it is gone it is absolutely delicious and what's the other miss this day goes to [Music] 30 it was all

at the sky with your balance not too bad not too bad now you need to count from one to twenty five counting only every third number and backwards last count down twenty-five backwards counting every third number okay five point you yeah for one okay that was a marginal pause but we'll call it a bus so you're not feeling it no I just feel it's not okay but we're we're two and a half hours in you know this is and your eyes look fine I feel funny from the things okay maybe maybe it has taken effect three looks like the pelvic bone of an animal you better choose one of them yeah it looks like -

hey do you like the bar a good bar b bar you'd recommend it I was to your granny no would you recommend the whole bar necessarily cause it tastes so good do you probably chop it up into and you'll

on how the Korova challenge win no freak outs no nothing like that wanted to give you the official count on the THC on the bar 1100 CW analytical really did a great job good layout here you can see my hidden THC camp 1133 so breakdown of the bacteria the mold the yeast as far as pain relief and stuff like that I mean hands down it's a great bar if you're trying to get something out of it as far as like messing up your day or really getting screwed up and stuff like that it's not that kind of bar have a lot of water handy the next day I did have a splitting headache for about the majority of the day to anyone out there who would like to repeat this sort of thing or try it for yourself have some water maybe a friend nearby but yeah have at it there's a lot of fun tastes delicious [Music]", "VqqYRm723XQ": "let's get Bert okay uh I think things are starting to get rolling here I think let's just make sure as we get stuff you know off the ground we'll just start talking about what's gonna happen here on this just a stream coming up all that fun stuff um let's see so this stream as we as advertised is going to be a good old fashioned challenge I know you guys love them this time we are going to be doing another 1,000 milligram challenge here live over a long long long stream I'm a little nervous because I'm already a little high and by a little high I mean quite high and I still have this to go so I'm feeling a little nervous Austin I'm just feeling a little bit more nervous than in general I don't know why I've got like stage fright or something here listen my voice dropping um what was it gonna look up oh yes let's see here yeah I feel like I've got a little stage fright or maybe it's just this maybe it is just this knowing I'm enough to do a thousand milligrams I I've never I don't know anything about dank wood pharmacy Pro dank as dean so I have no idea and you know what if this is as strong as advertised I've never reviewed it I don't I mean it seems hyper local it's addressed here in Long Beach you know so it's it's it's not a big product so it could be a total dud I guess you know it could be just in fact could be a complete that you know nothing can happen I could just be as high as I am right now I hope that's not the case I you know III hope to to be on the moon what do I think of little pomp what is uh what is little pomp oral Lancaster I'm not sure let me know and I'll tell you what I think of it so you know could be a total dud I'm guessing it's not I found syrups to be generally speaking pretty potent as long as this company is honest you know which is kind of um unfortunately not always the case in the edible industry that you know honesty isn't there first isn't the first value in when it comes to the marijuana edible industry unfortunately honesty is not it's not the first virtue I think getting that money is unfortunate so I will be doing all this over the course of you know a little bit there is four ounces in here which is a lot because I'm sure this is going to take growth this is going to taste gross I you know I'm gonna wishing in half and drink all this junk because it looks thick and nasty I'm sure it's gonna taste disgusting oh he's the new rapper that a 17 years old and he pops to experts add a sip saline every day and smokes ounces every day oh my god a little pump I'm gonna have to look up little pump

pump okay let's check out this reddit thing mo run right here oh my god you're right yeah Jesus Christ oh my god what do I think of them I think the guy is probably headed for a complete and total he's headed he's barreling straight towards death would be my guess but you know more power to him his body he can do with you can do with it as he wishes but it seems to me he is on his way to nine anybody who does that many drugs in that short amount of time and at that young age well I guess your body is sort of equipped to handle it you know better than ever at that age but your brain is still very much plastic and malleable so it's hard to say or hard to think that doing all those drugs is going to have any you know beneficial things for his his brain uh because you know if he I only think about him as an artist I have no clue if he's talented or not but probably sabotaging his future artistic career right now by taking on these drugs but I'm not too horrible a breach again I'm you know that's totally fine with me whatever he wants to do again he's 17 god damn well Lancaster you open up a real hornet's nest here because I am not sure how to answer that question I guess my answer is okay so soon we will open this pro dank zine and see what's what's going on see if if we're gonna survive this big big old challenge here this thousand milligram challenge oh I tried my very first CBD product today I will be up in a review people have been asking me for a long time to do CBD CBD I always said like I just don't know if I am the guy for CBD it doesn't seem to be something that I would benefit from I'm not sure if my opinions have changed drastically but I found the experience illuminating I'm glad I did it and I probably will be reviewing some more CBD products in the future but but as for right now yeah I finally did it finally why I took my first CBD product and and thought it was and thought it was a worthwhile experience so you know ABI what it me um what else Oh exciting things have been happening here a tweets like super exciting things we will have oh let me go back up from exciting things Oh backing up backing up guys first off I am super high right now

the package let's let's start it at least by you know opening the seal and seeing what's gonna happen cuz that's gonna you know once we once we break that seal everything will just get a little bit easier from there just a little bit you know because what we'll have started the process it won't be so intimidating won't have to fear from my life I won't have to fear that I'm gonna call an EMT and

many other in many ways in my like a three-year-old and in being imperiled by scissors is one of them goddamn guys how do you expect people to [ __ ] open pardon my french is it infused glycerin it does not say actually what it is here I will put it right up to the camera let you take a look it's mostly just really bad puns but that is all of the information that is provided oh I do see glycerin in the ingredients so maybe perhaps and I'm realizing that you probably can't read that through this shitty webcam and I have yet to invest in a DSLR got it open for a better webcam experience you know I've invested in a drone for whatever reason but not a DSLR and backwards priorities mistaking priorities here a tweets yeah well then the drone is more fun right so that's why that's why we've got the drum okay oh boy here we go 250 milligrams per ounce of the dank word pharmacy from four two zero one west cush Avenue in Long Beach California nine zero seven three one ha ha ha my

that you should ever have to have a chaser guys this smells like liquefied weed I mean it doesn't it's like they didn't flavor it at all it's just like it's it's just straight-up the smell of it's like you know if they had made a perfume out of weed it's it's terrible smelling and it cannot oh my god what am i bitching about let's just do a little bit of it all right I'm gonna aim to do about a quarter of it for now let's see what happens oh it's so thick it's Oh Dutch girl stroopwafels man uh I'm pretty sure I reviewed those exact product from Colorado in my vacation there they were they were really really good man and yes it is way better than pure syrup if those are the same thing that I had those work great I really really enjoyed this a hell of a lot are you I'm guessing then you're you're in Colorado the ends and pants if so man enjoy all right I have to do a little bit more of this I didn't make it to nearly a quarter nice dude enjoy I will not be I mean I'll be enjoying later hopefully but I will not be enjoying right now here we go little bit more down the hatch got to get to at least a quarter oh well I don't know if you can tell but I think I've gotten to about a quarter now Derby man yes there's noises are arousing I agree that's why I'm doing them that's why I'm making them oh I think you can't tell from the camera I'm watching myself oh I'm just trying to get the Derby man off right now you know it'll you know what I hope watch that taste them some kettle chips spicy castle flavor I think it might even be this is what we call buzz marketing kettle brand crinkle cut potato chips spicy queso they're delicious they make your weed not taste as shitty that's free nice way for you cuddle cut do with that what you will you can die in peace now well I hope you don't die anytime soon Derby man even if you are sexually satisfied amen once once once you get one end you dude you just can't stop oh [ __ ] this one looks amazing okay I'm just gonna do this one just right now and I'm done mmm all right this is really rude you can tell them hi already because I'm being so goddamn rude whew okay um this syrup is definitely not good tasting it's actually not as bad tasting as I would have guessed from how it smelled huh but it is very hard to get through I mean it it is it's like drinking pancake syrup and it's that sort of consistency so it's trying to get it down it's just right if you're not a fool or if you're not doing like a stupid YouTube challenge my suggestion would be to mix it with something and slowly you know mix a little bit drink a little bit it's a thousand milligrams you don't need to do it this [ __ ] quickly unless you're a stupid fool like I am and a stupid fool I am indeed um and jeez Louise am I already high as she it-- Oh guys I want to just go over a couple of things with you that I went over armaros most recent vlog and by most recent I mean only vlog I got my dog down here Benny and she's being a [ __ ] she's a female dog it wasn't actually singing and salting or degrading the term turning those because they don't support that so we're gonna have some format changes boom guys you might have already seen some of our cool new logos and stuff where our okay new logo whoever you are on Fiverr that designed this logo for an amount of money that I'm not happy to have spent on it you did an okay job I'm not super pleased with it but I'm not gonna call you out by name so you're welcome it's not bad it's not bad it's not ROI all right really exactly what I envisioned but well we'll get there at some point I'm bitching we've got some other cool things coming up there will be some format changes within the reviews and themselves the reviews will largely stay the same you know the two hours the patented wheats two hours blabbity blabbity bloobity blah blah bluh all that good stuff um but what have some new bumpers will have some new logos will have some new images new graphics GRA FF IX graphics all that cool [ __ ] it's all coming up on wheats it's all coming up soon um next thing you might noticed if you looked at our freaking banner ad our super-sweet banner ad that I designed myself because they design one with squash and pumpkins or whatever and I know that's redundant because a pumpkin is a squash but I don't know what pumpkins are hey welcome mr. Shaab Schwab shop shop if I got Shaab Krait correct Schwab shop showed Brendan hey Brendan welcome we'll just go with Brendan howdy doody I'm glad you made it buddy we're just talking about some of the stuff briefly uh-oh we've already gotten about a third of the way or recorded the way through the bottle tasted really gross in case you're just now tuning in tasted super super gross didn't like it also already incredibly high started off very high feeling myself already getting higher and getting terrified because I realized that I have a lot left to do and we've barely even begun so great this is gonna be fun this is gonna be fun for everyone okay so we're going to a structured release schedule guys isn't that cool instead of just like reviews Oh first back up rewind rewind rewind we have rewound let's rewind here first I want to apologize Thank You Brandon I appreciate the encouragement I appreciate the enthusiasm we're rewinding for a second because I want to explain to you guys I want to apologize for all those notifications that you probably been getting this week for all those videos dropping like you know 10 11 videos dropping over this week or whatever and usually like a bunch dropping in a row that's because I'm trying I was clearing out some of the way little backlog and I just wanted to get it out there before we went on the structured release schedule which is coming up so that's why all those videos came out so quickly so back to forth so if you were if your phone was blowing out from notifications or whatever my apologies that battle be over with starting now because starting Wednesday of this week I think is when our structured a release schedule begins so we're gonna have videos coming out at 5 p.m. Pacific Standard Time Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday four days a week four videos a week every day what does every day mean I mean four days a week at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time so you guys can sort of expect him at that time they're not just dropping at like 10:00 a.m. or 1:00 p.m. you know maybe five days in a row and then three days off or whatever no they're just gonna be coming out scheduled now weirdly in concert with this new schedule of structured releases I will actually not be taking any THC what's the best dispensary for your buck and law reach the ends and pants the ants and pants there are actually very few dispensaries in Long Beach that's a great question you asked Long Beach just recently started allowing recreational or and not recreational no not I mean medicinal because there's no recreational anywhere until 2018 I believe California is confusing so within Long Beach I don't actually pick up anything from here there are a couple of like illegal dispensaries that I've been to a couple times but you normally pay a premium for the people being willing to have their shop be closed down which you'd be surprised the number of people that are willing to just you know I would spend the expense to open a dispensary that's definitely going to be shut down but you know whatever it's not my money so I go Orange County which I am Orange County adjacent I live all right first off Long Beach is right on the border of Orange County and I live very close to that birder so I just go into Orange County and then there I like to go to cool calm collective in Huntington Beach and then I like the best buck I've ever seen they have moved and I haven't been in a while they are now in Santa Ana they used to be and yes it is still bad in Southern California compared to Northern California for short Northern California is orders of magnitude better for we than Southern California in terms of attitudes towards you know just communities being accepting towards it legal legalities you know municipalities not trying to ban it and just the density of shops there's so many more shops in Northern California than there are in Southern California okay okay yeah Riverside I have not actually been to Riverside but I have seen the weed maps and it's a it looks like the desert that it is located in a total weed desert there um so yes Oh what was he talking about oh yes moving to release schedule guys I am so sorry imma have to turn on the AC it's gonna get a little out for a bit that but well we'll make it work we'll make it work I'm just gonna turn it on for just a second and get it cool in here and then we'll turn right back off okay yes so in concert weirdly with this this new release schedule I will be on a month-long tolerance break starting Monday September 11th going on big tolerance break I'll probably do one more wheat slide between now and then maybe that Sunday I don't know well I'll be sure to let people know through Facebook and Twitter Facebook and Twitter I'll let people know as soon as I know when and if we'll have a final weed slide before the tolerance break but guys just because I'm going on a big ol tea break does not mean that the reviews will stop I will still have reviews coming out the four times a week at least for the next like Kappa sorry everyone for that your piercing scream but when Kappas cap is here man you've got to make some noise you got to make some noise for Kappa welcome sir hey man so glad you could make it we're just talking about the new schedule and talking about the tolerance break we are or we I will be tolerance breaking for a whole month which is the longest I have gone without smoking weed since I have oh sweet do you know exactly when Kappa because if you're coming sometime in the next month I am be willing to you know take a break from this tolerance break you know just to say had my buddy Kappa but neither here nor there for now so yes taking a month-long tolerance break which will be the longest I've gone without smoking weed since I started smoking weed about five years ago now something like that I think so that's a long time not necessarily looking forward to it variety of reasons I'm doing it but it's gonna happen okay cool cool cool cool cool I'll probably be done with my tolerance break by then Oh oh my god see Dobie man you're on the worst of all situations the tolerant the unforced tolerance or the first tolerance break the tolerance break where somebody we're not one where you would want to take it but one because your hookup is not available I've had those before whoo yes the answer pants you are very correct even even a 48-hour tolerance break can do a lot to reset one's you know ability to be a nerd to cannabis but but like a 2-week if you can go on a two-week tolerance break I mean which I just did recently about a month ago oh my god um yes Kappa do it ah you're gonna have to pick up a ton of Kanako's while you're there yeah you have to experience the best of the best no from Kappa from what I have experienced I have never seen a dispensary that has had anything like a purchasing limit I mean I've seen them sell up to quarter pounds before that's the most I've ever seen anybody sell its quitter pounds but I don't know if that's necessarily a hard cap would be a quarter pound and if it is you could always this then go to another dispensary and get another quarter pound in Kappa I'm sure you are not even sure you already know this you're sure I don't need to tell you this but be sure that you visit weed Maps while you are here so that you can you know be able to find the yes so so you can find the best deals because I mean things are in terms of prices kappa i've noticed we actually recently were in the past like three months prices on things are really starting to hit an equilibrium in the market where edibles used to have crazy variance in pricing i've noticed but we're now slowly slowly slowly hitting an equilibrium in terms of pricing at dispensaries but we'd maps is still an indispensable tool it will definitely help you still find the best deals because there are great deals to be had as long as you're willing to look I do not kappa because I the most I've ever purchased at one time in terms of flower is this single ounce never done more than that and I've only ever bought an ounce twice before so I've never looked for the best wholesale prices or you know for the best absolute bang for your buck if you're buying you know again and wholesale or and bulk or whatever but I will keep an eye out for you I I know you're coming sometime in the next you know a month or a few weeks so I will keep an eye out for your consider I'd like to visit a bunch of dispensaries I will look at their prices I will even ask him if they sell wholesale and I will report back to you bud if I find anything out there great deals for you so Renan 21 tolerant day tolerance break it was great yes tolerance breaks are great but I've noticed that too your tolerance builds back up again quickly you do have like a you're sort of you have like a two-week period or at least I did where my tolerance was lowered but it did sort of hit its you know normal and sort of normalized again after about two weeks or so so it's not like a complete reset a tolerance break it just gives you like a you know a couple of weeks it that's that's assuming getting you you smoke or imbibe at the same level of THC you are doing before if you're doing a reduced amount you know weed after your tolerance break then you're you know tolerance should be sufficiently reduced for quite a bit longer but neither here nor there that's just my experience as well your mileage may vary oh okay delivery services I rarely use delivery services anymore I used them a lot when I first started because I don't use them as much because you get letter you rarely get as good of deals dirty man I do intend to finish this whole bottle before the stream ends I'm planning on streaming for a while which is why I've not yet had any more to drink but my goal is to finish this bottle before the stream ends so so I can't promise that I will you know be conscious throughout it all but I will be drinking a little bit more soon Oh Susie yes but that was my cases well Brynn and I my tolerance got back up to where it was after about two weeks but I was eating edibles at the same rate I it was before yes the California market is super super weird the ants and pants the thing I hate the most is I actually you know and I'm sorry libertarians out there I wish there was more regulation in the market here I wish I wish there was somebody out there you had to get all edibles lab tested for both pesticides and for potency because you get ripped off so often guys spoiler alert for what what is coming we're gonna have reviews for individual companies and some are going to be total complete excoriation 'he's not to name any names LOL edible food of showers um Wow Wow that is those are some pretty good deals but that's the best close to the best price of an ounce i've ever seen and the cheapest I've ever seen a 250 milligram Korova was probably $13 so I think that's the cheapest I've seen Wow oh okay I have heard about Nevada hey welcome welcome welcome welcome glad you made it I knew you were excited for the for the stream so I'm glad you could you could tune in where just to give you a heads up we're about a quarter of the way through the bottle right now we'll be doing a little bit more soon I am already high as f and got a lot left to do so I'm gonna oh sorry for my gross thumb guys look how gross that is ooh that is from the result of a GoPro mount a good point mount that got stuck and I was like trying to get the little clamp clip to come through and it finally came through and then my finger shoved in it yes I've seen those I've seen those there are a lot of people that will Skype or FaceTime with doctors now it's just because California I mean it's a joke it's a total joke in California it's a big laughing joke that everybody is going through for the next couple of months until tonight 2018 when the joke is over with yes hi already and the reason I am hi already is that I actually did a review right before this I did a review before the stream started that ended the review ended like half an hour before the stream started so I was already very high and then I did the force first quarter of the syrup which is starting to hit so now I'm already into crazy high territory and we have a lot left to do so it's gonna be fun for everyone I am sure speaking of which here we go oh so isn't the same pesticides that we'd be drinking and our wine they're using and Ben asks you bring up a good point I am I'm not the best person in the world to be concerned about pesticides have talked about being concerned in pesticides I worked up for about two years in an entomology lab where we studied fire ants and bedbugs and we played with all kinds of harsh and crazy pesticides so I'm kind of like a nerd to the scariness of pesticides and I know I'm probably gonna get cancer at some point anyways from my exposure to pesticides so I'm not super super worried about it and Kappa I hope you can find it too buddy I would check man I don't know anybody out here sort of tied in to that world of the market those sort of wholesale side to help with either I only smoke roundup Monsanto for me baby yes I will be enjoying tripping I am already getting close to trippy trippy trip been um Oh guys what um what companies do you want me to review by the way so we're going to be doing company specific reviews which are a Shrek of a lot of work eh how long have I lived in Long Beach I have a little bit in Long Beach for one year and eight months now and loved it the entire time loved it loved it loved it a Long Beach has kind of a reputation as being I don't know less-than-stellar we live in we're very fortunate to live in a very nice part in Long Beach we live in a very nice mmm area in Long Beach we but we live in a the building that brings everybody's property values down we wear the building that everybody hates but we're fortunate live in a really nice area love Long Beach totally well of the city love the vibe of the place don't get its reputation it just not great for wheat unfortunately right now yes doing a tolerance break soon why is that again have quite a few things going on IRL huge work projects coming up that I just need oh yes you do volcanoes are amazing it is it is a big expense you know the volcano but oh sure I'll get back to that in just a second why is my tolerance break happening yes have a quite a big few big work projects coming up and have some weeks projects also that I need to focus on and so because of that I will be doing this big tolerance break I don't need it to be a whole month I wait I needed to be like a couple of weeks but I decided to go for the whole month just because it could be good to take a huge month off and just you know sort of start from square one again so that's why it's happening volcanoes are awesome kappa if you've got the five hundred dollars to spend i know it's a lot to swallow but it is a hell of a way to it's my second-favorite way of doing weed behind edibles is volcano bags for sure moreso than just regular smoking more than you know more than a pipe more than a water pipe I've never actually tried brass knuckles to be honest I know they have a great reputation I don't do a whole lot of baked pens [Music] you pet my dog oh I'm gonna do it so yeah I don't review some wanna gummies I would like to I've had people ask me to review some wanna gummies but I have not seen it any actually in any of the dispensaries I wonder if they're just not sort of in Orange County or in Los Angeles County but I will review them as soon as I've seen them because I had a lot of people do them I've never heard of Stillwater teas but if I do find Stillwater artis I will review them because I am very I'm always interested in the beverages I always like reviewing the beverages so if I find the Stillwater cheese I will definitely review those as well ooh they also tested positive for pesticides and Capra what were you asking if if what tastes good oh brass knuckles so yes and I've got two dog O's in here actually Michael II and both of them need pets and they're both scratching leaving to play timesplitters and get baked with a buddy all right man I will oh it does it does kappa yes it tastes great dude the the back oh sorry I keep me and my camera assembly told me before that he was making a motion sick yes that that's new and it did look like she was being left out she's a she's a needy needy dog and Brendon real quick if you haven't left yet are you playing like timesplitters on the ps2 timesplitters like that's crazy that game was amazing back in the day by TimeSplitters - so good timesplitters 3 did it ever get made I can't remember but I'm a big fan of the timesplitters go play enjoy all right guys it's may be time for a little bit more of the bottle let's see what's gonna happen here yeah yeah yeah yeah oh sweet dude playing some time splitters on the Gamecube how classic how very 2002-2003 of you have fun man I I still have that wackadoodle but uh I got you I got you Beeston timesplitters was an awesome game times learners to also was an awesome game time slitters to to was amazing okay here we go a little bit more syrup already crazy high not looking forward to this tastes really gross here we go Oh Michael that's so cool buddy I'm glad I didn't know you were the guy from reddit welcome man I'm so glad I'm so glad you made it to the stream and I'm glad you recommended it because somebody else I appreciate it and I'm sorry for those gross noises I was making I know it was really getting off Derby man earlier so I was giving a little bit extra a little acting for him but how much do I like reddit wheats well I've been taste wheaty or just cough syrup II it tastes like both unfortunately it has the UM like the sort of alcohol II burning taste of a cough syrup and then the bed her ass Arabic you know unmistakable cannabis taste as well so the worst of both worlds is the way I'd like to describe it I need a chip I need a chip how do I deal with the parent that crazy paranoia of edibles I do get there only only after being crazy crazy crazy high so I really get that high anymore but if I do I I try to just go to sleep the last time that that happened was probably the last time I did one of these challenges um the Korova black bar after about three and a half hours I got so high I was crazy high I needed I had to like go lie down and I wasn't I wasn't explaining how paranoid I was in the street but I was I was getting quite paranoid and ultimately just was like okay gotta go chill because this is this this is too much but to answer a edison's question how much I like reddit it's ok um I I don't I'm not a great self advertiser I don't like advertising myself I don't like having to go out there and sell myself I hate doing social media I've recently I recently just started really pushing Facebook and Twitter following me on Facebook and Twitter right there follow us on Facebook and Twitter just recently and read it's a little bit it feels a little less shameless we know if there's a little bit I don't know it feels shameless and gross all around but but it's it's a necessary part of the business but I do like reddit it's a quick community for sure I like going there I don't like having to advertise on reddit but I like the community and I like reading reddit but you know it's a it's a part of part of the game I guess oh and your tolerance is only around 90 milligrams that's pretty nice I wish mine were that low oh wow the answer depends less than 10 milligrams if only I will be doing 100 times that today oh my god it's Church those trips so good I do dab often I I don't have as much as I hate but I have I don't actually have a dab rig I have a nectar collector which I like I like using the nectar collector a lot it's a lot I find a lot less messy than a traditional gab rig and I'm kind of scared of torches I mean you stop to have a torch for a nectar collector but I feel like it's less cumbersome using the nectar collector method and I feel like I'm less likely to burn the house down Oh as an email setup is that one of the setups that are constantly running like the ones that you basically plug into the wall that's always on and you just put your nail on there and it's good to go what would I say is my most ideal dose milligram wise well it depends on the product I would say a slightly less than one hole 250 milligrams Kanaka bar or kirova cookie or something oh sweet dude yes I think I know what those are I've seen there some places out here now a kapa that will basically let you do dabs in in the in the store at the dispensary I've seen three different dispensaries have dab breaks it up and they all have email setups it's pretty cool I've done some dabs off of those although I think that that is probably not legal but I've done some dabs from those and those setups are super super cool and oh my god guys I am already I'm already getting crazy I don't see how much we have left we've got about Oh what would you say a little less than half to go I think oh no it's a little more than half because we're at know a little less than half a little less than half okay good good when I dab I sweat so hard and coughs a bad I can't do it I mean when I do it's like super high yes I used to be really bad about the coughing with dabs I've gotten better about finding like the perfect sort of size for my lungs but but yeah I still I still occasionally get way to cough way too much to take away too much and cough like the next 15 minutes and start sweating and I start watering the whole the whole deal but but but I've gotten better about figuring out exactly where my sort of sweet spot is again my favorite way of smoking or you know in not smoking it's vaping is it's volcano volcano if you want to pay me to say that you can I love the volcano it's a great product guys also really sad if you look next to my volcano up on top of the gumball machine my pineapple just ran out of batteries you were not afraid of taking a thousand milligrams this challenge oh I was terrified I am terrified at the very beginning of this stream I was here being like guys I don't know if I can do this I think I'm gonna pass out I don't know if I've got what it takes so in almost a half gram death that's pretty big that's pretty big it's not the biggest but but no no no that's smooch yeah a half 0.3 gram dab is huge that's giant because you can buy I'm thinking in terms of the size of flour yeah in terms of dabs that's that's outrageously big good luck man I'm I'm glad you I'm glad you made it through because I think that's a lot my math is my mathematical skills are beginning to beginning to decline in here unfortunately um my god I'm gonna need this caffeine this is wild um to sort of explain what's going on I'm I'm at the point where I'm having some levels of visual not necessary hallucinations but things are at the edges I'm not sure actually I'm not sure what the most I would have done it ones probably somewhere in the range of what Kappa has done I'd say less than that I don't think I've ever come close to doing a half gram I would so probably 0.2 1.15 something like that would be the biggest but I don't know for sure what would I like to see legalized recreational let's get some let's get somewhere on the East Coast a good bastion a good a good spot on the East Coast to legalize recreational let's do something like North Carolina they have the Research Triangle there so they have like a sort of liberal smart kind of you know more hippyish base there lots of good choice for months but we're not small and Vermont already has a reputation for being crazy you know super liberal and everything in Vermont's gonna if it doesn't already I would like to see yeah I'm gonna go with North Carolina it does North Carolina has a crazy unfortunate super conservative well they have the Democrat governor now they have a liberal governor so that's helpful this is just wishful thinking because I think North Carolina would be like a domino state and if they got it things like Georgia Tennessee might start to consider it so I'm gonna I'm gonna stick with my rejoins there and go North Carolina that's a final answer Alex no it not Alex Reva Regis what state will legalize recreational ass Mississippi Mississippi is my answer wait Massachusetts in Maine is ME Maine I can't

mspaint it's beautiful I did not mean to say that you're nug looked like a poop in any way shape or form but but I really appreciate it and I will consider it it's not it's a it's actually you know it's it's um it's it's maybe better than the current W I have up there it's certainly more representative than pineapples now that my pineapple lamp is busted and Michael yeah I am so sorry you're finding this difficult to masturbate to let's see if I can find something maybe if I do one of these derpy turd oh what a good pun pun what a good pun there's something I can't I'm too high to come with puns now I usually love puns puns are normally my bread and butter but I am too high to be coming up high and Edison asked it do I think I can function very well while high the answer to that question is you tell me because I am super high and am i functioning I'm not sure I'm definitely something yes thank you for sharing did the man if anybody else wants to share some artwork you can send it right to me and I will definitely share it with somebody with everybody else let me see if I can make you guys managed moderators these users can remove comments which can appear by blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah how do I make you guys I should make a discord chat channel I will do that I will work on that that is a let's add it to the list guys here we go to do's and then I'll tell you all about my cool notebook isn't this gonna be fun here we go making it right here make oh Jesus [ __ ] make a discord channel can I describe how high I am right now the edges of my vision are starting to blur a little bit like I can feel my peripheral vision starting to close in a little bit I am superstone I wouldn't say visually hallucinating that is not the way that I am would describe it but it's not far off like I keep seeing things to the sides I feel like I'm sort of in the living kind of two seconds in the past right now like everything I'm saying is something that I'm now experiencing in the past like I haven't yet formulated what I've said and I now that I I'm only now understanding it when I'm hearing it like oh [ __ ] I can't believe I just said that like how cool is it what I just said headache no headache no headache whatsoever feel physically fine Rocka says you should eat two handfuls of deep carved weed with no flavoring or beverage from an entire stick of butter for fat oh that would be disgusting but I should that sounds like an experiment probably not gonna do it I am super soon so yes it's like everything I'm experiencing everything slightly in the past and I'm not even saying what I'm saying and I'm only realizing what I'm saying after it is escaped my mouth and then it's like man I can't believe I just said that how cool is that so I hope that sums up for you how high I am I'm glad my dogs are here they're ignoring me they're sleeping oh nice half of Korova three-dose pretty good that's how the pilgrims got high so what was I saying what was I talking about somebody's got to remind me oh it doesn't matter what I was talking about cuz I'm gonna be talking about something different right now I'm gonna be talking about my look guys this notebook is so cool I just wrote this in so look at all these notes I have in here these are scripts for upcoming yes I do I make fire crackers Ben s nice kappa nice diesel OG crumble is super nice a lot of those are scripts for upcoming weeks things but the cool thing about this notebook the thing that i was like oh i have to share something with you is you can use these FriXion pens the erasable pens I mean that's fun in any notebook you can use the erasable pens the cool thing about this notebook is it's all super erasable because you can microwave it erase everything in here if you use those goddamn FriXion pens you put a little cup of water on that little a little circle there and a little cup of water flip it over put a little cup of water here for 30 seconds each time and erases all the ink and you can use it again like new and if you look at the very bottom in these little tiny symbols I don't know how well they're showing up but you can see those little symbols you just check through it you just X through it and then when you you can take a picture on this notebook with that little dotted paper lines because you can see it's got these little like graph paper dots it helps to scan you see you scan it it's wave wave it's awesome and you scan it and then it goes directly like you determine what folder you want to send it to so I say like oh this symbol means email it goes directly to your email this symbol means iCloud notebook it goes directly to your iCloud notebook super cool super dope I like writing stuff in notebooks physically still so I it's super super help for me just guy who maintains skunk number one since he's taken 45 hundred milligrams of THC and it's day before holy [ __ ] oh my god how would you the most I would have done is probably about 1200 no less than that they've done it a thousand milligrams well uh today today I will have done 12:40 I will have done 12:40 at the end of today because I will have done this oh [ __ ] unless I'm on the side of drink guys I'm gonna need more drink okay let's uh skype man Sam I like the name I like his name skunk man 10 what a dope ass name let's check some stats before we drinks more liquid okay guys what we are now one hour and five minutes into the stream I've done a little bit over a half of the SERP sizzurp and I listened to almost exclusive oh oh that would be um Oh derby men sent us a new link ooh a lot better a lot better that definitely looks more Nuggets here I'll send it I'll share it with everybody again I like it a bit I like it I like it a lot here is raucous listens to bluegrass indie kappa what kind of indie music do you listen to I listen to pretty much exclusively indie stuff my favorite band of all time don't laugh would be the shins my second favorite band of all time would be the National slash Jason is Bowl bluegrass I like the I like bluegrass I like Steep Canyon Rangers a whole lot that they're great I don't listen to enough bluegrass traditionally but I do like it I love folk recently I've been listening to a sort of non-stop Waxahachie watt walks are hot I had no idea how to say her name so so so good but yeah I listened to a bunch of stupid [ __ ] I guess you would call it but I love stupid [ __ ] I don't have Spotify believe in rot I use Apple music because I'm a sucker I'm a dweeb so yeah I use Apple music that is I thought I thought is nug was beautiful too man I thought it was super super beautiful I don't think I can make any of you guys like cool people until I get super chat which I don't get until I have a thousand subscribers so we need to get a thousand subscribers so I can get super chat so I can make everyone here a moderator so you can all post your own links to chat and not get flagged as spam now wouldn't that be great wouldn't that be I deal okay um geez Louise I just cannot believe I have to do another half of this let's see what else would I would I say I'm experiencing Oh guys guys did I I might have mentioned this in the beginning of this stream this is a spoiler so you still have to watch this review coming up probably not for about like three four or five six weeks something like that but you got to watch still oh no here comes a burp oh god I'm sorry ah I'm gonna fart I'm really high um I love Rick and Morty I have not seen episode six just yet I am very much looking forward to seeing it who doesn't love Rick and Morty it's almost as good as community that's all I got to say about that guys I didn't have a very first CD oh my god ruckus that is amazing what if our mouths farted in our butts burped life would be incredible if that were the case could you nuts imagine walking around and instead of just been like you know going so you would oh my god life would be so funny if I ever don't think farts are funny I want somebody to just end me you know because farts which should always be should and always will be incredibly funny and if I ever don't find a fart funny then I then there's something I've gone a Benilde III also houston pour one out for for Houston and in the spokes they're affected by hurricane Harvey that's really terrible actually not to yes I am high as hell I am crazy hi guys as I was saying before if I weren't doing this week's live right now I would be playing Mario Plus Rabbids on the switch do you any of you guys have a switch man I am so so happy with that console yeah about five hundred and fifty milligrams are I've imported anything raucous good point maybe too soon but damn good point out I have really brought the tone down here is there a point where you can't get any higher with edibles like you can by smoking it I don't I've gotten to the point where I green out once so I mean you will eventually pass out Michael ye I've only ever done it once like truly passed out that was the very first time I ever made firecrackers I told the story several times before very briefly I did firecrackers make firecrackers for the very first time from a BB emitted about half an hour I went to go pick up some food was waiting in line hit me like a goddamn sledgehammer right between the eyes could barely make it home didn't even manage to put the food in the refrigerator before passing out on the couch welcome to like four to six hours later still high as [ __ ] do I ever think I will be eventually become successful I don't know I'm not doing it to be successful I don't really care if I ever become super successful oh I would appreciate that yeah well I mean true the reason I'm doing it honestly was I was tired of getting ripped off with edibles I'm just so so tired of because I like trying different things I always like experimenting with different levels trying different things finding cool new interesting products so that was part of it but then I realized I was getting ripped off all the time experimenting on new things and I was just you know letting these companies get away with it and so I thought man instead of just letting other people get ripped off maybe I should make do something about it and just like make reviews on YouTube sharing with people letting them know which ones are actually worth your money because these things are expensive these things are very expensive you it totally sucks to spend 20 bucks on something to think you're gonna have a great fun night and then you know you eat it in two hours later you don't feel anything so that's why I'm doing it the only reason I would ever hope for it to get big would be that you know it saves more people more money more people don't get ripped off by the shadiest [ __ ] companies out there but I'm not like dying for it to get huge but the more exposure the better because the more exposure it gets the more likely people are to not get ripped off by shitty companies what what is my favorite firecracker recipe ruckus my favorite firecracker recipe was was precisely this I don't know how much avb was in it a [ __ ] ton um probably something like five grams actually in this one firecracker but it was graham cracker natural all-natural peanut butter five grams of a BB a smidge of coconut oil just a very small smidge of coconut oil nutella some more the other half of the a BB excuse me the other half of a VP then the Nutella then another graham cracker in the oven excuse me wrapped tightly in aluminum foil in the oven at for 300 at 320 degrees for 22 minutes that's my favorite recipe does mean great all the time yes I'm so glad I stopped everybody from buying lol edibles and and that's I'm going to be doing a review of them of them explicitly in the future because I feel like they deserve a target they deserve people knowing explicitly not to be purchasing from them because they're as we get in terms of first name wheats has no first name wheats is an institution I don't actually use your first name we don't use any names here on weeds the reason being is in the future we might have more wheats hosts I might even pass the reins on to other people at some point and everybody will only ever be on this channel as wheats or wheats cohost number X there will never be like a person on here and with with being named because wheats is an institution as we like to say and we'd like to say that as of this moment so I hope that oh thanks Jeremy man that came direct from China I think we found it on like I keep me in the goddamn sorry I keep don't mind to see there's some people like goddamn that came directly from China space curtain took about two weeks to get here only cost like twelve dollars and like Alibaba or something it smelled like [ __ ] for two weeks because of whatever chemicals they used to diet but now it's totally cool now it's this cool space curtain on the back and now we also have this dry-erase thing and this pillow curtain and all those pineapples well we're really uh Kappa oh I'm not going anywhere Kappa I'm not going anywhere trust me that's just theoretical theoretical in the future type stuff but way way way way way way way off in the future but ruckus well where are you where you located we'd love to have some more co-hosts if you're if you're anywhere near the area or if you want to produce some independent content just email me a tweets reviews at gmail.com and we can talk we can maybe set something up and I will stop trying to nee my desk so that I don't shake the camera I know isn't that weird Cleveland Oh Cleveland what kind of edible presents you get out there in Cleveland ruckus do you do import stuff from other states or do you make homemade stuff what do you do I'm not sure how do you how do you survive what do you do for your edibles out there in Cleveland ruckus I'm genuinely curious because I know some people some people in this very stream in fact who do send importation of their edibles which I find so fascinating and so cool and I just genuinely curious oh sweet your medical system starts this time next year that is really cool hopefully they're going to be very very generous with who they allow in their their legal system okay I think it's time for Derby man let's talk again guys if you have recommendations if you have anything you want to add to the show or talk to you about the show I'd love to hear from you I'd love to talk with you email me weeds reviews wheats reviews at gmail.com and we'll talk in the future I promise you I know I need to try to do some baking I'm terrible terrible at it I also have a very bad kitchen for it I don't have a good kitchen for like recording to set up stuff but I have thought about in the past trying to find I know some people who are good at cooking and oh that's really cool I didn't know that ruckus that's really cool kappa of course of course we can make all of these things happen again we will will well we'll use these things just review me email me weeks reviews at gmail.com we'll make some wool we'll figure out some ways to collaborate make wheats a bigger better experience for everyone I think now is have I ever made my own edibles before firecrackers I have tried to make some edible as other than firecrackers but have ended only in total and complete failure so the answer is no it's hard to say about bud reviews or even the concentrate reviews maybe we do a wheat spin off because wheats the term the name wheats is we eat like we'd eat you know like one absolute time I no no no no no never at just like all at one time 500 milligrams the most of your done in just like one you know one go a ruckus nice it's the most okay it's taken me two hours before although I will done this probably yeah in about two hours guys I have to go grab something to drink while to help me wash this down so I will be right back I've never smoked out of a wood pipe derby man actually so I guess I gotta say glass but only because I think it was it's the only thing I've ever experienced okay guys I'll be right back play the trip any music to you to yourselves be right back I have returned with an adorable little baby for the plumber a little a little my dogs are opening the door yes guys it's an Arizona tea but baby-sized okay.what back in the chat what it's my opinion so far on the product do I think it is as strong as the black box in Korova no hell no it is actually not as strong as I thought it would be granted I'm only about I've had only half of it so far we're a little bit more than half and it has only been it's been less than 90 minutes and I've only had you know I haven't had all half I haven't had the half of it that entire 90 minutes either it's still not as strong as I the crib a black bar but it's definitely you know there's there's it's it's not lacking in potency it's just not nearly as strong as the as the black bar I would say at this point Oh literates and pants take care bud thanks so much for watching man I appreciate it okay guys let's do a little bit more it is time to drink a little bit more of this scissor here not looking forward to it at all on the count of three three two one whoo the answer is how much however much I could get through which is quite a lot there's very little left we're almost done I'm almost done I will finish it very soon ruckus next time nice to get through let's let this little next a little bit hit us and then we will finish the bottle and then we'll stick around for a little bit and then I'm gonna go play some Mario Plus Rabbids Mario Plus Rabbids guys I notice that yes I will get super super high if you haven't guys I hate to beat a dead horse and beat the drum rub it in your eyes I should should rub it right you know I should put it in oil as red to say something but chug a second bottle hey ruckus I'll have you know I come from but chug University sir I come from the University of Tennessee which funny story I had a lot of friends at UT or I had a lot of friends in Knoxville who came to the area to go to the Oakridge the big national laboratory that made the atom bomb out there so a bunch of PhDs working out at Oak Ridge we're buddies of mine and they all asked like oh you know where'd you go to school or whatever now is it say I went to the University of Tennessee and they'd always go oh the butt chuggin school Oh Leonard Dobie man thanks so much for watching buddy how much time have we got left I'll probably say we're gonna be doing this but least for another hour so we mean I guess but I don't know I do not know as long as I can I'm sweet about you around huh Catholic you gotta come quick women months into all that money dude you gotta stop ingesting all that roundup you know you got to move over and try some weed be gone you know at least spread the love a man's gotta eat that is true I'll eat one of these delicious potato chips in your honor right now kettle chips spicy queso no I don't think I'm gonna pass out I can't guarantee it but I might man i-i've never I'm only as I said I'm only really so hot by SFL oh I've only ever kind of passed out once and it wasn't really passing out I made it to the couch I lied down and fell asleep but it was definitely like oh god oh god oh god this is uncomfortable and as soon as I was on the couch as soon as I was in a you know fetal position I was out and I was out like a light for somewhere between four to six hours or something so i've never blacked out from drinking or anything close to it but you know i assumed it was probably something similar in terms of like oh god I need to go to sleep that kind of thing no of course I'm open to all kinds of co-hosts on wheats the co-host the co-host co-host co-host wheats co-host co-host me his name is co-host is is is it can only do it infrequently unfortunately but we definitely have other guests and things on as as schedules permit if you ever would like to be on or anything just send me a review a tweets reviews at gmail.com and we can dock oh my god a nine gram mega to it oh and your point three gram jab on 4/20 I unfortunately didn't get too high on 4/20 of this year mostly because the year before that I lost a bid on a house cuz I got way too high on 4/20 and then I was so sad a year later that I please do please do by all means either Lee insist I'd love to love to chat with you um I hope Derby man's eatin some good food for all of us because now I'm getting the munchies Michael asking the big great questions what are the dogs names the dogs names I've got three three dogs to a Border Collie a border collie mix and a Great Dane the border collie the black and white one his name squid the blond one the small one the border collie mix her name's Newt and then the Great Dane who has not been in here her name is frog [ __ ] I'm hungry too I think we're all getting hungry and now I'm getting everybody the munchies unfortunately and I'm just thinking like what am I gonna eat there's so many choices there's so many great choices for what to eat this evening you know what is a bender though and I'm gonna bum everyone out we do not have unlike every other Sunday at this point we don't have a game of thrones to look forward to at the end of this evening no I've never seen CCC 4:20 I might have to I might have to check them out actually I am bad at YouTube uh yeah I would assume that probably is because we are Stone I'm bad at YouTube I actually don't I don't subscribe to anybody on YouTube I don't actually I use my I think YouTube's feed technology or they're like feed system is incredible because the more I'm on YouTube the more I'm on YouTube because like they're always feeding me great videos and things I want to watch I never thought I I really never thought I would be into like watching YouTube videos but it's getting its hooks into me so I probably will at some point become into you get into - and start like subscribing to things but for a long time I mostly just used it to watch you like Stephen Colbert clips and Seth Meyers clips like they're really obnoxiously political stuff which I love and but now I'm watching all kinds of great things on YouTube including guys I'm there oh [ __ ] that's a lot of subs Wow Wow you need to check them out see what they're doing right as you might have noticed I've incorporated some drone footage I got a DJI a spark and I've got a DJI Matic on the way because you know once you get one there's so much [ __ ] fun that's all you want to do yeah drones are awesome we're gonna have more drone footage in our videos and stuff just as like b-roll and in in the future mostly because I just think drones are fun putting them in actual videos is probably obnoxious but [ __ ] are they fun - are they fun to fly around which is probably why you've seen some unnecessary drone footage in my videos as of late my reviews as of late again I am so sorry for being obnoxious I think I've already said this once I don't remember I'm very high I'm very high so if I've already beaten this in I apologize make sure that you are following me on Facebook and Twitter because I actually started using them very heavily recently posting updates and things of letting people know the schedules when I do my tolerance break starting next Monday September 11th I will hopefully start doing like a several times a week vlog just nothing I like that term but just explaining my experience sort of going through like oh guys this is how its experimenting blah blah blah blah blah all that fun stuff so look out for that and of course I'll be shooting with some drones there because again it's just fun to do so I'm not sure I was talking about before that but again follow me Facebook and Twitter if you don't we a tweets reviews in both places that way you just don't miss any of that stuff as I post it men you guys have me really wanting to watch this CCC 420 because you seem really remorseful that it's gone and it sounds like a cool channel I'm going to look it up right now as we're speaking which is rude of me CCC 420 dab the logic I see oh no oh yeah it looks like they don't really post that much anymore which is unfortunate you think what that many subs you'd uh you be totally a crutch 420 I'm not I mean I don't watch a lot of weed videos to be honest I know I need you to really sort of get in the community I don't watch as much as I should but what do I think of custom girl 420 I know exactly what I think a question girl 420 and I'm that's you to beauty was say what's up YouTube YouTube yes up YouTube u2's that's what I think of custom grow 420 love them well everybody if you're out there you're not you definitely not I need to watch more weed channels than I do I don't watch enough I mostly still watch Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers clips oh and if you guys don't watch Vsauce you need to be watching Vsauce actually right now just go ahead and open up another tab go ahead and type in Vsauce not Vsauce 2 or vsauce3 just the og original Vsauce just go to popular uploads and just go go get nice and high after this and and have your mind blown crutches decent 10k oh my god Jesus Christ I did not know that that is a lot of money there's a lot of money $10,000 I guess when you have over a million subscribers you know you can do whatever you want or whatever that's that is that is outrageous that is truly outrageous yeah that but that seems crazy but he can go but he could say YouTube's better than anybody for sure yeah once you start saying it oh really whose private property was he trespassing on I wonder I wonder who where and he got arrested for it it must have been trespassing on some pretty 10k in cash to smoke with him what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] who would leak who has that amount of money that doesn't find him I don't know that's just that's crazy that is crazy good for him I guess uh see that makes sense didn't even get busted because it was if it was actually owned by the state that makes a lot more that likes a lot more sense than if or just some personal person's property the state always going to get its vengeance it's pound of flesh of course it's not worth it to smoke with them for $10,000 it's not worth knowing to smoke with it for $1,000 now it might be with him to smoke with that for $100 just for the I'm for the exposure but but any more than that you know I know well I would saw if you guys want any I want this for anybody if anybody wants I'll make a video for you where I go you to you for you and you can i I'll do it for free all right guys should I go ahead and finish this off let's do it let's just finish it off let's let's let's end this baby and then let's hang out for another hour or so here we go three two one Wow that went down the wrong pipe we broke a went down the wrong right

with a wholesale level next time I have the opportunity which should hopefully be pretty soon so guys um how I'm feeling at this moment incredibly high it is definitely coming on strong right now my vision is sort of funneling even more than it was before oh right yes for medicinal use only I got you buddy nice emoji usage so yeah it's coming on really high my vision is sort of funneling it even more I have that feeling of living in the past my throat is sort of harshing my buzz a little bit I don't know what happened definitely I would actually say so I singed my throat with that last little bit going down has not been fun but this is actually been a pretty fun trip I'm not at all a paranoid hype not at all like uh I don't yet feel too high I don't feel oh man my throat Jesus maybe guys with one don't drink this much sure ever in this short amount of time that's just foolish that's just foolish and be careful if you do because it seems like you can make your throat a little bit tender unfortunately is that is the way mine feels right now it feels it feels a little on the Scourge side Oh Ben you know I do what I can but in terms of my high I feel pleasantly stone let's see I'm at about an 8 right now and and rising not uncomfortably high yet still in the pleasant range mostly a cerebral high nothing I'm not really feeling it in the body at all no no body effects no like body buzz or anything right now mostly just a cerebral hi smart kappa smart didn't no one can do that so yeah I've been doing it but it's it does a number on the throat or I don't know if I just got it going down the wrong pipe there at the end but my throat is finally starting to come back around to an acceptable level have I ever tried a hemp blunt to wrap I don't believe that I have it is that just a paper that is a blunt paper made from hemp I'm guessing it's probably pretty nice I would think but I've never tried one so good for the throat [Music] by the way I'm still playing a shit-ton a fortnight I am I cannot stop playing for tonight I'm probably hey welcome back I totally recommend it I know it's not for everyone the game can be a bit of a grind it can definitely be a lot of a grind but it's fun I see have been copping a hell of a lot yeah I got some some of this stuck in mine through it we finished this I don't know if you were here when I finished it it's all gone but I burned the throat on the wash a little bit down unfortunately oh that's pretty cool no it just just got caught in my throat on the way that it doesn't like a hell of a good deal kappa yeah just got cutting my throat on the way down no smoking just when finishing it just and made my throat burn yep that's it as I said while you're gone can new record most THC in one day and fastest THC can fastest consumed and went to 1,000 milligrams did that all in 90 minutes and I had 1240 grams of THC today well very high about 1/8 I would say right now what it was what I was saying earlier I'd say 8 is a pretty accurate reflection speech getting slurred having a tough time remembering what I was just talking about I still enjoying the high sylheti the highest still and enjoyable high still jonesing to play Mario Plus Rabbids Kingdom battle really hate those [ __ ] Rapids though really hate those goddamn Rapids like seriously why did they think that anybody wanted Rabbids oh nice dude kappa this dad is four III do not know I do not know anything about wholesale purchases almost done with the coughing I think I'm very stoned too but we're all very stone together which is a wonderful uniting feeling kirova is so goddamn strong i forgot which one you got what what what flavor of 150 milligrams the three dose did you get that is awesome kappa you are you do your research shirt you do your research wait wait Edison what Oh ginger - yes my favorite - love the ginger - I love the ginger - it's so good I love molasses cookies the jr. - is just so good so so good I'm going to eight and climbing i would say and i keep saying edison because I don't want to mispronounce your first name can you can you help me is there like a a rhyme guide you can give me Edison to help pronounce your first name just cuz I want to make sure I get it correct just say sounds like rhymes with something like that give me some hints here that would be kind of you sir Mario plus rabbit's kingdom battles more imma imma more I'm Addison more i'ma where does more i'ma come from if you don't mind me asking where I'm up that's a great name I like it a lot or imma push my name with that ending hmm I can hear my Great Dane barking you probably could do more i'ma so wherever there's more i'ma come from and that that makes subtle sense with how I'm seeing it there that's I think how I would have guessed it would have said the frowns I I might have said more rain my action more I memories yeah so I'm glad I asked now I'm just having trouble remembering what I'm just talking about Mario Plus Rabbids great on the switch the switch is an awesome console if you who would have ever thought Nintendo would have made a great console again love it a lot Graeme's games great for tonight game is awesome looks currently reading the incredible book hey Jerrod welcome man glad they're glad you made it oh Nathaniel okay well welcome to Fanueil oh that's cool that's from an 80s show that is your mom's favorite character um that's a really cool story in fact and welcome to Jerrod we were just talking about something thank you who the [ __ ] knows something something great we're talking about Mariah and how to pronounce it it is an odd name yeah I like it it's a very very cool name and it's a cool cool one to use as it as a screen name because it's so unique I forgot what you're talking about we're talking about how high I am that's for sure Jerrod we actually already finished the bottle just a little while ago so that is a thousand milligrams I am my highest coming on strong Oh sing the name of the book pipe on thank you so much um oh okay well that makes total sense that you would need to keep that on the DL name of the book though and congratulations on getting your MD that is a wonderful accomplishment and a rare accomplishment and a fait great one and thank you so much for Pyatt pom for reminding me oh if that's how you say your name or P upon the name of the book I am reading almost finished with sapiens by you've all what is how do you pronounce his last name just a second this is an incredible book guys you've all arrived it's just a book about the history of Homo sapiens as the name sort of implies it's sort of just and oh yeah I am definitely super going to be super hi I'm already super high and going to be super high Earth than I am right now so it's a Wow a dispensary can sell no more than 8 ounces of cannabis okay so you even get a half pound seeing the half pound is the most you can get an a single day and clear Pam is the most I've ever sell seen sold to a at a dispensary I don't think I've ever seen a half pound being sold so read the book sapiens it's incredible has some it will sort of change your it's one of those rare books that is sort of paradigm-shifting and viewpoints the way it makes you think about humanity in the way it makes you think about the idea of the liberal democracy is sort of the end of history just incredible I utterly love it that again that sapiens by Yuval her I I think that's how you pronounce their name great book I just finished also the defenders on the old Netflix my partner and I just finished that we both would like to liked it okay we watched all the preceding Marvel shows other than Iron Fist which we gave up on and this one has the same problem that all the Marvel shows have which is it is so so so slow to start but takes you know it takes a long time to get off the ground once this one finally gets rolling it's fun it's fun it's it's not great it's not incredible by any stretch but it's fun and the fun sort of conclusion to some of those storylines and I really like really like Jessica Jones a lot just good Jones is great so the defenders is fun it's fun on Netflix just get recapping you guys or what I've been doing recently now all I can think about is what I'm going to be doing for the rest of your coming up no no I'm not feeling so nervous at this point I know I'm definitely gonna get higher and I haven't peaked yet either for sure I don't think I definitely gonna continue to get higher my throat is feeling a little better now so I think everything's gonna be okay I think everything's gonna be okay oh wow two hours to peak I or two hours to really get going I I'm usually I've usually peaked by two hours and I'm stirring I usually peak in about 90 minutes I would say and have usually started to come down by about two hours so and I just now hit the two hour mark from the first half of this bottle so I have a lot more to come on still so we shall see how high I get um but man I now all I can do this thing about food I got the munchies for Rizal's Kappa when you come into California if you make it into Long Beach I'm taking you out to MVPs buddy that is my go-to if you don't mind if you don't mind like meat that is because it's just a burger place but god damn it's the best burger place it's so good so so good I'm taking you out there if you ever come by we're actually if anybody anybody that's my offer anybody comes to visit sweets HQ and in Long Beach California I'll take you out to MVPs we'll go out for a burger together and we'll enjoy it we shall eat and be merry what'd you guys think of Game of Thrones finale last week I enjoyed it quite a bit it does I know there are a lot of problems with the most recent season there are a lot of them are self-evident I don't really need to go over them all right dude yo come on out dude kappa see you or you are just straight-up it great start to finish do you have any problems with the sort of temporality problems them the the the how how are they characters getting so are you are you have any problems with how like the characters are getting from point A to point B so quickly and motivations are sort of changing sure dude please do by all means yes that is a very sad thing for Kappa Kappa does not live in Cali and and has to get his edibles through other means as all will say as always she'll say he can reveal more if he chooses my god I had also asked earlier are there any specific companies not that you want me to review products of but companies in particular like the whole organization so they have to be big they have to be something that has a lot of products some diversity in their products to preferably can't be just like one chocolate bar and one dark chocolate bar has to be you know like they have several different kinds of products you know it can be all be brownies and cookies but they they have to have more than one thing I'm looking to do reviews of companies in particular I know we're all Tinley gonna try to do ones like you know Korova Kanaka lol edible of Voodoo sours cushy punch cannon candy is you know the bigger name brands and things of that nature but if there's some out there that I'm missing things that I'm just screaming out to you that you want me to review let me know and I'll be happy to do so to all those videos are going to take a lot more work than our traditional wheats reviews which is part of the the one month long this one month-long tolerance break that we will be doing here on wheats man so uh now the to explain my hi I oh my god it is starting to come on very very very incredibly strong it's hard just I'm barely even falling along and chat at this point I see Kappa and more I'm talking and conversing and having a good time but really following along that's pretty difficult to be honest it looks like they're having a lively lively conversation but I'm really not paying much of attention I'm just talking about my own things and guess at this point I don't eat another potato chip I think Ketel i'm degrading your brand by associating with marijuana come and get me come and get me um so um what else what else what guys kappa kappa i forgot you work in some capacity with a br or you have the are or what's the what's your BR vibes that's the I have not tried sundar storm Candy's I've not even heard of sundar storm candies but I'm looking them up right now thunder storm edibles canna candies [Music] ooh they got fancy packaging Oh I have seen these actually I have seen these around I have not picked them up because they are mostly just belts they have a lot of belts and I've never had a belt do anything for me other than keep my pants up but have you tried them kappa are they supposed to be good or are you just curious alright now that you brought them up i'll be happy to do them giving them a review but i've it just curious to know if what I'm in store for it or if I know if you know what I'm in store for yeah I've seen them I've seen that in a couple of dispensaries now that I've looked at their packaging their packaging looks nice I just have always passed them up because I've reviewed probably five different rain you know sour belts candies from different manufacturers and never had one that worked for me google them more I'm a yo-yo they're very pretty packaging that's very nice packaging I've seen them in a couple of places it's very Hindu looking but but I'll get my chance next time I see them they usually a good web presence is a good sign for how reliable and attaboys because you will often find that the shittier the company the less of a web presence it has which is perhaps not much of a surprise if you think about it but but I definitely noticed that as a correlation but like yep Simon beavers in the house welcome hey man I'm so glad you made it I'm glad you made it for the stream we have already finished slambien or as of about 20 minutes ago we finished the bottle we're waiting for the effects to really get here yes I agree this package the packaging does look relatively elegant and I am a sucker for nice packaging that's another thing that usually goes hand in hand with good edibles I have not tried dab Zilla or al Lancaster but I are they an edible brand or are they just a concentrate spread I'd be willing to give them a try because I like the name DAB Zilla so all our slime bener yeah already finished it super high probably animate half rising maybe nine who knows getting higher higher we've talked about a lot of things we've talked a lot about I can't get these kids to shut up about Mario plus rabbits Kingdom bill they're on the switch I'm like guys nobody gives a [ __ ] about Mario Plus rabbits nobody gives a [ __ ] about rabbits Michael EE thanks bud thank you so much for watching man I really appreciate you coming out and watching I appreciate you spreading the word we will we will see you on a later one buddy later man it does remind me a little bit of the infused creations packagings more I'm as well which has me a little worried but it does look fancier than that so it's you know it's not a total I don't want a toad that of a product I would definitely give them a chance and now that now that they've been brought up and I'm trying to remember I know I've seen that at least two dispensaries as I can go back to one and get up there um believe it or not we're all in Kessler I used to drink a little bit I've never been a huge drinker but I actually haven't well I took it back I had a couple of drinks for the first time maybe two or three weeks ago but I don't drink much I'm not a big drinker it I get sick pretty quickly from drinking like a couple of drinks I get I'm usually already like feeling pretty nauseous so I don't do it as often as as I might like cuz I get sick pretty easily from it but all right dude I understand I'm gonna have to leave pretty soon and get some food masu and yes I mean this weather has been so stupid it's so goddamn hot right now I did a review earlier today I was sweating like a madman it's $41 for a thousand milligrams Kentico good deal kappa that's a yes that's a good deal $45 is the nor is is the price i see it most often I've seen it you can if you look hard enough you can find 440 the cheapest I've ever seen it and I've only ever found out one dispensary at this price is 35 sounds good dude later man I am Not sure oh dude oh no oh no stay safe man that's terrible I mean I've heard about the the the Wildfire out there and how awful it is crazy weather we're having all across the country right now unfortunately what am I going to eat or Lancaster I haven't decided just yet there's a world of possibilities but it has to be within a segways ride from me or a mini segways right for me because that's all the farther I am willing to move and the only thing I can operate right now responsibly so that's that'll be my limiting factor is how far away it is segway ting right give it to me to wear Lana Castro gave me this yes ah all right man enjoy that pizza eat a slice for me eat a slice for me dude yes this hot weather has been brutal brutal brutal brutal brutal brutal even like the beach has been you know there hasn't even been a breeze to really sit salvage it or save it it's just been too [ __ ] hot but I am if I couldn't let pizza do guys we get start talking stop talking about food this is dangerous this is dangerous you're getting me you're getting me off off course here yeah give me give me give me one char give me like you know 55 degree days again give me hoodie weather give me lazy pants whether I want to wear sweatpants again you know I want to be I want to be a real a real lazy son of a [ __ ] and start wearing sweatpants again oh my god guys kappa [ __ ] you [ __ ] you oh my god I'm so high I'm so hungry I'm so hungry well we successfully finished this bottle yes winter and cloaked in quotations for sure slimy [ __ ] yes as winter as it can get in Southern California as Daniel Tosh once said like I think it was joke was something like people say you know when I say live in Los Angeles people say but I love the seasons I miss the seasons and he said yeah we have seasons too just not the shitty ones which is pretty true get full of can't you out of the dispensary freshmen I don't have any quarters Kappa I can't I don't have any queries I actually I'm genuinely curious to know how much money is in there because I we have laundry we won't have laundry in our unit there's there's laundry in the building we but it takes quarters so we don't have to go to pizzeria matzah oh that sounds so [ __ ] good dude okay I'm gonna be good I'm gonna be signing off soon guys just to let you know to

"otonHE9oklM": "all right i got more water we're gonna finish this last two packs of gums [Applause] oh [Music] foreign [Music] we're at 900. [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign and we did it thousand milligram edible challenge i'll give you guys give you guys an update video in about an hour or so but you guys know how i'm feeling", "WUaSrjjG1Gw": "a review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at another product from the fine fine folks at G Pharma labs and their liquid gold bars this time we are reviewing their 210 milligram ultimate milk chocolate bar this will be the third or fourth liquid gold product we've reviewed in the past I've enjoyed all of their bars both in terms of taste and potency they're never quite as good as like a kiva bar or maybe like duffel se but they are a good chocolate there's a little bit of cannabis taste to all the ones in the past but it's good quality chocolate and it always gets me nice and high this cost 15 bucks in my dispensary but I got a discount for two for 25 which is actually a pretty good deal 1250 for a 210 milligram chocolate bar that's a good deal you can't find much better than that so if you guys have never tuned in two weeks before the way our reviews work are pretty simple I'm gonna eat this chocolate bar it's not necessarily the whole thing in front of you but I'm gonna eat this chocolate bar up and then I'll actually come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review process so right behind me here guys is beautiful beautiful Long Beach I'm up here in Signal Hill California Long Beach I was gonna try to get some nice drone footage for you but apparently this is a no-fly zone according to the FAA and I can't fly my drone right beautiful aerial shots so bummer you guys are just gonna have to look at me face to face sorry I know that say so here we go we've got our bar here in hand opening up this foil maybe you know you would think after all of these reviews I would be an expert and opening up packaging but I still still suck at it all righty here we go here is our liquid gold bar six different pieces you can see the name written on it they're a liquid gold liquid gold liquid gold break1 off of this ultimate milk chocolate and give it a taste hmm well let's eat chocolate a little bit of a cannabis taste good again you're not gonna hate it the quality of chocolate really helps match that cannabis flavor it's not it's not huge it's just not as good it's like a keep a bar or some of the premier high-end chocolates um but it is good and guys in terms of taste just fine the most important thing though is how it's gonna make me feel for that guys you have to wait a couple of seconds me two hours and I'll come back to you guys and let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching wheats and I'll see you guys in just a bit two hours later welcome back to weed skies it has been two hours since I have enjoyed the liquid gold bar 210 milligrams ultimate milk chocolate seductive I don't know what makes it ultimate I'm guessing they don't have a regular milk chocolate doesn't matter just a solid product guys I mean just a damn solid product it's a good value it's good workhorse edible I have no problem recommending it you know it's um if you find it for like 15 bucks you're not gonna be disappointed with it you're gonna get nice and high you're not gonna hate the taste you know it's a good solid workhorse edible I've really enjoyed all the liquid gold I've reviewed I might do one more just to make sure but at this point it's pretty pretty pretty apparent that these guys know what they're doing and that you can grab a liquid gold bar and feel pretty satisfied with it so the ultimate milk chocolate you know which one's my favorite I don't know you know it's really there yeah they are all the chocolates pretty much consistent it's whatever flavor you think we would like the best from their lineup grab it grab it and go liquid gold as I said I might review one more maybe somewhere down the line but for now I think we're pretty consistent we know these guys know how to make a chocolate bar I would say I'm at a solid 7 right now somewhere right there so again I've only paid 1250 for this to 425 and that I mean it's just a good deal it's a good deal it's a good chocolate bar it's again a good it's not it's not the best that it's neither the best value and were the best tasting the edible out there but it's on the you know upper echelon its above average in in in each and in each realm so it's just a really good value I like it a lot that's the liquid gold bar ultimate milk chocolate 210 milligrams of THC I'm a fan of their stuff I'm a fan of their their chocolate bars been rambling enough thank you so much for watching wheats guys if you would do me a favor if you liked this video uh you know give me one of those little thumb yuppies subscribe if you haven't already and you know follow me on Twitter a tweets reviews and give me a like on the old Facebook also a tweets reviews that would that would help a lot thank you so much for watching wheats guys and we will check you out on a later review peace there's okay bye I see a lot of like farewells and goodbyes before I actually leave you but this time I really am gone see", "Fm_Zt96afF0": "attention i want my videos to look like this and not like this so if you're under the age of 21 and don't have a medical marijuana card leave what is going on you guys willow g here back again with probably my favorite video to date every day the videos get better and better and better and today today i got in a package from sumo heat and we got our second batch of edibles and this time there's a special edible in here you guys so i'm gonna be unboxing this we'll see what's inside here we're gonna open it up look at it together let's get right into this video i'm sorry [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] all right you guys i made the intro to this video so long ago probably over a week ago and i'm finally getting around to eating this thousand milligram willow g 1g edible right now it is 8 21 pm about a munch it i got a flight tomorrow probably at like four in the morning so it's gonna be interesting if i can get up in time let's see but here it is you guys pretty sweet my favorite color is green and it has green sprinkles so that was a nice touch but first bite [Music] cheers [Music] that tastes hella good all right we got some water so we're not just eating this by itself you know [Music] so in this edible there's supposed to be five different chocolates in there and i just took a fat ass bite of one of the chocolate chips and it didn't taste anything like weed because of it so in that case this might be nice [Music] the one thing i've realized already and i'm already like halfway through this edible is this tastes so much better than any thousand milligram edible or even like 500 mg edible i've i've ever had the cinnamon rolls that i ate for 2k which i may not even post anymore because it was kind of a lame video but i ate 2 000 milligrams of cinnamon rolls they tasted so shitty and um then the brownie the brownies on this channel that [ __ ] tasted like anus that if you look at the blooper video all these videos i'm gonna link them when i'm talking about them if you look at that blooper video and the end of the year video it is so [ __ ] funny the blooper reel at the end yeah next bite this tastes just like a good cookie it's pretty lit because after this i'm gonna play some switch just chill at the hotel room and for the next like two three hours just see how this is gonna kick because i really am excited to see if just like i go into a weed coma because of this edible and the craziest thing is is he can do an edible this big and he can taste good as [ __ ] what the [ __ ] it's been six minutes and i'm starting to feel it like i can kind of feel it [Music] hmm i have very fast metabolism as well you guys so i won't say i'm high yet because it's literally been like 10 minutes but like i can feel it going into my bloodstream and i can feel the cannabis like that's crazy [Music] all right cheers to that [Music] nice all right got about that much left started out with about that much so i'll tell you guys what you're gonna feel these if anybody wants a willow g1g hit me up or hit sumo heat up and i will make sure that you guys can get one i'm pretty sure he's selling them i don't know if he has a website but his ideas for surely going to be in the bio it's sumo heat literally sumo heat one word really easy um he's the biggest homie i swear to god [Music] one thing i gotta say you guys that's just like insane because i just went and refilled my water and looked at how long it's been recording last time i had like two to three bites left of the thousand milligram edible it was probably almost 50 minutes into the video it hasn't even been 10 minutes still since i started filming yeah 8 31 it's been 10 minutes now fight number one out of three let's go [Music] kind of zoned out there i'm getting pretty high wow bite number two out of three let's do this [ __ ] here we are you guys at the final bite of this edible it has now been 15 minutes since we started this video taking the final bite this is the best thousand milligram edible i have er i would just say high high milligram uh edible that i've ever had it tastes good it's low-key already hitting like i already zoned out during the video and it's been 15 minutes so i think like two hours in i'm just gonna be sky high and i'm kind of hyped for it so cheers thank you again sumo heat make sure you guys are following him make sure you support in the man go get yourself some edibles cheers just crumbs just like that edibles done let's see how high we get i will see you guys 20 to 30 minutes [Music] all right listen up i'm not high yet but it's been about 30 minutes since i started the video and i remembered i left like half a joint outside hidden because i ran inside to make a video real quick and uh i couldn't make it so i just sat around the hotel hella forgot about it and i just gotta get my key card so i can get back and we're gonna go smoke that joint real quick and then we're gonna come back and see how we're feeling see if it makes edible kicking all right listen up we found the joint it's dark we got the freeway in the background we're sitting up on some [ __ ] like pinwheels in the middle of the parking lot and i'm about to spark up this joint let's do it we got people sitting there's a little balcony to get in and there's three dudes in there getting drunk we got two people to the right of me getting high as well so we're all just having fun tonight it's a friday night why not but cheers you guys i'm gonna smoke the rest of this and i will update you guys in a little bit if i'm feeling the edible or whatnot all right update time it's been about an hour and a half since i ate the edibles and i'm feeling pretty good sitting here gaming right now with the boy oh and we got to pour a holo running add me on switch i'll put my code in the thing i don't know it but i'm gonna update you guys as i go to bed um i don't think i'll get much higher but it's a very nice like face high head high you know [Music] all right you guys we're at the airport now we're with mama og and papa ogi but um just watch the 100 milligram edible had to toss the other two sadly but shout out again sumo edible for making the willow g1g happen um if you guys want to hit him up again subscribe follow like comment all the socials are in the the bio we going to georgia peace [Music] you", "YurzDui9D5k": "hey you guys welcome back to my channel so today is actually 4/20 I have not done anything yet because yeah I just got back home so you know whatever but now we're here together and we're going to eat an edible that I have not eaten before and I really wanted to try this because I saw a video about it and then I was like a hot chocolate edible like does it really taste like hot chocolate um I'm a big fan of chocolate I love chocolate I love cookies I love brownies I'm all about chocolate so when I saw this I was like oh yeah I totally want to try this you know so I went into sensory and I think it's kind of a tradition of Mines that I always eat an edible on 4/20 I usually don't buy edibles just because I'm more of like a smoker person today I'm going to be reviewing the law fam\u00edlia cannabis choc a cannabis infused chocolate bar okay and this is in the flavor hot chocolate as you can see I love the packaging the color is so beautiful this is um this is a legit legit product so yeah it has basically all of your like serving suggestions and ingredients and it tells you like dosage and directions and it says to wait two hours for effects before consuming more so this is 100 milligrams I've had edibles that were literally like three 400 I think the most I've done is probably 300 milligrams and I probably like shared it with somebody so it's probably like a hundred and fifty that I did you know if I'm guessing right you know right so on the back right here it basically has its tested for life parasites and stuff EHC is nine point zero seven per serving so I already opened it up for you guys so you guys can check it out so for like each little name it's like it tells you like cuz I'm guessing the bars the bar looks like this and ten milligrams ten milligrams ten milligrams so for each serving is like ten milligrams 10.30 for CBD per package so I guess the whole package now most likely if I really enjoy this I'm probably gonna just eat all of it or I might just eat half of it I really don't know if I don't really like it I might just eat half of it and they say the other half are like tomorrow I don't know so when you open it up it comes in like this little Ziploc bags so if you don't want to eat it you know like all of it then you can totally store it yeah and then on here it basically like it's the same stuff it has like the ingredients this is Matt this is total sugars of 56 grams so and this does have like it has nonfat milk so if you know you don't consume dairy just FYI so I'm ready to [ __ ] taste this so I watched a video and they said to like do something like this and then it opens it up oh oh oh okay I'm kind of getting like a weed edge smell they they smell like chocolate and then like kind of like the Abuelita the hot chocolate the Mexican one and yeah so let's just get into it right let's just try one so this is basically 20 milligrams a one oh wow I am so sorry for my smacking I was oh my god Wow so it's literally literally it's like you know when you like eat like a chocolate chip or like the the hot chocolate that I was talking about and let's say you know you cut into little pieces or like thin little pieces and you know you make [ __ ] chocolate out of it or something this literally tastes just like that it doesn't even like taste like its own chocolate it literally tastes like hot chocolate I'm not bad at it because I don't want to try this I like it would I buy it again probably not this exact one but maybe like try something else from the brand I don't know but I can't really say if I would buy it again until I know how the high is and how much how potent it is or whatnot I mean it says 100 milligram spot and you know why like after I'm done eating it I do feel like there's a little bit of like I can taste a little bit of wheat because I'm so familiar with weed because I usually smoke almost every other day you know I just know if it has weed in it and smelling it it smells like chocolate I don't think you could really tell if you were to just give it to somebody I don't think they would know mmm so I'm loving it more and then any more of those I'm probably just gonna try to finish it I don't know or me just have half I don't know maybe I might just have half I don't know yet but I'm going to be back within an hour or two hours I know it takes like two hours for usually for edibles to kick in so I'll be back when that happens and I'm gonna tell you guys how high this got me because I want to know - just like you want to know so you know how you know that didn't even make sense that there are you guys okay you guys so I've had so far I have had I wanted to do a little update because I didn't want shot a thing that I didn't eat at all you know what I mean so I ate half of it right okay so that's 15 million absolutely it's gone she's gone so my thoughts as of right now as of just consuming 50 milligrams 50 now 60 70 um I think it's really easy to eat honestly I like it I did like let it chill in the fridge for a little bit and then take it out so it's like the perfect like chocolate consistency just because it was room time but you guys don't care about that but I don't know if it's me or if edibles hit me hard or fast or if I'm thinking they're hitting me because I'm eating this already but I already am starting to feel a little different I don't know why I mean no I don't feel like a full-on [ __ ] faded or I don't even feel high but I know I ate some edibles and they're gonna hit and I'm thinking they're already hitting but they haven't even hit yet like I haven't even been 30 minutes I gotta keep a track of time okay so I had this literally at like probably like 6:00 or 6:10 so I'm guessing by like 8:00 to 8:30 I should be feeling the effects of this so I'm just gonna finish the rest of this and then once you know I am at the peak of my fated Ness I will check in back with you guys and I will tell you my initial thoughts of is that worth it I spent around $20 on this edible you guys $20 and that's not that much you know I mean for an edible that's pretty the normal range but if I'm paying $20 and I could have gotten another edible that would have got me way more lit then I want to let you know you know but this is my first time ever trying this brand the love familiar it is a product of Los Angeles so you know I'm pretty sure it's gonna be good you know it's gonna be lit so I'm just gonna eat this up and I'll check in back with you guys as soon as I'm done with it well as soon as I feel it okay okay you guys so I'm back with another update as always I don't think you can see me all that great so I'm gonna go by my window because it's about to be getting dark so it's probably like so I finished eating my out of all it is completely gone when you show you the [ __ ] wrapper it's gone I knew it was a tough thing to do but we're [ __ ] done with her okay so now you guys can see it better this was the la familia hot chocolate product of Los Angeles cannabis infused chocolate 100 milligrams so I consumed this I think I probably did it within like 10 15 minutes I don't know not even thumbs deviants are like 10 minutes I just had to kind of eat it slow because it was a lot of sweetness going on you know and I'm not really like a sweet tooth person I mean I like sweets here and there but eating a whole chocolate bar is kind of a lot so but I did it I did it I wanted to get really lit for 420 so I'm going I basically have a timer already going for like an hour and a half so I keeps at the time and not get too high and forget about it so once I am you know one hour and thirty minutes into this then I will come back with you guys and I will let you know how my I get so you already know deal yo okay guys I wanted to do a [ __ ] update because it's like 8 o'clock like 8:30 and I definitely feel the edibles they hate hard I think next time I'll probably do like 50 because I took a couple of like puffs off of like plug and play and look how fried I am I mean I don't know if you can tell but I'm [ __ ] fried but yeah I mean I would rate that at", "C2ko0fFeXaY": "what is good y'all good morning it is zoody patoot you already know back for another cannabis review on the baked boys you already know what it is if you don't definitely look into these guys definitely look these up these are the best thing on the cannabis market right now for vapes carts whatever you're looking into just for portable dabs this is freaking it uh freaking rechargeable tastes amazing better than any cart that i've i've come across personally uh it's just like taking a dab it even you know tastes like freaking mango this is what the whole box looks like and then you pop them out of the box and then another another baked bar packaging just so if you guys are getting these make sure like they are double packed and if they're not they're probably not real but these are a brand new brand new uh company uh straight from cali and uh they are just getting started so if you want to go ahead and look them up on instagram they're on instagram i don't think they have built their website yet but you know i've been talking back and forth with uh the person on there so uh definitely a good brand definitely quality quality product right here and that's what people are looking for especially in the cart game right now some people are scared of additives being being put in there it already says right here you know max strength lab tested and solvent-free to stood so uh it's got all the little markings don't throw it away you know recycle it properly it's a disposable so you know don't don't just be tossing it in the wrong or california they got big recycling laws and all that stuff so that's up to your discretion um 21 and older what is this right here probably not for pregnant women i mean just just basic stuff that goes on on cannabis products out in california but uh just guys go try one go try one because these are probably my new favorite thing in the world right now like you know i love my dabs but just having a portable portable little it's just like a freaking it's about the same size of a jewel or a uh a puff bar you know it's the same thing as a puff bar but it's just it's distillate so and they hit so freaking hard like you're just sitting here pulling it and then like when you exhale you don't even realize like you're blowing out a cloud because you barely feel it inhaling and to me that's that's how i tell if it's good distillate or not you uh it's not rough on the inhale but it's rough on the exhale and that's just a rule of thumb for all carts if you're experimenting with carts right now but you know thanks for watching y'all go get you one the baked bars bake the bar official on instagram go get into the hype you already know zooteep appreciate", "cCzulqCnNtY": "[Music] we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are reviewing probably for the last time because they've disappointed me so many times nother bar this time they're salted all chocolate as you can see here it cost me 12 bucks at my dispensary although I believe I got a discount for 10 is it 200 milligram edible and if it really were as potent as advertised or merely cody has advertised it would be a good deal I reviewed two nutbars in the past on the boat pretty disappointing to be honest so I don't have a lot of expectations for this one I reviewed a 100 and a 200 milligram in the past and found them both to be lacking in the potency department but but pretty good in the flavor so let's go ahead and note but be salted almond one chocolate here and give it a taste I believe I picked this up at cool calm collective and Huntington Beach Orange County so here we go we've got our packaging here this fancy gold foil we've got a little bit melted somewhere along the way but you can see what it looks like they're little nutbar symbols get a bite you can see the salted almonds on the back it's okay mmm very sweet chocolate very sweet did you like almonds you're gonna like it better than okay it's good chocolate take a second place we just did let you hmm not that low liking the chocolate yet again but how am I gonna like how it makes me feel for that guys you're gonna have to wait just a couple of seconds me however I'll come back to you guys in two hours let you know our feline thanks for watching weeks two hours later alright guys it's been two hours I've got to admit that this is the best of the nug bars that I've had so far I am definitely the most high from this one which is curious that I'm certainly more high from this one that I alright perceive myself as being more high from this one than the other two hundred milligram when I had not a whole lot more but but noticeably to me so there might just be some batch issues I'm not sure there but I would say the last time I was that maybe a you know three something like that and it's what I felt no rocking about a five so you know there's you know definitely something they're still not my go-to not gonna be my first thing I like the taste of it this actually grew on me quite a bit as I ate it I like the dark chocolate I have like all of theirs in terms of taste and this one ended up being a pleasant surprise in terms of I was expecting nothing from it and a nice little high so I got to give it to nug bar on this one they they they earned some kudos so as mild as praise is that that as I have given it I'm not sure if you can call that kudos or not but you know whatever thank you so much for watching wheats guys I appreciate you watching as always and we will check you out on the next review peace", "uY2eXh4gwoo": "what's up everybody Cubans here and today we're gonna do an edible mukbang I'm like over 2,000 milligrams of THC edibles that we're gonna try to eat there's a lot of stuff there so I don't know if I'm gonna be able to make you through all of it but we're gonna eat a bunch of [ __ ] and see if we can get super [ __ ] high let's see what we got alright let's take a look at everything we got here this is definitely one of my most expensive videos edibles just cost a lot I just I don't get them so we've been collecting them for a while but there's a lot of variety here we have candy bars and drinks and cookies and there's caramel waffles in there there's capsules is achieve the chew in there I got sweet tarts more gummies I got the flask which I did in the drinks video that we're gonna probably put in the drink here peanut butter lollipops just more in gummies there's a lot of stuff here I'm definitely not gonna be able to eat all this but I'm gonna add up the doses as I go like her piece I'll calculate them just so we get an idea exactly how many milligrams they eat but this is gonna be fun I definitely should have got more capsules because that's that's my favorite way to get the milligrams in yeah let's let's start eating I hope God it's so much sugar alright let's [ __ ] get started I have the pine mango Suns a sativa I'm gonna pour it in the cup and I'm gonna try to give an accurate representation of how many milligrams we're consuming but this bottle is about half a Stu hundred milligrams so we're gonna say it's 100 let's add this flask I think so this is gonna be 150 here it's definitely more than half okay all right 150 milligrams so when I finish this that'll be 150 but I'm gonna be drinking that small time oh it's not bad all right let's get started here I don't want to eat anything all at once because I want to try to eat as much of it as I can and honestly I'm like my stomach is already hurting thinking about consuming all of this but this bars a thousand milligrams I believe it has ten pieces hundred milligrams per piece I'll just and as we go 100 and 200 they have a lot of candy bars Oh to this size and 200 milligrams and it's 10 milligrams per piece up that trip gonna take a long time let's go for dose get another another 400 milligrams here excuse me another 200 x-ray undertow that's another 100 400 total [Music] [Music] mint chocolate is really good but alright let's just try some of these gummies so these ones 500 milligrams there's 10 pieces so it's 50 per piece just get one of these that's 50 over at 450 maybe I'll that a month I'm gonna add 150 from this these wanna gummies are 20 milligrams per piece [Music] [Music] it's about the same size gummy but 20 milligrams the other ones are 50 I love 24/7 be 2190 I mean just for the walls you have this to round us out of 500 where 500 now oh my god [Music] how much [ __ ] sugar [Music] i'ma going trick-or-treating as a kid and then just having a [ __ ] bag full of candy for days like day five you're just like I [ __ ] hate candy bro what did I do oh this feels like days hmm we're at 500 I think I'm just gonna take knees alright and there's four capsules in here for 350 oh 175 for two [Music] washing it down will we've rings anyway I had another one 75 this is another this will make 350 total from the capsules put us at 850 yeah I definitely should have got more of the capsules stupid alright so at 8:50 oh god I'm gonna get some of this this koala bar gone I think it has like ten hundred milligram pieces like the other one I'm just gonna have a couple here [Music] I'll hold this up it's a little weird but it's four pieces here it's like missing one a little bit on the corner here it's got things on the corner here these are 100 milligrams each this bar is just a little higher but this is a you don't think that's four please well there's another 400 milligrams Oh God I [Music] won't good and I'm trying to save some for my girlfriend she really likes it but he's sick and I don't think I'm going you know this is so much so much sugar [Music] we're at twelve fifty milligrams down mo and samosa I'm done in the video and the most I personally ever done that I can recall was like 1750 and the reason is I just I prefer Devon I get way more bang for my buck when I my Deb's and edibles like this is like hundreds of dollars of edibles and kidding I got discounts on on my bottom of coupons and stuff over time I didn't spend that much I got deals on most of this stuff but I went to go get this haul in one go to story look cost me a lot and I [ __ ] can't afford that [ __ ] [Music] just to get high I'd rather [ __ ] to drop a gram of diamonds on a nail for that price let's [ __ ] go drop a few grams I'd [ __ ] price goddamn I gotta mix it up I'm at 12:15 have these will sweet tarts little weed tarts I think they're only five milligrams each yeah there's a 100 pieces total five milligrams we're gonna see what we're gonna go I'm gonna eat them two at a time a good pen [Music] [Music] it's not sweet the eight [Music] mm face

they're meant for microdose I'm taking one other time they're good when you do that for like alright now we've got the Green Hornet here [Music] I know sometimes it focuses right away anyway it's one gummy for a hundred milligrams better than all bottle of gummy that goes [Music] [Music] it's very good and tastes like lifesavers and the consistency is close and the packaging Cana reminds me of looks like a straight-up lifesaver gummy [Music] pucker whatever you want that's another hundred you're not working 15 now have to go back in like double check when I'm editing or whatever but [Music] how else could the other chia-chu product this is America's favorite edevalla know whose this is Teva 100 milligram leave it you I like stuff like this worth 100 milligrams for a little thing I don't have to eat a whole bar or whole value then where I get it but we're tolerant see what the lower dose but I know like I've been eating for like 15 minutes here right house it takes to get touching my

piece is a hundred all right I suppose I said 2,000 without the milligrams Sam you're like I ain't that much but then at the same time okay I just ate 2000 milligrams of THC I ate a lot of different edibles candy bars that means lollipops I'm not high yet from the edibles so take a little while to kick in the drinks I might be feeling the drink a little bit they don't think I love you in my experience I might be feeling that but a little bit here I mean I don't know how high I'm gonna get from two thousand milligrams I took 1100 milligrams of capsules not too long ago I was pretty high I mean I wasn't like super [ __ ] blitz i streamed on Twitch the whole night after I just I think I did like a nice eight hour stream or something I can't remember but I have the video same down my

make sense of your dispensary life here behind us is the beautiful mountains in I believe Nevada I think we're now out of Oregon we're just leaving the Eclipse out on this wonderful road trip and we're taking a break here at this rest stop exit and we're gonna be reviewing a nutbar our second product from nug bar they're just boring milk chocolate 200 milligrams we reviewed their 100 milligram last time I actually found it to be not that good I didn't get that high from it unfortunately but I've got a lot of high hopes for the 200 milligrams I'm gonna hope it's just more potent in general least twice as potent as the hundred milligram it is a much better value it only cost me 12 bucks of my dispensary and I got it even for a discount at that I believe I got it for 10 bucks to 10 dollars for a 200 milligram chocolate bar if it is in fact potent as advertised is a very very good deal but it actually has to be as potent as advertised for it to be a good deal so guys without further ado I'm gonna go and open her up I take a bite out of it and then I will be back in just a few minutes for you guys two hours for me to let you know how I feel oh we got some melted going on here lot of melted gotta be careful oh shoot so it's a little melty guys gonna be careful with it good chocolate barely melted see you guys in two hours thanks for watching [Music] it's been two hours for me since I had the nut bar and milk the chocolate I think that's when it's called I left the package in the trunk I can say I'm really disappointed with nutbar they're not very good their products taste pretty good the two I've had I liked quite a bit but it seems like they taste pretty good because they might be masking the fact that they have less cannabis than advertised which is a shame because they say that they are rated by a laboratory I don't know anything really about CW analytical which i think is who claimed to be their sort of laboratory we're doing buddy but I definitely don't feel like I hated 200 milligram edible even after having my mind [ __ ] blown by this Eclipse and I know I've been talking about this eclipse a lot but if you saw it you kind of understand why so that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys and that's going to do it for the road trip series on meats as well I appreciate you guys watching as always and we will see you on the next review peace", "vu1RKWQtN-M": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today I have a very exciting video that's been highly requested and I'm sorry it was taking so long I'm going to be showing you guys how I make my extra strong green dragon picture this photo has one cup of liquid and 10 grams of wheat and then I reduced it to 1/3 of a cup meaning that now there is 5 tablespoons in 1/3 of a cup so every tablespoon is 2 grams of wheat you're gonna need the carbs wheat for this recipe and I'll post a link of how to do that below here's what you're gonna need alcohol that is 95% alcohol or higher some coffee filters or cheesecloth a funnel some mason jars and 10 grams of the carb to read the first step is to freeze your Dakkar bleed for at least 24 hours I have already done that and now that it's been over 24 hours I'm going to pour in 2/3 of a cup of vodka that has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours the instructions for this can still be followed even if you're not using the same amount of wheat that I am which is 10 grams all you have to do is pour enough vodka to fill just to the top of the weed now you're going to shake it aggressively for 5 minutes then you'll put it in the freezer for at least 2 hours I ended up leaving mine in the freezer for about 20 hours there's no need to leave it for long within 2 hours I did that simply because I ran at a time now I'm placing a funnel into my mason jar and I'm going to poke some holes into my coffee filter so that it flows through a little bit quicker if you don't have any coffee filters you can also use cheesecloth then place that into the funnel now you can take your weed and vodka mixture out of the freezer and shake it aggressively for another 5 minutes pour your mixture into the filter and try to avoid spilling it over the edge like I do here then wait for it to filter through this can take a while sometimes even up to a half an hour you can see how slowly it comes out of the bottom and then once almost all of the liquid has gone through I'll move the weed around to try and facilitate more of the liquid to be filtered through I put some gloves on because if your fingers are touching the weed and vodka it can absorb some of the THC and we obviously don't want that because that would be a waste now that all the vodka has gone through the filter I'm going to scoop back the weed into the jar you can see how much weed is left in the funnel because I spilled it when I poured it in so again try to avoid doing that if you can [Music] now I'm going to pour in 1/3 of a cup of vodka that again has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours and then I'm going to pour it into my jar weed that I had already filtered once now again if you're using different proportions just use enough to just cover the weed you can just pour it straight into the jar I'm just using the funnel so I can try and get some of that weed that's stuck to it the first time now once again I'm going to shake that jar aggressively for five minutes now using that same jar and same filter that I'd use the first time I am going to pour in the mixture that we had just shaken into the jar that we first used [Music] now this step is optional but I'm going to pour in a little bit of that very cold flash-frozen vodka to get the remnants out of my jar again you don't have to do this but I don't want to waste anything so every little scrap I can get I'm gonna take now once again we're going to let that filter through and it is going to take a long time just like the first round did [Music] once that's all dripped through we're going to place a clean funnel into a clean measuring cup or mason jar as well as a new clean coffee filter and we are not going to poke any holes now we're going to pour it in and we're going to wait for this to drip through this step is not necessary but I like mine very clear so I like to filter out any imperfections if you like you can do this step twice but it does take a long time so I only do it once and I find that the one time is sufficient to get it very pure and clean I'm also going to take the filter with the weed that has been filtered already and press it out as much as I can of course make sure you're wearing a rubber glove so that your skin is not absorbing at all yeah and just try and squish oh as much as you can and then that little bit of leftover that is on the parchment paper there I mean if you're just using this for yourself you could just lick it up I don't know if you don't want to waste it anything works yeah so just squeeze out as much as you possibly can it's been about a half an hour and almost everything has filtered through and we have a total of about a little bit under a cup of liquid because some of that vodka is lost in the extraction process [Music] now we need to reduce our tincture to a smaller amount and we're going to use that by using a double boiler thing which I don't have so I'm making my own version and I'm just using my instant pot so that I can do it in the living room where I have better lighting so I am wrapping some tinfoil around it so I can contain the heat as much as possible and I'm just going to put my measuring cup on to the side of it and then wrap the tinfoil kind of around it that way not too much water and heat is evaporating all you want to make sure is that your bottom of your mason jar or your measuring cup like I'm using is not touching the water so same concept as a double boiler so I both to put it in there but I just have to show off how beautiful it looks it's so clear so golden absolutely beautiful I hope you guys appreciate how wonderful it looks because a lot of my friends and family don't really feel the same way as I do so I just love being able to share this stuff with you guys online please make sure you do this any well-ventilated area so I have all windows and doors in my house opened as well as if your dreams on the stove have your hood fan on there is no smell at all so unfortunately my instant pot broke part way through I don't know what happened so I moved it to the kitchen and I made this sort of contraption thing because I could not put the measuring cup on the edge of the pot because I don't have anything deep enough where the bottom of the measuring cup wouldn't touch the water so I just put a metal strainer on top and then created some insulation with the tin foil kind of like how I did it the instant pot so while you're watching it when it's bubbling a lot like this that's a little bit too much so turn your heat down a little bit you do want a little bit of movement but not that aggressively now I reduced it down to one third of a cup and that took me about an hour and a half I believe you can reduce it more or reduce it less it just depends on how strong you want it to be now it's ready to pour into a jar to save you can use this with a dropper or you can put into your gummies or into your drinks there's so many different ways to use it hopefully you guys will check out some of my gummy videos and try it out in one of those recipes and here's the finished product which is absolutely beautiful thank you so much for watching with the measuring cup I didn't want to waste any possible tincture so I heard some iced coffee into there and now I'm drinking that so that's a good way to make sure you're not wasting anything if you guys enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe and please let me know if there's any videos you would like to see me record because I would be happy to do that thank you guys so much for watching have a great day [Music]", "YBfiRD2pDkY": "today I'm going to be attempting to turn myself into the Grinch but first we're gonna eat a special treat my

chocolate and I loved it it knocked me off my feet knocked me flat what a wonderful product so I am super super super excited for the second delta-9 review for their salted caramel I don't know if I mentioned this on the back last time so this is rated by SC labs so you know it's actually got the 240 milligrams of THC they promise and they also say that a portion of the proceeds from the sale of this product will go to cancer research so how cool is that so you can eat a little less guilt free knowing that some of your least money there is gonna go to cancer research so it comes in this triangle-shaped packaging here kind of weird kind of odd shape but that's okay it tasted pretty good last time and it got me really [ __ ] up so that's the most important part but this is the first time you ever tuned into a wheats review before the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat this bad boy in front of you here maybe not the whole thing just don't want to bore you today and then I'll come back to you guys in well a little bit longer than two hours is about to walk into a movie to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of the every review finally got it

to it's a shitty [ __ ] Monday and we're gonna start things off right it's about 950 in the morning and I got one of these to get me through the day this is a medicated nerds rope seriously strawberry 400 milligrams of THC this is going to be wild yo it says I like I don't show you guys the whole thing just like sharing hair I get from Cali it says da right there I'm in Maine so other side of the country I shoulda thought about the fact I have braces it doesn't feel like I should be eating it and like 10:00 in the morning but you get strong but no this is obviously gonna take a while so I'm just gonna eat this real quick for you guys and check back in later at some point I'm dropping little nerd [ __ ] everywhere [ __ ] sweet I like don't eat candy but actually not enjoying this I really don't like this it's like the Nerds of the sour pirate but I don't even think that that has any THC in it it's probably all on the gummy so [ __ ] not pleasant to eat I'm sorry [ __ ] it's so [ __ ] sugary like halfway there it's all in my teeth gonna be tasting this [ __ ] for like an hour bought some blackberry Kush mostly endicott [ __ ] within because if you guys ever wondering if I have like a strain preference I mean I guess it's based on whatever I want to do like if I had like a whole day planned out where I wanted to get stoned but I had to go do things I'd pick a sativa but what the [ __ ] but most of the time I smoked to relax so I do enjoy like in the car better more often doesn't taste like weed at all that's not what I mean when I say it tastes bad it's just so [ __ ] sweet it's like early [ __ ] I took a shot of whiskey like it was like a little bit of whiskey and like a glass of my my throat's been like getting sore if you ever like feel like your throats getting sore and you take like a shot of alcohol or something for like an hour I'll just start to feel better but so I have that like sitting in my stomach a little bit and it's [ __ ] tangent well I'm sorry I from choosing if I'm chewing my mouth or talking on my mouth shooting with my mouth open I might already be stoned I don't even know fully last little bite here the video and see how this 400 milligram edible hits me etc ear actually I miss that but I guess it's supposed to work in 60 minutes I don't think that's a hundred percent if that's not represent accurate everybody obviously everyone's metabolism is [ __ ] different through it you'll make it hopefully I'm making it I'll check that few guys in a little bit all right so checking back in with y'all it's about two hours later I'm pretty stoned but like I don't know definitely not a stone as I like thought it would be so I'm just smoking now but I don't know I'm just I'm definitely kind of time just like feeling a little more tired but it's nothing like it's nothing like too crazy rolled up a little Jay got the absinthe flavored papers but he'll be here left this the main live cards as I've showed this pen yet but it's got like a little different voltage options of warm that up this cart is some blackberry Kush hybrid mostly indica so yeah I think I told you guys fun at the end of coz oh yeah let's give it a rip should I turn it down a little bit right there to about like 2.75 and then we'll take a blinker and hey I hate it like it's so awkward because like the cart [ __ ] never like screws on to like match up with the button so like five buttons right in front the [ __ ] mouthpiece is like awkward Cheers now I'm pretty big but I want to try some [ __ ] like I want to have either like a few 500 milligram edible doses all at once I'm just see what that's like because I really want to see if y'all got if you all remember my own the first time I ever took edibles story - it was crazy we don't really know what the dosing was but there's a slight chance there might have also been acid in it which if you eat that with edibles just makes it like way more I'm trying to think of the word like it just enhances the effects of like both highs I think and but yeah I know I want to see if that was like if that was the case or if that feeling is like 1500 milligrams worth of edibles because if it is I'm trying to [ __ ] get there - yeah that was such it was a good day but it was like a terrible day at the same time cuz like I wasn't expecting it is there I don't know there were times I was like worried there's a long [ __ ] story you guys should go back and watch that video if you haven't thought was a [ __ ] it was a banger oh [ __ ] well battery's just about dead anyways plug this [ __ ] and I know I think you know this this is like a pretty decent edible for me I just I need to take more but now mm-hmm I hope you guys enjoy the video I'm definitely gonna be takin I'll do a video of me taking a shitload more edibles um have like a big-ass me I'll have like a bunch of different [ __ ] to eat drinks it's actually a dope idea anything but no drop a like if you guys enjoyed the video comment and favorite way to smoke away smoking from state country whatever but yeah stay lifted everybody have a good a stay in peace y'all", "db3sIVwDbUM": "- I feel like CBD is for people who do not have a weed plug, and can't afford a psychiatrist. (upbeat music) - I want to try CBD because a health food store near my apartment sells it for so much money, and I don't want to buy it. So I pitched a story on trying it for Jezebel. (laughing) - Cool. - I'm generally very angry, and filled with hate. And, I also like to get wavy, and weed makes me paranoid. So hopefully this will be a good remedy for all of those things. (laughs) - I was picturing like a Monopoly piece size. - The thimble, yeah! - Yeah like the thimble. - These are like, I don't know, the size of like, a large thumb, like the tip of a large thumb. - I really thought of CBD gummies as something that rich people who love Goop and The Wing are into, however, it comes in this sort of fancy cigar box, which makes me think that they're french. (chill beat) - It's like slime, kind of. (techno beat) - You get that sort of undertaste of weed, like when you eat a regular edible marijuana. - It's more flavorful than my antidepressant. - Okay - Which I don't chew. (all laughing) - I feel pretty much the same as I did before eating the gummy, but I also just ate a lot grits and pork, I think, so I feel a little tired from that. - I feel like my normal self. My normal self I think is like, everything is fine because it has to be. - I also can't tell if it's like, oh am I just feeling the effects of something, and feel more relaxed and having a good time, or like, maybe I'm just having a good time being around all of you. - [In Unison] Aww, yeah. - But it could just be like the gummy I ate, yeah. - Oh, interesting. Cool. - I kind of felt a little light outside the studio, I had a bagel before this, so, the results might be skewed, I don't know. My results might be different, 'cuz I didn't eat it on an empty stomach. I wonder if that's better or worse? - I think that this is gonna be a video that's partially about Jezebel understanding how we react to food, because I think that some of it coincided with the lunch that we just ate. - On a daily basis, I usually feel very anxious. Constant anxiety every second of the day. I'm not feeling anything right now. - I do feel something that sounds like descriptions of people, almost when you're like, coming up or something. Almost like something's mounting, just like, very subtly or something, there's like a slight tingliness in my feet. - Sometimes with edibles, I can't really tell if I'm high, either, but then some of them I feel it like, 10 minutes after, and I can like really tell. This is more like, I can't really tell. - It's subtle. I mean I feel like, slightly different maybe, but I can't tell if that's just because I want this thing to work. - It doesn't compare to most of the other drugs that I've done, in any way shape or form. However I would actually, like, I do feel very relaxed, and I would say that it is akin to my SSRI. I did feel like actually pretty tightly wound, and quite angry, I do not feel that way anymore. So maybe it is working. My arms feel slightly weird. They kind of feel like... - Like jigglish, like kind of loose? - Kind of just loose, yeah, and it's not like when, don't do this at home, kids, it's not like when you take like MDMA or whatever, and you're like, \"Ah, I have to put my arms over my head!\" - This works more than I thought it would. I think. For sure. - Yeah. Yeah, like I wanna take the leftover box. - Yeah yeah, like, we would split the, yeah sure. - Yeah I'm not sure yet, I might just like, stick to my SSRI, but I mean, again, obviously I took my SSRI this morning and felt rage, and now I don't, so maybe I should. - Maybe you could supplement your SSRI with this. - With CBD, yeah. It just seems like, a little bit, like it's more expensive than my SSRI. It seems like a little pricey, and so perhaps the CBD industry should think about making it where it's more egalitarian, so that more people can use them. - I think these gummies might be good for people who don't want to go full-on into weed, or they maybe don't feel like vaping, or having an edible. And they just want to like, feel something nice, or calming. - I definitely think that it works, and I feel like whereas before I was very Daenerys Targaryen with my rage, now I feel more Cersei with it, where I'm very like, sort of removed from the rage, and then therefore I can use it more as a weapon, which is exciting to me. - I think it reduced my anxiety, in combination with lunch and friendship, and I think that the pain of being alive is a permanent condition. - I must agree with Katie, actually.

today's video I am going to be eating a hundred milligram edible for you guys I did get this on 4/20 and I am barely going to eat it with you guys just because I don't know it's been in the fridge it's been getting cold and I thought why not do it today today is my day off so your grocery and yeah so I'm gonna consume this a hundred milligram edible for you guys and see what it does to me I am a huge smoker so I don't know if it would hit me as much but honestly it probably will because edibles hit different than smoking like honestly honestly if you eat edibles they will hit like major but yeah so I'm gonna eat this for you guys hopefully I don't feel like I'm dying and then from there who knows this video will probably be a short vlog and yeah I'm just gonna go about my day on an edible and see the effects of what happens so let me set the camera for you guys and then open this oh so I am in my little sister's room I am at my mom's house and yeah there's nowhere else I'd rather take a hundred milligram edible than my mom's because if I freaked out which I probably won't but if I freaked out my sisters are here and my mom is here and everybody is here so if your girl feels like she's dying everybody is here hominy yeah yeah so let me set this camera up for you guys and then let's do it okay you guys I'm so mad at myself because I literally broke the freaking edible and I didn't want to do that I wanted to show you guys exactly what it looked like and your girl is just not paying attention if you guys have ever tried these let me know in the comments down below and what you guys thought about them so I've tried these before they were good and let's do this again so here we go I'm gonna break this seal for you guys know it's childproof it's childproof you guys it doesn't even have a little cut for you to follow do you have scissors money so you legit might need a knife or some scissors to open the packaging which is always good that's like an a-plus because if you have kids or you have little adults around you don't want them to easily access these things because yeah Oh Jax is sad he's crying outside right now but I don't want him inside because he's just gonna he's just gonna bark and do odd things possible but he's sad because jenna so just dipped or she went somewhere I'm not sure but okay so I went ahead and cut it open I'm sorry my nails are a little rough right now one is really bitten your girl has been super anxious and nervous and if you know me you just have a lot of anxiety sometimes and believe it or not I get and I get anxiety attacks and it's just a struggle you guys so if you guys know what they feel like or you guys are also going through the same thing I hope that you guys are doing everything possible to just stay calm and everything is gonna be fine you guys I always try to remind myself that but anyways it smells so good these are dark mint chocolate bars and they legit smell like dark mint chocolate they really do you guys let me push them it to the front they literally broke it in there I am so upset with myself but they still looks so good okay let's do it I'm gonna eat the whole bar you guys so let's do this they are look look at how they're packaging for their chocolate is like go ahead and hold that for you guys look at that it literally tells you the milligram of each little bar that is crazy I don't even remember eating the other one and I don't remember being this excited about having the milligrams on the bar I don't know I guess yes yes if you guys how do you say it um if you guys are dosing or how would you say I money you just oh yeah mone is smart she okay so if you are micro dosing and you are a big believer or a big person who does micro seeing these are exactly what you need but let's do this image it tastes like dark chocolate man mm sorry 20 milligrams yeah 820 milligrams right there let's go ahead and eat oh my god I'm such an idiot you guys and you guys are not telling me so apparently it doesn't give you the milligrams on here I just assumed that they did but no it doesn't it actually says THC on the bar d\u00f6 oh my god I'm either dumb or I'm blind you guys I'm so dumb but it does say THC on them on the packaging and lets you know that each bar is 10 milligrams so I just assumed that that's what it was on that's what was written on the bar but you know what it's still cool it still lets you know how many milligrams each little bar is and honestly dude the reason why I like these is because ok 30 more milligrams and then it's 50 milligrams total and you can't argue with that [Applause] and I got this one this one didn't break yeah so this one didn't break you guys and 15 milligrams for this little bit is yes yes I love edibles that are tiny but they pack so much like a little brownie that's 100 milligrams like thighs the best because you don't have to eat as much like it legit gets to the point it's not like you have to eat 50 cupcakes to get 100 milligrams like no I love that they high dose these things so that you can eat less of it but get more of a punch like those are my favorite edibles look 20 more milligrams what is that now 70 milligrams oh my god I'm freaking myself out honey you're gonna be here with me okay my sister said if I feel like I'm dying she's gonna be here with me you're gonna remind me that I'm not dying she was gonna remind me I'm not dying guys honestly I can always have I can always be having a bad day but once I get on camera for you guys and I talk to you guys I just make a difference I do feel better I do feel the best I could be sometimes but yeah like I really like being here with you guys you guys motivate me of course I do want to do big things when I'm older I hope you guys stay to see what the [ __ ] that J and J twins are gonna do in the future my sister has a boyfriend and they're hella cute you guys so shout out to all the couples out there especially my sister's relationship because he is so nice you guys like so next so nice oh hi there any more milligrams and that's gonna be a total of 100 milligrams you guys so recently hmm yeah I would buy these again mm-hmm yes mm-hmm so recently I took half a tab with Hubert he took the pool tab you guys I don't know I don't know people could do the most and still survive but me knowing I'm gonna take a full time I know that it's gonna be full-blown everything like everything I'm gonna see God I'm gonna see [ __ ] mythological things everything so I took half a tab right you guys I swear I couldn't stop laughing like I was trying I was trying so hard to keep it together because like I wouldn't look at Hubert and I was just like in my mind it was so funny like to even look at him was so funny like I didn't know I didn't know why looking at him was so funny and while I was doing that I was applying to new things so that I can get my life together and go find better things so I was on my laptop like the laptop looked cool whatever but then I started to realize oh my god oh my god it's hitting like my half tab is hitting and that's why I only take half a tab Jax our guard dog our long-haired dachshund or jealous long-haired dachshund even after the tab was over and we woke up the next morning I even asked him I was I asked him how his tab fell and if he felt it and he said smack - smack but yeah I am my my half tops max I didn't think it was going through because I've never had great oh my god looks so young with short hair so I never like I never really have good experiences with papertabs usually jalisa gets us gel tabs and those are the ones that really really like always boom like and these paper tabs one time we took them and they just it didn't work out so yeah lesson learned gels are my favorite my point is don't be afraid to microdose don't ever feel like you have to eat the whole edible or take the whole tab like no I even take quarter tabs and I feel good I feel like I could take a quarter tab and go throughout my day or take a quarter tab and drink and have a good time so everything is possible you guys don't hurt yourselves but I will come back check up with you guys and see when this hits so I'll make sure to time this for you guys let me check and you're gonna wash my hands because I do not want to lick my fingers so it is currently 138 I will come back whenever these shit's hit which will be in like 30 minutes hopefully or maybe an hour who knows no one ever knows um yeah and I'll check up with you guys and see you later my dude shoutout to jealous because she is hooking it up with some boiling crab but yes but yes okay so it's been like 45 minutes okay you guys so it's 229 now and oh my gosh that's so weird why is it doing that anyways so it's 2:30 you guys and I am pretty faded I don't know what that means that's so weird oh it's doing it's like something the camera can see but not us okay guys so the edibles definitely hit you guys I was watching a really good movie right now called private life it's called private life and I was crying you guys I can't stop oh my gosh this edible is definitely hitting I was watching this movie called private life and if you haven't watched it you guys need to watch this movie like the movie is so it's real and I like that so yeah the edibles this is like 45 minutes after or 15 minutes after so like about an hour it took me to really get the feeling like I am super faded right now you guys like I'm just like deeply in movies right now if you guys want something that's gonna hit you guys should definitely get some wounds and if you like the mint flavor with chocolate this is definitely that so yeah thanks for watching and I will see you guys in the next video", "whx9ytKios8": "oh hi i didn't see you there [Music] what is going on people my name is chillady back at you with another dope ass video and in today's video though it is nothing like what you thought it was going to be it's interesting it's new not really it's okay anyway today we're going to be talking about the hard truths and negative side effects of delta a yes that is right so as you guys know i have made two videos over delta eight i made an edible video which if you haven't seen go check it out it's awesome and then i made a video just talking about delta 8 the carts those are my two most popular now i don't want to be known as the delta 8 guy but i've tried to get that bag though there hasn't been a whole lot of research done on it and now i've done more research on it myself i've had time to you know use it whatever um and i want to talk about the hard truths now we're going to spark an actual joint of weed of marijuana so cheers boys so the first thing on my list delta a is similar to delta 9 which delta 9 is thc that we smoke the cannabis and the only dif real difference is that literally the chain effect of the cannabis or the chain number 9 or something like that t-god can pull it up delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has a lower psychotropic potency than its close cousin delta 9 thc it is known to connect to both our cb1 and cb2 receptors well so they're very similar delta 8 is being discovered as an alternative to 9 since it produces a less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable high when compared well in the aspects of healing and stuff like that but for delta eight even though you can federally buy it it doesn't get you as high as regular weed does you still fail a drug test so like that's pointless wouldn't you rather just smoke delta nine now i know for some people failing a drug test is a really big deal you know what i mean man i had to change my hair i was over here looking like a 13 year old emo kid you can't accept me at my worst you don't deserve me on my back you're still okay with failing a drug test but buying delta eight online why are you choosing that over delta nine you know i would much rather smoke regular weed than fail a drug test over that all right the second thing now if you watch my delta edible video you'll know that at the end of the video i was smoking a joint outside we're gonna i also did a 1500 milligram edible challenge delta 9 thc and i was not nearly as high as i was off of just 75 milligrams of delton delta 8. i mean i was uncomfortable i was tired i didn't want to do anything i got nothing done that day i just was like done i was like all i want to do is sit here and melt on the couch don't ever fit into the quote or the stereotype that you don't do anything but you need to do more when you're smoking that way people know first it was fine i was relaxed but then after like two hours i was like oh man i was like this is terrible all i want to do is like go to sleep i gave these edibles to a couple co-workers they all said that they were just like super relaxed off one but then i gave them two and they were like oh man it's too much my girlfriend could only one she ate one went to work and was like [ __ ] up she said it was terrible she would never do it again if you want to be lazy and like you want to do nothing all day and you just want to sleep uh i definitely recommend it it would be helpful if like at night on to the next one so the next one is the dab pins you can buy all this stuff online okay this is federally legal so just so you know like i'll put the link again in the description i wish they'd come and [ __ ] uh sponsor me man so i noticed though because i i had used two two dab cards i smoked two of them but first of all the price is ridiculous i mean it's like 35 40 and you gotta wait for it and that kind of sucks that [ __ ] was harsh look look look at me moss that [ __ ] was harsh okay like it really like i wouldn't even blow it out my nose and it would hurt my nose which is crazy and like it would make me always cough and it was like a anybody that i let hit it anybody anybody bro they would [ __ ] cough their ass off like people that smoke like what the [ __ ] it's like a really big rush of like this big body high like just right away and it was weird and then sometimes i wouldn't get high at all like one minute i'd be really high the next i wouldn't it's supposed to have really a non-psychoactive effect that's what makes it different from delta nine um i don't know i don't know if that's really true though to be real honestly that brings me on to the next thing is that it has a pretty bad stigma people for some reason thought think it's like that synthetic weed that spice that [ __ ] back when we were like young i can't believe anybody smoked that [ __ ] i did i will be honest i'll if you guys want to do a story time about that it is hemp it is from him it is hun no there's it is not that [ __ ] but it has a bad stigma i mean it's definitely not that spicy [ __ ] though for sure so that brings me to my last point okay so they're already trying to ban it like they're i don't know when they're voting i think they're voting in like november or december somebody told me in the comments it's like to me it's not you know to me it's not fake weed but i think it's still a little sketchy you know it still has a lot of positive benefits as well though and so i'm thinking if you had seven likes on this video if we get seven likes okay you guys have been [ __ ] killing it bro look look you guys been killing it all right i appreciate all y'all for real we're getting more subscribers i'm trying to hit 50 by let's see what is it september i'm trying to hit 50 at least by the end of october

know no dad smoked nothing just completely on the edible", "pUhJnKKQDTE": "as marijuana becomes legalized throughout North America [Many] are trying edibles for the first time as a healthier option but with Edible marijuana Providing such a different experience than smoking how does it work and is eating pot Actually better for you? When you heat cannabis you effectively change the chemical makeup of compounds within it called Cannabinoids Smoking heats it to around 800 degrees Celsius and converts thc a to Delta 9 thC which binds to receptors in your brain making them continually fire and causing your imagination, thoughts and perceptions to magnify this is why every thought can feel like a significant one and Because it travels straight from your lungs into the bloodstream and to your brain the drug works within minutes and lasts about two to [three] Hours, but when making edibles the weed is heated to around 150 degrees Celsius burning less of the actual plant and minimizing Carcinogens ThC is Lipophilic not water-soluble so the activated Thc must be dissolved into something fatty like oil or butter and once the substance is consumed the onset of the high is delayed as the drug is absorbed more slowly through your gut but this high typically lasts four to eight hours and most report feeling more high than Compared to smoking marijuana [this] is because when you eat edible weed the ThC is first metabolized by the liver before entering the bloodstream and here Delta 9 thC also becomes 11 o h thC which Passes the brain barrier more rapidly and is a more potent chemical so using the same amount of marijuana You actually get more high with Edibles because it ends up creating both Delta 9 ThC And 11-OH-THC which is a stronger compound and because there are more? psychotropic types of Cannabinoids acting on your neurons you'll be high for longer of course you also get to skip out on the toxic chemicals that smoking provides like Carbon monoxide Bronchial Irritants and tumor Initiators smoking anything means you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules so if you can get high without smoking it will be healthier for your lungs and body the downside it's much harder to control the High you'll get because it can take up to one to two hours to feel the full effects and the dosage can vary significantly modulating the effects or Titrating as it's called is much more difficult [and] as a result you can end up a lot higher than you intend - but unlike those who consume too much alcohol Opioids or other drugs you won't be suffering any serious long-term harm Toxicity [or] Lethal overdose if you do consume more than you intended [if] you've ever wondered why marijuana gives you the

everyone the marijuana reviews show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I get a lot of questions about people asking for tips for determining if an edible is potent as advertised so today guys I'm gonna share with you five common sense tips on how to avoid getting scammed when it comes to buying edibles getting scammed at the dispensary is pretty easy it's a nascent market with little to no regulations and zero accountability there's also lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of money to be made so lots of money and no accountability equals sleazy scores for scammers and fraudsters and it's bad enough when dispensaries and growers mislead their customers on what strain or how potent the flower they are buying is but at least the customers can see the product they can verify its weight they can smell it or whatever other rituals they have to test their weed sure they may not be getting the premium product that they are supposedly paying for but if they're buying an amount they will generally get that amount edibles however are much easier to scan customers with a customer can't verify that 200 milligrams or whatever listed on the package is really 200 milligrams they don't see the edibles getting made they can't see it being packaged if you want to buy a product you've got to take the company at its word that their product is potent is advertised store that your dispensary isn't gonna sell you a shitty product and good luck with that so I don't want to scare anyone away from edibles because they're [ __ ] awesome there are tons of great and reliable edible companies out there and more certain to come soon and experimenting and trying new products is half the fun but before you go and buy something expensive you've never seen before try utilizing these five tips to save yourself some money and some heartache so tip number one don't trust weed maps or your bud tender for their recommendation both these places especially weed maps is swamped with a bunch of bots and fake reviews that amp up a lot of really shady companies like lol edibles or infused creations all those have been pumped up by their respective companies and they mislead you and also speaking of people that mislead you your bud tender may very well mislead you they may have some kind of sales contract or sales target for some specific edible or they may have some kind of relationship with an edible manufacturer and they may be just be trying to sell you something that is not very good I've certainly seen it happen many times I've seen a lot of bud tenders Hocking lol edibles saying it's you know the second coming do not be fooled by them do your own research ahead of time don't trust weed Maps don't trust your bud tender know what you're looking for add of time so tip number two is in this case you want to judge a book by its cover or you want to stick to those reputable brands and what I mean by judge a book by its cover is looked at like the packaging is the packaging nice is the packaging fancy does it really show off the edible and all its glory I'm just talking about canna Co I'm talking about Korova here these guys have great packaging vibrant packaging that really shows off and sells their product and generally speaking the fancier the packaging the nice of the packaging the nicer the product maybe because they have the money already from being a bigger brand to invest in their packaging you know I'm sure it's the dog wagging some tail here a little bit as to what comes first but really take a look at the packaging do not buy anything that's just in like a plastic ziplock bag with a sticker over it it's usually going to be a bad product you want to take a look and make sure it has respectable packaging faziz that's usually a pretty good indicator that it's going to be a decent product so again judge a book by its cover and stick to those reputable brands stick to the big-name guys out there the big-name guys are big names for a reason again that's gonna be your Korova that's gonna be your Kiva that's gonna be your Kanaka that's gonna be your flourish the big guys are big again for a reason and they all have nice packaging so again look for the fancy packaging stay away from crappy packaging it's usually a pretty good indicator that what's inside is just as what's it's just as crappy as what's on the outside so tip number three is baked goods are good and chocolate is the best so I'm gonna go ahead and combine this with don't be a dummy stay away from gummies that is mostly true almost all gummies are bad with a few very notable exceptions like flourish do not get infused creations do not get at up here you're gonna see a ton of prepackaged edible or gummy edibles out there and they are almost always terrible with again a very few exceptions when it comes to gummies if you see flourish go and pick them up but outside of that stay away from the gummies there are usually a little bit cheaper than other things usually sometimes even substantially more so but that's for a reason because they are not as potent as advertised so stick away from the gummies State stay close to the baked goods your cookies and your brownies not even the Krispies like the rice krispies treats the fruity Krispies i'd stay away from those as well I don't find those to be as potent your brownies and your cookies are your best bets but for the absolute best bet go with the chocolate bars that is the best way I have found on all of my reviews for getting THC and the most potent gram for gram has always been chocolate bars kiva bang for twenty two phones say all those great ones there's so many out there and it's usually if you can find a chocolate bar it's gonna be a fun fun ride so again tip number three baked goods are good chocolate is the best stay away from gummies alright so that brings us to tip number four and that is to look for independent lab testing results this is a big one if you can find on you package or somewhere actual lab testing results that is he and don't just look for them to say lab tested look for the actual results you'll see tons of edibles out there lying about being lab tested and then this that and the other but if they don't have that actual result printed on the package it's no good plenty of people will lie about being lab tested or they'll get one product lab tested and say their entire line is lab tested if you don't see the actual results it's wasn't lab tested just go with that so look for that lab tested results look for independent verified results printed on the package or if not printed on the package printed it on a sheep close by something that will let you know that is as potent as advertised so again if you can find those lab tested results and it comes up as potent as advertised go and pick up that product it's gonna be good to go and then finally our fifth tip here is the most important one and the one that I cannot stress enough and that is you get what you pay for when it comes to edibles if there is a deal that seems too good to be true if you see a 500 milligram rice krispies treat for ten dollars don't go running for your wallet to pick it up and buy up the entire stock because they're lying to you it's not gonna be 500 milligrams it's probably not even gonna be twenty milligrams it's probably just gonna be an operation to fleece you out of your money if something seems very expensive there's usually a reason for that if it seems out of line it's probably because it is high quality stuff made with quality cannabis and quality ingredients and it's gonna stand apart the best edibles out there do cost a little bit more but they are absolutely worth it and almost invariably true if a product seems to be too good to be true in terms of price it absolutely will be so stay away from anything that seems to be too good to be true in terms of pricing and make sure that you know edibles are expensive guys so don't be surprised when you have to pay 22 bucks for a hundred and eighty milligram chocalate bar that's just gonna be the way it is out here but again you get what you pay for so if you pay that premium for that chocolate bar that fancier looking brand you're almost certainly going to be rewarded in terms of potency or taste or whatever the case may be so you absolutely get what you pay for and guys those are our five tips there just to run through them one more time don't trust weed maps or your bud tender for your recommendation do judge a book by its cover stick to those reputable brands number three baked goods are goods chocolate is the best stay away from gummies number four look for those independent lab testing results and then number five you get what you pay for when it comes to edibles what you pay for is what you get so if the deal seems too good to be true it very likely is and guys that's gonna do it just follow those five tips and you should be ready to enjoy some high-quality edibles and if you guys have any other tips or pointers that you want to share just leave a comment below and we'll be sure to include it maybe in a future video or pin it up there

definitely not on the moon certainly not on the moon and back it's not terrible I don't want to suggest it's terrible I'm at probably a for me maybe a 5 somewhere between a 4 and a 5 you know like that kind of level of high this was a $15.00 edible so you know you can't complain too much for that price that's a little worse than average but not substantially so I did like how it tasted tasted great there was just like cannabis taste but the rest of the chocolate was nice and smooth and creamy and had a great cappuccino flavor but I'm just not as high as I was hoping to be with the moon megadose chocolate bars here I was I was certainly hoping to be you know somewhere in outer space but yet I am still terrestrial what can you do alright guys thank you so much for watching wheats I

at work but [ __ ] it you do [ __ ] when you're dumb and young I mean I'm still dumb and young but I'm a little older but not much but that's the time I took edibles at work so hope you guys enjoyed

thanks for watching [Music]", "LbDVvYE64Bk": "[Music] glory be friends and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and look at this little puppy hook-shaped doohickey I've got here today Tara from Kiva Kiva guys we reviewed Kiva products before nothing quite like this we've only reviewed their chocolate bars which are among my favorite edibles if a little pricey they are delicious and today we are looking at their espresso beans coated in dark chocolate not only is this the first time I have had the tera kiba product this is the first time I've had chocolate-covered espresso beans so I'm excited on two fronts that's my dog Newton the back there everyone say hi so let's go ahead and open this up take ourselves bite and explain how wheats works so if you guys have never tuned in two weeks before the way our reviews work is I am going to take this edible eat some of it in front of you here not necessarily the whole thing because I don't want to bore you to death but I rest assured I will eat the next the whole thing over the next couple of minutes and I will come back to you in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review now we've got a sticker here that says hard to see with no background start with one bite that's the wait for at least two four hours for the full effects we're going to ignore that advice and go straight into the beans here we go whoo that tastes like dark chocolate covered coffee beans Wow that's not bad actually they're very bitter but no wheat taste so I see you I'm specific you're not also very caffeinated is that part of this I hope maybe a fun side effect so guys they're quite a few of them in here I'm gonna crunch and munch on them all and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how these guys are feeling I should come to you quite high and quite jittery from all the caffeine well who knows maybe unroasted espresso beans don't have caffeine I don't know who says who's to say we'll find out soon see in two hours feels like I'm caffeinated already see you then peace guys I am back it has been 2 hours thank you for sticking around and man I love this the Terra the Kiva excuse me the Kiva ter a hundred and twenty milligram espresso beans are great I mean I'm really high for 120 milligram Anibal they tasted great and I feel pretty energized like yeah you know like there's just probably quite a bit of caffeine in there maybe yeah this is this is a great great product another real win from Kiva I was I was optimistic about it but it was a little you know trepidatious and never had like the chocolate-covered espresso beans and was a little worried about how potent they might be and how they might taste and on both fronts I gotta say they exceeded expectations really happy with this one from Kiva and this is again the Kiva Tara espresso beans it cost me I believe 12 bucks at my dispensary worth every penny home run love it if you see it a dispensary grab it and that's gonna do it for this episode here on wheat skies I would throw this at the camera like I normally do but I'm afraid it would break it because I think this screen is made of glass yes I think it is okay all right well thank you so much for watching and we will see you on the next review peace No hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "UfXchhtG5NY": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary we help you decide what products are worth your hard-earned dollars at your dispensary and which ones are utter junk and today we are talking about one of my favorite companies when we haven't had a chance to review a product from in a while because they haven't had anything new coming out but now thanks to the new regulations here in California that make edibles be a hundred milligrams max and ten milligrams per serving Korova one of my all-time favorites has come out with a brand new line here they have the Korova Saturday morning mini cookies ten milligrams per cookie at it for a hundred milligrams total so ten cookies in here at ten milligrams each it's a huge package it's so much bigger than their normal packaging which is crazy its its massive and it was only ten bucks but then again that's a bit that's more expensive than their one hundred and fifty milligrams cookies that they used to have that were just single cookies but it's big packaging because it is holding ten little mini cookies in here I really like the packaging it's very handsome I really quite like it a lot it's got the new props on there keep refrigerated bla bla bla bla bla but shows you know it's compliant with them new regulations and then here on the back it's got it finally has nutrition information corroded before I don't believe actually had nutrition information on their packaging but they do now and it's got like the ingredients and all that fun stuff on there and now they have this child resistant packaging that is very tough to open because I've tried opening one of these before and they're quite difficult to open especially if you've not encountered it before I'm super excited to try these it actually I've been wanting to review them for a while they've taken me some time to find they're not in available and a lot of dispensaries yet which is odd because you know supposedly next month is when these regulations take effect although I believe you have until July to like get rid of your old stock of stuff but yeah I assume you'll start seeing these everywhere soon but I've been wanting to review these for some time because I assume they'll be as ubiquitous as kirova in no time so here's that obnoxious child-resistant packaging you have to place one thumb in the middle of the zipper and place one thumb into the back panel zipper and pull gently apart it's easier said than done you know what I'm just gonna cut into it because I hate it I hate the child-resistant label packaging I'm a child I'm too down for it dumb child here we go here are the mini cookies ooh they're handsome quite like them aesthetically they look a lot like the full-size versions don't have very much of a weeds odor chewy and kind of crunchy but good nice pretty good very little canvas ace if any at all I'd like it just as much maybe even a little bit more than their 150 milligrams Saturday morning cookie it's great it's got the rice krispies in there good cookie good cookie taste it's a little bit chewier and crunch here than I was expecting it to be but it's not bad it's not bad not a bad combination at all i I'm not dreading having to eat nine more of these so guys I'm going to finish the rest of this bag off I've got a lot more to get through and then I will be sure to let you know how I am feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review process I'm probably about two and a half three hours or something on my way to go see a movie and as soon as I get out of there I will let you know how I'm feeling thanks so much for watching wheats guys and I will see you in just a bit peace [Music] alright guys I am back it has been two hours since I had the kirova mini cookies medical cannabis Saturday morning cookies 100 milligrams THC 10 cookies and I am more than pleased to report that kauravas unrivaled potency is in still intact this is a strong hundred milligrams in these 10 cookies here in fact my only complaint about it is and it is a complaint well I guess my two complaints there the packaging sucks I don't like this child restraint and packaging because I'm I'm stupid I'll fully grot to that and you know I'm not I'm an intelligent person but it's annoying it's hard to open even trying to follow the directions it's not like the childproof pill bottles that are very easy to take off that's a minor complaint the big complaint is it's a lot to consume for one person I know these are designed for 10 servings and they really are because it's a lot to consume it's I mean you can see how big this packages and it's packed to the brim with those cookies it's for our calories of cookies which isn't a whole lot but at the same time ten of those little mini cookies it's not a insignificant amount it certainly feels like more than one of the normal size but still I'm gonna recommend it especially for this new wave of products that are coming in that are going to be these ten milligrams servings of ten servings each this is probably going to be really great III heartily recommend it if you cannot find if the any of the other Korova still lying around if your dispensary is only prop to 1/5 compliant grab these you'll be happy you did if not go ahead and stick with the original batch because that's gonna do you better but but these are a fine replacement it's not the end of the world for edibles but you know it's not it's not going to be the same same world we remember anyways guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching thank you so much and we will check you out on a later review peace that's okay", "VpMpblAm-Nc": "hey guys what is going on today we're taking a look at another edible this time the wonka gummies instead of the wonka uh chocolate bars we looked at not last week i think the week before um anyway lab tested i don't know about that lab tested for quality inconsistency confused with solvent free cannabis distillate [Music] so these are like a black market edible pretty much they have a bunch of different flavors i guess or types of gummies these are peach rings i think um there's some a nice nice government warning for you don't mind my dog complaining um but i like to like i didn't even notice this before but the rainbow finish on it i don't know what exactly that is but it looks fire 500 milligrams no children's california wow if we take a look on the back there's an actual nutrition fact section um no serving size or anything just really all that's in here it's just really just sugar and a tiny bit of saturated fat um not a significant source of vitamin d calcium iron or potassium i was not planning on it ingredients cannabis oil sugar glucose fructose syrup wheat flour malic acid dextrose palm oil citric acid artificial flavor antioxidants sorbic acid dufferin artificial colors um and usually these are um hopefully if you ever get these they will be sealed but even if they are sealed you can kind of tell they've been like tampered with like heat sealed you know what i mean so it's always a risk when you get something like this um it could be very very good but also uh could be very bunk but these ones i got pretty lucky because these ones are actually pretty gas for what they are i saved one of them so we can take a look at it let me take this bad boy out and there we are your basic candy ring and says these are infused but uh you can really really taste it on like the outside so i'm assuming these are sprayed and not infused but if you're looking for a really cheap edible that you're willing to take a chance on i i would recommend these uh it comes with a good amount of them and i i ate a few and i was feeling very nice so they do work depending where you get them but wonkagumi's uh a classic company made into something very frowned upon but oh well i hope you guys enjoyed the video i got a ton of videos like this on my channel if you want to check it out and uh yeah later", "J1OzJip0_Yo": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "BtQfL5wn6WU": "yo Kevin [ __ ] where is he coming yeah yo you in your room yo I've been here Mars what are you doing just taking a shower what no", "9JQPD7tPVxw": "what is up my fellow earthlings i am the duke of dabs here just bringing you to bring you some more canna content for the channel channels dedicated to medical patients and those 21 years as our aged smoke so let's get right down into brass tacks today it is tuesday once again sorry for the lack of Kanak content for the video i've just been kind of working a lot and well dealing with mental [ __ ] and I don't like to socialize when I'm dealing with mental [ __ ] but anyway long story short we got a review for us today it's gonna be the 4/20 bar brought to you by Sublime's distill it infusion process really good stuff it's 300 milligrams as so you can see here there is six total chunks of bar to it 50 milligrams a chunk I'm already eating a chunk earlier so I'm already kind of feeling the effects of 50 we'll just go ahead and this one like a crunch bar okay a little weedy not too bad some brands as I've shown you before some brands taste like a fresh 8th in your mouth this it's a little bit more low-key the chocolate does a good job of mashing that herbal taste yeah so this also contains omega 3 6 and 9 and getting some of your omegas here Omega 3 really good [ __ ] that's from fish oil and stuff I'm pretty sure but for anyone health-conscious out there this actually has a nutritional kind of fact brick chart to it they do utilize like I said distill it so it is going to be used it's not like you're using actual herbs to make this chocolate they're using the extractions so imagine like your shatters crumbles live resins you name anything that's broken down like that they're actually using distill it so that's actually a step further that's above live resin even so you know that's just cooking with gasoline they're big fan of edibles they got a different feel to them most of the time edibles always affect me within about an hour to an hour and a half of so chocolates are a little different since they melt down quicker I'd say probably about 45 minutes to an hour about at most for chocolates but yeah chocolates are probably one of my more preferred methods diet like I said digests real easy I've heard many good things from all different types of patients the females really like chocolate especially during the menstruation cycles don't ask me I don't know why but I guess chocolate is one of those things so it's just everyone boils down to their preference you know Cheers got the piece ruler going on right now it is a beautiful day at Arizona that snow we had come through is pretty wild huh but yeah so once again this is the 4/20 bar it's a I believe the actual company that makes it is under sublime they use it says here used with sublime distill it's which is that guy right there once again these are arizona reviews so I mean needless to say I mean I'm not gonna say that you can't find these brands outside of Arizona but it's gonna be harder to find brands like this outside of Arizona unless they have full-on made businesses for themselves in like California Oregon in Washington when I was out in Washington for Hempfest I saw the clear brand vaporizer company same same you know promoter guy same dude and everything that I saw here in Arizona but I was a thousand miles away like more than a thousand miles away up in Washington so it all really just depends on your marketing how much capital you know you're working with you know so so some people really do get around I would definitely recommend if you are a part of the industry stay away from med men med men are basically going to be the Walmart of marijuana they're trying to make a lot of lower businesses and local business style people go under so that they can mass-produce their quantity and whatnot that's not what this is about if you're one to do recreational that is a okay but if you're going into a medical community and you're trying to silence other Medical dispensaries shame on you that is not okay going into a dispensary state in trying to buy out all of these little dispensaries the ones that actually take time to you know talk to the patients and stuff just so they can buy them out fire everyone go all right guys let's get our stuff let's get these people in and out let's not even answer questions let's just get them in and out that's the recreational mindset and there's nothing wrong with recreation don't [ __ ] put it on medical patients you dickwads anyway that's just the last bit of my my little rant here sorry about that it really kind of ruffles my feathers when I hear people go oh so Mad Men this Mad Men that [ __ ] you Mad Men anyway Cheers yeah so this nice little video review here moving back to the chocolate sorry I kind of went off topic there and a little tangent kind of feeling pretty good from the chocolates there are six chocolates total in here in the entire bar there is gonna be its perforated into six sections so if your average dose is not going to be 50 milligrams then you can obviously cut that in half so it's like there's technically 12 small doses in there and by small I mean 25 milligrams some of the little older ladies are gonna be like 25 milligrams you [ __ ] insane no anyway it's just this was only 29 bucks this was only 29 bucks and 300 milligrams for 29 bucks that is a steal I know some companies that still sell 100 milligrams for like 18 bucks it's like 18 bucks for 100 milligrams versus 29 bucks for 300 it's like you do the math get out ways it you know it's just supply and demand some companies are able to actually front the product and they have just mass amounts of grow they can accommodate for that kind of thing some companies can't if you're newer into the startup it's gonna be probably a little bit pricier to get your product out on the shelves versus a company that has mass grow space if you have mass grow space that's more space for you to be able to grow the products used in to making the edibles versus only having a select amount so if you're looking into arizona as a potential area to move and invest money into if you're a medical investor be sure to think about that be sure to think about your own grow if you are able to get your own grow it cuts out the middleman and then in the long run you don't have to buy pounds for like twenty two hundred or anything like that or any crap like that you know you grow your own pounds at that point so if you're looking into investing medically in Arizona bring your big bags with you and then get your own grow facility that'll help majorly other great products from sublime also include they have the caramel chews they're gonna be fifty milligrams per chew there's five choose in the bag so essentially you get two hundred and fifty milligrams the caramels are no joke they if you dose them appropriately they will definitely do what you're looking to do great thing about Sublime's like I've already said they use the distill it's in their process so it's an even more refined advanced version of the cannabis extract so you're getting more potency to it for less price definitely check out some sublime products I particularly like the lemon tea cakes those guys are only 50 milligrams I mean a nice little shooter cake if you want to do 25 milligrams to cut a half a bit further half later they also or they also offer like the oreo brownies 75 milligrams PP cup brownie 75 milligrams those guys are pretty solid too I would say all in all I don't really have any qualms with sublime their product is pretty good it tastes good it effects pretty generally nicely I have a rule of thumb with edibles if you can't taste the actual herb it makes me skeptics me skeptical it's like the idea is that you want to mask the flavor as much as you can but even with all of those masks maskings you know if you can't taste the herb what makes you think that it's there you know so that's the only downside with edibles if you want a good strong edible it's probably going to taste like a fresh eighth in your mouth but hey at least you know that that's there you can probably you know gripe about the taste for 10 10 minutes drink some water or some and then go about your life you don't have to sit there at gripe about the taste oh well I can't get this herb I know I could edible down it tasted like to Irby for me I can't get the taste down well who cares you know suck it up Sally get the get the edible down and you'll get the effects well well worth what you're looking for so that's the only downside with edible you can't be a weenie some edibles do have a really low-key taste to them with you know like very minimal herb taste but in the long run go for something that has that herb taste you know what you're getting then you you at least know that there's going to be some actual urban that you know edible and then that saves you the long run you know then you don't have to go into your local dispensary and gripe to your local patient service provider oh well this edible tasted like [ __ ] I couldn't get it down I want my money back yada yada it's not how that works nice try Martha but you know that's not how this works you just have to you just have to soldier through it there's people that have eaten way worse tasting things and I can tell you what I prefer the taste of herbs than Reno robitussin so it's just kind of a tout ways but hey anyway listen I've been the duke of dabs here with just another little review video in regards to my channel if you're new here please mash that subscribe button be a fellow earthling not a peasant to poop soup we just want to be a nice little like-minded cannabis community we value the idea of you know medical smoking yes for medical reasons but we also embody the idea that there is a recreational side to it just don't be an ass and flaunt it you know it's like it just takes one bad apple to ruin the basket right so takes one sick fish to give everyone [ __ ] you know salmonella so alright duke of dabs out i'll catch you guys again here before too long i'll be making some smoke sesh videos let me know what you guys think if you guys have any edible brands that you might want me to look at or test myself please let me know and yeah i'll get around to it until next time i'll catch you guys later duke of dabs out", "GaXu1_tgNng": "\u266a\u266a Yo, yo, yo, what up?

I think we should start\nwith the NBX King Louis, we've been waiting\nfor that. Now, what John is doing\nis he's actually mixing the King Louis\nconcentrate, it's sauce. All right, we're going to wait\nuntil that heats up and then you're going to hit\nthat nozzle. So what do I smoke,\nthe end right here? Yes, sir. As soon as\nI start touching, you're going to\nbreathe in, okay? There you go. \u266a\u266a [ Coughs lightly ] [ Coughing ] Pretty good,\nright there. \u266a\u266a Beautiful flavor profile. Nice and tasty. I'm gonna hit --\nI'm gonna hit it -- I'm --\nI'm gonna hit it -- Yeah. one more time. \u266a\u266a We've got to get it now,\nI like this. Welcome to the club,\nmate. All right. For real, how much\ndoes this stuff cost, man? So the honey badger itself\nis about $250 retail. The sauce itself roughly\nbetween $50 to $60. What makes it special\nis the high terpenes. They've probably got four\nor five different terpenes, like limonene,\nbeta-caryophyllene, myrcene. They're testing around\n13-15 milligrams per, as well as\nyour cannabinoids, so the cannabinoids,\nthe THC is testing probably around\nbetween 75-85%, so you're getting some really\namazing pure stuff there. Cool, so how much does\nsomething like this cost? [ Record scratches ] It's $250 retail. Should we try the buggy? This device here\nis our showpiece, though. Our friends over at Ziggy\nhave been kind enough to provide us this rig\nto be able to play with. Took 14 glassblowers\nseveral hundred hours of work. It's a $150,000 piece. They want\n$150,000 for that? -Yeah. -That's right. You think they would buy it\nand use it or just buy it and keep it\nas an art piece? Typically we wouldn't allow\nsomebody to smoke from this, but, obviously,\nthis is a special occasion. Let's load that up\nwith the King Louis and let's give him\nwhat he wants. Yes, sir. You're going to have to\nput something on that, man, you're going to have\nto put a real boog on that mother fucker\nfor me. -Yeah, I got you. -I've been smoking a long time. All right,\nlet me try this shit. Come on. \u266a\u266a Mm-hmm. \u266a\u266a [ Coughs ] What do you think of\nthe taste and flavorings? [ Smacking lips ] [ Coughs ]\nI like it. Excellent. That's what kind of\nmake this sauce so special. I think\nwe should also try, which one\ndo you want to try, Adam? [ Coughs ]\nOoh. [ Laughs ] -The Alien Bubba. -The Alien Bubba? All right,\nlet's do that one. [ Laughing ] [ Mumbles ]\nI like that flower. You like the flower? Yeah, all this shit\ngets you too geeked. He's too geek --\nIt's too geek -- It's \"2 geeked, 2 fast.\" We've got here a cannagar\nour friends provided for us. This thing's worth, roughly,\nretail side, $500-$600. It's 1,000 milligrams-plus. They're amazing. They made it especially\nfor you, my friend. What they've done is\nthey've ground up the flower, wrapped it\nin palm leaves, and then they dipped it in oil,\nthey've got kief in it. It's a super joint\nis what it is. Do you want to\nlight it up? Sure do. That was\ncustom made for you. It's not a for-sale product\nhere in this market yet. Mmm. So, it's, uh... So you're one of the first\nto have it. You could\nblow it out and... I know. It looks cool for TV. $500, man. This shit. \u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a I tell you what. To be able to experience this\nand get paid for it, I can't even lie this is\nlike what dreams are made of. Man, I'm going to be rapping\nlike a mother fucker tonight in the studio. Man, that's the vibe\nI was looking for. Know what I'm saying? It's that real vibe\nI was looking for. -Hey, 2 Chainz. -What up, man. How you doing? What's your name? -Good to meet you. Chris. I'm with Club M. \u266a\u266a I hear you've got a delivery\nservice or something like that. Yeah, we do\na monthly delivery service for a cannabis\nsubscription box. Marijuana, munchies, music,\nand merchandise. $200 worth of it\nevery month for 97 bucks anywhere in California\nand soon in Las Vegas. -How much marijuana? -A lot of marijuana. -Is it good marijuana? -Really good. -That's cool, man. -Thanks. So what made you come up\nwith that type of idea? I really, as a kid, loved to get the encyclopedia\ndelivered to my house, so I designed my box\nto kind of look like one. -That's some geek shit. -It is super geek. So, tell me more about\nthe box and everything. -This is a monthly box. -Are these pre-rolled? -These are all pre-rolls. -Let me try this out. This is all different\nkinds of flowers. Man. Topicals, vapes,\nconcentrates, waxes. I love the presentation and it don't look\nall hot in the mail and shit when it comes. It looks like\nsome encyclopedias. Oh that's where you get\nthe idea from you was\nencyclopedia boy. So what I displayed here\nis something special nobody's seen\nbut you yet. Okay. -This is our $24,000 box. -Why would it be $24,000? First, we've got\n24 1/8th worth of flower that are delivered\nwith it. -So three zips a month. -Then cannabis cigar set. Got cannabis leaf, I've got\ntobacco, and I've got gold leaf. Three months aged,\npressed, and with rosin and sap\nin it, as well. Then we've got 24 vape pens,\n24 edibles, 24 topicals\nand tinctures and then each one will\ncome with a custom... -Gold tip. -24-karat gold. 240 diamonds in it. You got to let me\nkeep this, man. This right here is\nsomething special, man. The other product that's part\nof the $24,000 box is this. It's our vape exhale. That's a $3,000 easy bake oven\nand a bubbler all put together. That looks too expensive. I don't want to be\nresponsible for that. On the plane\nthey might mess with it. We've got this vape pen\nwith the gold. This is nice. How do you use this? So this one will do\nvape oil or the flower. -Really? -Yeah. So we just open this one up\nand you grind the flower. I love this. I want you to see one\nmore thing before we go, here. This is my custom box that would\ncome with the $24,000 box. What kind of wood\nis that? So this is\na reclaimed wine barrel. That's dope. That's how I need to get one\nof my floors done, wine barrel. -Somebody locked it on me. -Did you lock it on me already? There it goes. So you open it up... -It's nice, bro.\n-...it's all gold inside. Got your flower all ready,\nloaded up. This stuff\nit'll keep you fresh. It's my box? Is this for me? -That's yours. You got a key\nand I keep it -- [Mumbles] Oh, man. -Look at this, though. This is everything. I appreciate you all man. You'll be able to roll\nyour own joints right here. Oh, a rolling tray man. Look. [ Angelic singing, stops ] [ Singing resumes, stops ]\nOkay. Now it's locked. Boom. -Boom. Boom. Okay. Boom. [ Singing resumes, stops ] You got it figured out? Oh, man,\nI love this, man. Thank you so much, man. [ Smooth jazz plays ] \u266a\u266a This is nice man. We're here with\nan innovator himself. This is next level\nin the cannabis industry. I'm happy\nto be a part of it. I'm happy to be\nreporting on it. I'm happy to be\na tester. Like I said, on this episode\nthere will be no stuntmen or no stunt doubles needed. I'll be here\nto try my own product. I love my job. I love waking up\ngoing to work every day, and so this is another\npart of going to work. Meeting people like you\nthat are so forward thinking. \u266a\u266a 2 Chainz. \u266a\u266a", "xccbd2vkQRE": "what is up cannafam and welcome back to another video so check it out guys for this video i'm gonna be taking some edibles i said it i'm gonna do it i i know i know before we get into this i know that oregon edibles are pretty much almost trash okay i'm just gonna be honest like look let's just be honest let's just call a spade a spade oregon edibles are not that good okay they may taste great you may find some good ones that taste super delicious and awesome and you know all fancy and whatnot but the fact of the matter is 50 milligram uh limit for recreational here in the state of oregon is [ __ ] it is [ __ ] okay it is 110 [ __ ] if you are somebody that's needing higher dosage if you are a medical patient that's needing a higher dosage um you have to buy like multiple packs and [ __ ] like that's ridiculous that's ridiculous not only is buying just multiple of these super expensive you know but you can get diabetes i should you not just because it has wheat in it doesn't mean you can't get diabetes it's just a bunch of junk food all right so for this video if you haven't guessed already we got edibles okay so uh i have three 50 milligram uh rice krispie bites these are little bites rice krispies i got two chocolate one regular and then i also have um two gummies here by buddies all right these are like little square gummies that you can eat and again each of these have 50 milligrams in it so we got 100 250 milligrams and that's what we're going to take this morning now i know there might be some people on here that are like bruh i take like a thousand milligrams this ain't [ __ ] this is weak sauce whatever okay i get it i i i'd have to spend like probably close to 50 or more bucks if i wanted 100 milligrams so uh i'm just dealing with 250 uh now um i have not smoked at all this is it's early in the morning it's still eight o'clock in the morning um i have not smoked i haven't taken any dabs haven't smoked any flour haven't done any of that so um this is going to be my first high of the day i wanted to do this so i could actually try to feel the effects okay because i have a high tolerance um usually you know a couple hundred milligrams doesn't really affect me much okay you really don't really feel it much but um nonetheless we will we will take these edibles all right so we got the two here we got the cherry and we got the watermelon uh this watermelon is shishka berry blue dream terps and it is an indica with 45 milligrams 45 what the [ __ ] not even a full 50 what the [ __ ] uh this one is shishkenberry and pineapple terps and this is also an indica and this is the cherry okay and 45 or some percent 45 milligrams on this as well so technically not the full 50 that's kind of bunk that's kind of [ __ ] to me um the fact that you can't get a it's 50 milligrams it's it's 50. like come on like what the [ __ ] dude it's already not that much to begin with and now it's even less oh that that's already an automatic strike in my book i'm sorry you could sit here and argue well it's hard to get animals to 50 and i don't give a [ __ ] i'll give a [ __ ] what your reason story or excuses [ __ ] that 50 milligrams come on it's not that much guys we're paying this amount for this kind of [ __ ] anyway 50 milligrams one of these gummies ain't gonna do [ __ ] to most owners both of these gummies honestly you can most most cannabis users most daily cannabis users can eat both of these and they're not gonna feel [ __ ] this isn't gonna do [ __ ] okay that's the problem and one of the reasons is is because it's not the full milligrams it's always [ __ ] some kind of percent shot it's either 40 45 whatever just get the 50. that's the point i'm trying to make [ __ ] all right eating me my emo kids try everybody so let's go with this one watermelon all right so i really do like watermelon and um it's probably one of my favorite flavors to be honest open this up got a nice little squishy gummy look at that nice little squishy gummy sugared nice little gummy let's do it [Music] not bad not bad at all very easy goes down smooth like um it's not hard very chewy i like it however the watermelon flavor you kind of get it at first but it goes away really fast and then you're kind of stuck with like a dab flavor almost i don't know that's crazy um i wonder if it says what they use i'm wondering if they use um like bho or rso or distillate i'm wondering what they make or how they made this product but it doesn't tell me on the back here on all the information here on the back unfortunately that kind of sucks all right so cherry and it's again pretty much the same you know nice and soft chewy sugar coated [Music] um the cherry flavor was a little bit stronger than the watermelon not by much not by much but just a little bit stronger on the flavor than the watermelon so that's not bad now uh for these buddies uh one one gummy uh edibles uh i paid six dollars a gram for the cram i paid six dollars a gram i paid six dollars in edible for this okay you guys can see that up here at the top six dollars which i guess isn't bad for like a nice little bite size edible but still i remember when um 50 milligrams used to be like five bucks i don't know but anyway i guess that's close six bucks right so that's that's pretty much close you're paying the extra dollar for the packaging that's what it is you pay the five dollars for the 50 milligrams and then you pay the extra dollar for the packaging so we figured it out anyway let's get on to these crispies all right guys so i think um what we're gonna do here is since we only have one of the regular i think we're gonna save this for last and we'll probably start with these chocolates right here so these are bite-sized rice krispie treats which i kind of prefer them to be bite-sized to be honest just because i don't want to eat for if it was more milligrams if it was like a hundred two three four hundred whatever [ __ ] milligrams i wouldn't mind eating you know normal-sized rice krispies but for just 50 [ __ ] milligrams like yeah it needs to be bite-sized okay it needs to be just good now i got my milligrams all right so these are also are they all yep oh no this one's 47 okay so this is 47 milligrams these are 45. so again same complaint as the last ones what the [ __ ] okay what the [ __ ] can a crispy like what the [ __ ] work harder at getting to that 50 milligram i'm sorry and again i know there'll be some people that will comment and be like well dude you don't make edibles you don't know what you're talking about it's it's super hard to get exactly 50 on point blah blah blah blah blah we're not allowed to be one over i don't give a [ __ ] okay all that [ __ ] that you say is just reason stories and excuses to me okay just get it handled just do it it's 50 milligrams it's not that [ __ ] hard okay this is as far as edible goes that's all we can get like stop depriving us of what we need all right so again we're gonna do the chocolate first save the regular for last now these are also six dollars for edible so that's not too bad all right all right nice little square oh i want to talk with my mouth full these are good you don't really taste any of the the dabs or weed or whatever they use for this um however it is a little dry like it is a i don't want to say stale because it's not it's not stale it doesn't taste that way but it is a little dry man it just sucks it just sucks i have to eat all this you know what i mean it just sucks and i have to eat all this because a it's for it you know it's early still in the morning to be eating a bunch of sugar this early in the morning it's gonna be rough um and and b it's like so many pieces of sugar you know what i mean like i have to sit here and eat five pieces and [ __ ] i mean i just um i just wish that you know you could get like one of these just one just like this but it'd be the 250 300 milligrams that we're trying to get here sucks so if you're in a state if you are in a state that has edibles that go above you know 50 or 100 consider yourself lucky okay don't take that [ __ ] for granted because you could be in the state of oregon and even though yeah we have you know good dabs and uh good flour and stuff like that and good prices we have the best prices in the nation um edible game is [ __ ] don't come here for edibles okay you're gonna be highly disappointed if you're an edible person if that's your main stick and you come here you you take the trip you spend all that money come here for edibles and then you realize 50 milligrams not even 45 milligrams and um yeah you got to buy like 10 of them that's crazy it's not bad but you can definitely um have some kind of like a oh always some kind of dab taste i want to say like distill it i don't know but you can definitely there's like a funky little aftertaste with it oh it's not bad but that part was a little hard doubly hmm on that one damn so the chocolates taste okay it's not super chocolaty but you know i mean it does taste like a cocoa rice krispie treat now regular flavor rice krispie treats are some of my favorite okay they're probably one of my favorite type of edibles i also love brownies so rice krispie treats and brownies are probably my favorite edibles although there you can you can medicate almost anything so i mean to be able to have like super delicious food medicated that is awesome um let me know in the comment section below on this video what your favorite edible is okay what is your favorite kind of edible and not only that but let me know what is the highest milligram of edible that you've ever had in your life what is the highest milligrams you have ever taken for me the highest milligram is 1600. um if you if you're willing to scroll down way you know years like probably 2015 it's yeah years years if you're willing to scroll through years of videos you'll find the edible video we did um on the edible lollipop that was 1600 milligrams so that's probably the highest i've ever taken but anyway cheers guys much love you know what's funny is you eat right you eat edibles and then maybe in like 30 40 minutes you're hungry like super hungry you're like [ __ ] i just ate some bunch of edibles and just ate like [ __ ] bunch of edibles but um i could definitely eat a pizza and a steak and some chips right now anyway i just thought that was funny it's a little rough some parts come on finally okay here we go it is all now in my gullet and now we have to wait for the effects all right now i will do like a follow-up i know uh anytime i've done edible videos there's always some people complaining like hey this guy got so high he forgot to even follow up and tell us how it was you know what i mean and that's not the case i guarantee you that um what it mainly is is in my other videos if i don't come back and do like a follow-up and be like hey guys i'm [ __ ] high this is great um it means that i didn't feel it it means that i didn't get me high i know that uh i've done these can of crispy video i've done a video on these can of crispies before and um i know there's some people on there they're like hey why didn't you follow up with us we wanted to know how the high was and it's because it didn't really get me that high and that's not knocking the edibles that's not saying that you know the 50 milligrams whatever uh that's just saying like hey i need more than 150 200 milligrams in order to feel it so well i feel at this time i don't know this is one of the things that i made sure that i didn't smoke anything i didn't no dabs no flour no none of that this morning straight edibles so that way if i am gonna feel it it's gonna be now you know what i mean like there's no other better time that in the morning before you've had anything else to you know take some edibles and get the true effects of the edibles the true effects and um yeah so we take them all or we took them all we take them took them whatever um but yeah they're all gone and um yeah we're gonna see how this feels so i will do a follow-up even if it doesn't affect me i will still do a follow-up and i'll just be like hey guys look i'm i'm still just me just sober so anyway be sure to

take indica edibles okay indica dominant edibles in the morning make sure you get those sativas like seriously that was uh that was quite an experience i mean i know i know it was only 250 milligrams i know that's not a lot to some people however uh taking it first thing in the morning before smoking anything else and all that kind of stuff and the fact that it was indica like they were indica edibles indica dominant that was a mistake i'll probably never make again like i'm gonna be honest like i just passed out probably about an hour and a half after taking all the edibles i was just like you know what i mean like i was like whoa indica [ __ ] um but nonetheless they uh were pretty good edibles especially for the price so 6.50 milligrams that's not too bad so let me know what you guys think in the comment section below the high was nice they did do the job uh it kind of sucks that you got to take so many of them but they did do the job um so yeah that is my full review on the

peace out and much love", "cjQJx2fHaDg": "thank you for joining us for another episode of inside Saints today we will be showing you how to medicate using edibles [Music] hi my name is Tim I'm a manager here Saints I wanted to talk to you about edibles a little bit today the trick with edibles it is finding the right dose unlike smoking when you take an edible you don't feel the effects right away it usually takes about 45 minutes to an hour sometimes even longer before you actually feel the effect so the trick with edibles is to find out what's the right dose for you and then not take too much the nice thing about edibles is that when you take it it won't wear off as quickly as smoking on the effects will last about five to six hours so I find that they're really good for sleep because I can take one before I go to bed and it will last the whole night I'll get a really good night's sleep I'll wake up feeling refreshed let me show you this is the Bigfoot bar it's a chocolate bar by Uncle herbs this is the dark chocolate and one I like this one because it's easy to dose let me show you one so I just we have a chocolate bar and they divide it up into 10 little squares so you can break these squares off each square is about 10 milligrams so generally 10 milligrams one of these is what I recommend is a starting dose if you're not sure what's a good dose for you it's kind of a safe bet to go with 10 milligrams if you're someone who's a little bit nervous about it or if you're just someone who is affected really strongly by different medications you might even want to break one of those in half and just start with five milligrams so these you can try to break them off into different sections like a Hershey's bar they're kind of scored so one of these is just a good starting dose you want to take it and then wait at least an hour before you take more what happens with some people's they'll take it to wait 23 minutes not feel anything and take more and then by the time it actually kicks in it's been what they've had too much so butter balls are a little tricky because it once you do take too much you're kind of stuck on that train for the next five or six hours so if you do find yourself in that since you where you're a little bit too - edibles it's good to just drink lots of water maybe lay down take a nap taking a shower often helps or CBD can help calm down if you're feeling a little bit of anxiety from too much THC so in general edibles are really nice just because the longer effect a lot of people also have success with edibles that they have lung issues and can't really smoke elbows are a nice way to use the cannabis without damaging your lungs in further so in general I really love edibles and they're great for sleep they're great for that longer duration and there's lots of different lots of different ways there's a lot of different candies and stuff personally I like we have some that are more of like a salty snack but there's some pretzels there's some Chex Mix lots of different options so there's something for everyone thanks for joining us today don't forget to Like and subscribe below join us next time for another episode of

marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary I've got my trusty spatula and my trusty thing in Nutella why do I have these you might be asking if you have not tuned into one of these before it means I am reviewing gummies and the reason I have this Nutella is so that I can have a little bit of fact before I eat these gummies I find that having a little bit of fat in your system before consuming gummies enhances the high of that gumming so let's just take a little lick of Nutella here the best part about any edible review because who doesn't love just some freaking Nutella all right that should be that should do it for my fats now what kind of gummy are we reviewing we are reviewing lol edibles candy I have actually had a couple people asked me to review this I reviewed one lol edible product in the past that I did not like very much the Elwha edibles flamin hot cheetos this here is a candy it is blueberries our belts Meghnath be gorilla glue glue hybrid so you can see on the back they've got a plea to add them on social media they've got a missing lot ID batch number and best before date not on there so we don't know if we're gonna be doing okay says do not mix with alcohol first time I've ever seen that I don't exactly know why you shouldn't mix the two other than you don't like getting crunked but uh who cares I am really hoping this lol edibles redeems not only lol edibles which he's a really dumb name I mean it's just a colossal II stupid name I'm hoping it not only redeems them but also gummies in general if you've never really seen weeks before I have never been a huge fan of gummies or candies I finally get you less high than the confectionery edibles but maybe this will be the one that turns it around we shall see alright so let's open this up here these blueberries sour ropes alright that is a strong weed odor very strong you will smell that from a distance away as I think so be careful opening this somewhere in a closed area where you don't want people smoking weed because that has a very strong weed odor as do these ropes themselves these look a lot like the Buddhist hours which I've had in the past and reviewed hmm there's a considerable weed taste to them not overwhelming the sourness definitely helps not as sour as the Buddhist hours but still pretty sour with a stronger weed flavor so hopefully that means they're more potent than the the Voodoo sours Oh sure if I mention this this is a 300 milligram animal should should be pretty potent but then again gummies your mileage right back again fairly strong we taste but the sourness really helps them overcoming with it all right guys so I'm gonna finish these here off-camera I'm not gonna bore you to death eating you all these things here in front of you and I will be back in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because as always that is the most important part of any edible review all right guys please please please wish me luck let's hope these are better than our gummies in the past and ll WA edibles in the past and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know the results thank you so much for watching weights we'll see you soon peace guys I am happy to report that while not perfect and while not my first choice in any of the categories lol edibles the candy blue ropes blue berry ropes blue gummi ropes are are a nice little revelation they are not the most powerful 300 milligram edible I've ever had they're not the most tasty gummy I've ever had but I would say they are probably my new favorite gummy I am I do feel quite high not as high as I would be on a 300 mm gram confectionery edible like say akarova for example but that's a comparing you know something with like the best of the best I guess it's substantially better than their flamin hot cheeto knockoff that I had a while ago so you know it might be a combination of lowered expectations I was also a little tired going to this review so that might also be contributing to like my feelings of being high but overall I'm I'm I'm pleasantly surprised I know I used that phrase a lot but this was a welcome surprise I I had two strikes going against it one being lol edibles which I had a bad experience with and being a gummy which I've mostly found to be disappointing and I found it to be okay so that's you know that's good that's good I would not probably buy this again but if you are a fan of gummy edibles or if you really like sour gummies this is certainly better than the Voodoo candies I've had which are 375 milligram anibal's you might want to go and pick this up but for me it's it's a nice little surprise so thank you so much for watching weeks guys that's my dog walking in and we will check you out on the next review peace hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "9byEOvA8-0w": "hello everyone we are back yet again with another week's review it is time for a week's mini review where we help you make sense of your dispensary and in these mini reviews we take smaller size edibles this is a 200 milligram edible and review them in a smaller format than traditional instead of our 30 6120 I just come back with you guys at two hours later and let you know how we're feeling so today we are reviewing something that we have never reviewed before a new brand this is from mcclenney confections quality you can taste and feel we shall see as you said this is a 200 milligram edible handcrafted cannabis nougat and caramel dark Belgian chocolate and it's the dark sneakers I guess kind of like Snickers except dum sounding all-natural ingredients whatever that means 1 to 8 servings we're just gonna have one serving and it says at the top the portions of a portion of donations go to animal shelters in need which is great ok it's got kind of this fancy plastic packaging just sort of unique I've never seen packaging like this for an edible nicely sort of floral rounders just got this odd plastic packaging let's open it up see how difficult is this it's not so bad inside maybe the slightest slightest hint of marijuana smell but nothing that's gonna get you busted that's for sure more of a dark chocolate aroma as it says but let's go to try okay and it's pretty good you can see the nougat and caramel inside there wow that is pretty tasty it tastes kind of like a dark chocolate Snickers bar without peanuts it's good it's very good um I'm eating it refrigerated so it's a little cruel but I like it that way I could get it and suggest you try it that way so in terms of taste Wow those consumed excuse me this gets high marks for taste but the proof is in how high this is gonna give me this this family at 200 milligrams only cost me I believe seven bucks is pretty affordable but we will check back with you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling thanks for watching Leakes hi guys I'm back it has been two hours since I had the dark sneakers chocolate bar from mcclenney confections I've really enjoyed it this bad boy only costs me six bucks maybe seven bucks can't remember exactly which but it's a hell of a value good tasting really enjoy the taste no discernible marijuana taste whatsoever I'm pretty quality chocolate I think and over two hours later I'm still feeling pretty stoned so if you see a dark sneakers at a dispensary near you go ahead and grab one you're not going to be disappointed thanks so much for watching wheats we'll check you guys out on the next review", "2VNYCOaQFSY": "[Music] hopefully 71 the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on this web view we are taking a look at the final product to review from a cushy punch their 100 milligram sativa variety flavor is strawberries the strawberry 100 milligram sativa variety of cushy punch we've looked at their 200 milligram TK o which I found to be kind of lacking and then we looked at their 100 milligram indica and in an experiment we also look at the 100 milligram hybrids and I found both of those to be not too bad so I hope that this is on the better end of the cushy punch I hope it's as good as the other two 100 milligrams I found those to be much better than the 200 milligram sort of surprisingly I would just go with 100 milligrams in terms of cost because I think it's about just about as potent as its 200 milligram brother so without further ado let's going to open this up and eat her down and what's gonna happen after that guys after I finish this I'm going to come back to you in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part about the edible review not necessarily how it tastes but more about how it actually makes you feel so here we go looks like a like a little jam packet or a little jelly packet or a little butter packet it's got four little blocks in there and after we get it plopped out you can see it with its four a little squares but we're going to ignore the little squares there just plug the whole thing in my mouth and one go mmm not bad definitely a little bit of what we taste so much better than the infused creations or the what's the other one I can't remember the name off the top my head but any of those ones that are just like the gummy bears with the basically just like THC oil sprinkled on the outside this is a lot better this is more like the flourish although I don't think it's quite as good as the flourish so now that I've slurped it down I'm gonna wait two hours to see how I'm gonna feel you guys however have to just wait a couple seconds I'll be back right after this break here and I'll let you know how I'm feeling see you then it's been two hours since I had the cushy punch that's the name of it the cushy punch should sieve a hundred milligram THC strawberry flavored gummy here and I gotta say this might be the least hi I've been from one of their hundred milligrams it seemed like the hybrid and the indica hit me more that might just be because I've heard this about um because she punched before that they're not the most consistent some are code and some aren't and that might just be the case with this sativa I'm not not high just more at like four four and a half somewhere in that range instead of the six five and a half six is the other ones so a little bit less than before but again that just might be this particular batch where it might be that sativa doesn't quite hit me as hard but it still is better than my original impressions of could she punch way back when when I had their TKO at the very very beginning I still don't think it would be the first thing I reached for at the dispensary but it won't be the last thing I go for like my opinion used to be so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching it as always and we will see you on the next review peace okay", "wSDwefu92VU": "[Music] we help you make sense of your dispensary welcome to weeds guys on on today's review we are taking another look at a product from the fine folks at the Venice cookie Co and today we're taking a look at their I assume compliant with the new edible regulations taking effect this July their cannabis infused dark chocolate sea salt vegan no gluten 10 mini so there are 10 minis of whatever these little chocolate bars things are we've reviewed I think these are the people that make cannabis quencher and they also make the 420 bars which are really good and this is their new minis line here again probably can plant with those regulations on the back everything you want to see a product testing provided by SC labs love seeing that nutrition information ingredients all that fun stuff and a lot of text to get through that I'm not gonna read peace-loving cannabis that's all you need to know so this has the annoying new packaging they their instructions are to grip rip and enjoy will see if I can actually get that to happen I doubt it this new packaging is the worst Korova uses it I think Hanako now uses it it just it really sucks and their grip rip and enjoy is not precisely helpful alright guys I'm gonna have to go uh maybe grab like there's a tear thing but is that going to help no why do they even option offer the option to tear I'm gonna have to go grab some scissors I'll be right back defeat it and I'm back that was a bit of a pain in the ass I understand they have to do this but I am too stupid for this kind of packaging so here we go here are the minis right here it'll a lot like their candy bars just sort of broken up into ten little mini now this is the again the dark chocolate and sea salt let's give it a taste oh very salty well I gotta say I think that's too salty for me I'm normally like the dark chocolate sea salt combination but damn there is a lot of salted here whoo but the chocolate itself is a pretty good quality I feel and very little cannabis taste mainly just because it's covered up by that salty flavor whoo yeah way too much salt good well oh why why would you do that the rare edible where the taste is not bad due to the cannabis it's due to a different ingredient not my favorite but as we always know it's not about how it tastes it's more about how it makes you feel and for that guys I'm gonna finish off the rest of these minis although I'm not really looking forward to it and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review process all right guys what I'm gonna polish off these hundred milligrams cannabis infused dark chocolate sea salt and I will see you guys in just a bit peace [Music] welcome back awaits guys it's been two hours since I had the oh whoops there we go the Venice cookie Co cannabis infused dark chocolate and sea salt hundred milligrams here and although the edible had way way way way way way way too much salt in it I ain't even salty because damn it hits hard this is another win for the Venice cookie Co really really pleased with how it feels I I'm at like a seven or so for one hundred milligram edible which is pretty good I like this one quite a bit and it cost me exactly ten bucks I think my dispensary you know I think it was twelve so you know decent for a hundred milligram edible especially a chocolate one I said I like this one quite a bit I would definitely recommend it if you can find out at a fair price especially if your dispensary is now only stocking these hundred milligram edibles if this is the time of a hundred milligram edibles only if you're watching this then yeah then yes I recommend this one go for it so uh yeah I'm I'm pleased with it if this is our future if it contains edibles as good as this well it's far from ideal it's not gonna be the hellscape I once thought it was so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you guys on the next review peace", "uSk7mbWYDBA": "[Music] [Music] hello I'm Laura Cassaday from the American Chemical Society welcome to this news briefing from the ACS fall 2019 national meeting in San Diego we're joined today by dr. David Dawson from C D CW analytical laboratories he's studying how chocolate metals cannabis potency testing dr. Dawson Thank You Laura so just to give a quick overview of my research as she said my research focuses on matrix effects in cannabis infused chocolate products so in my role its research principle in @cw analytical which is a third party cannabis testing lab in Oakland California we have to test a wide variety of products with precision and accuracy for our clients who are cannabis producers so in order to provide the best testing methods my research has kind of involved some of the more complex and unusual product types that we get and my research that I started on and that I'm presenting here focuses on cannabis infused chocolates which are fair a fairly ubiquitous product type very accessible to people maybe not familiar with commercial cannabis products and these are typically formulated just by buying commercial chocolate combining in cannabis concentrate in some form or another and then molding that resulting slurry to get a cannabis infused chocolate product and I we decided to first look at this not only for its ubiquity but also just for the fact that we noticed some kind of anecdotal variance in the potency values we would get for testing these chocolate bars and it seemed a little peculiar so we wanted to kind of investigate that it turns out also that chocolate is a very complex food matrix there's not a lot of or any research on cannabinoid analyte testing and complex food matrices but there is analogous work on the field of allergens and with that work they go so far as to say the chocolate is one of the more difficult food matrices to test because it has high fats polyphenols tannins it's a veritable organic soup of compounds so it actually is a very complex matrix from which to test thank you so the main crux of my investigation focused on sample prep which is to say how much chocolate we are testing and kind of how much solvent we are adding to that was that was kind of my baseline investigation and here you can see a comparison of 1,000 milligrams of ground-up chocolate that we test versus a 2,000 milligram sample size you can see on the x-axis we have a range of solvent volumes that solvent is methanol kind of our workhorse solvent and you can see on the y-axis is average calculated potency of the chocolate bar so that is you know what is client-facing that is or customer-facing that is how strong that chocolate is and you can see in blue we have the 1000 milligram preps and in red we have the 2000 milligram preps and you can see that for each solvent volume the 1000 milligram sample loadings gave higher calculated potent disease so that's rather surprising that definitely goes against what I would consider basic statistical representation samples where if you had theoretically if you have more chocolate in a vial you should be getting a more representative idea of the sample but it does seem here that we are actually getting less accurate and less precise data when we are prepping it with more chocolate in the vial so that's very surprising there could be a variety of factors one of the questions may be was incomplete extraction things like that so I devised another experiment to kind of test that thank you so this is an experiment where I made a stock solution of THC in methanol so I knew how much THC was in the solvent that was the get-go and you can see that data point at the zero grams of chocolate it intersects the y-axis at about 103 that's kind of the baseline and then in this experiment I took chocolate that was made by the same cannabis producer but was there virgin undos chocalate products but it's the exact same product and just no cannabis and added that in one two and three gram amounts to that solution of a known amount of cannabinoids and you can see here in the blue line is the undos milk in the orange line is under dark you can see that it's pretty linear that once you get past that one gram mark we start to see decreased recovery of the Delta 9 THC which is consistent with the chocolate itself is capturing containing suppressing the signal that we are measuring of THC and you note that also that effect is essentially minimized at one gram and it only really kicks in at higher concentrations obviously my main talk goes into a little more detail than this but these are kind of the central thrusts that show that seemed to suggest that chocolate is causing signal interference when we're trying to measure a cannabinoid analytes great thank you dr. Dawson are there any questions please state your name and affiliation before asking your question Katie Cottingham American Chemical Society so why is this kind of testing important what are kind of the outcomes of of an incorrect analysis or incorrect result that you're getting and they data point yes so as far as California law is concerned of course we're in Oakland so we are following the Bureau of cannabis control which is California's governing body they have set forth restrictions on potency testing for what is required to pass your potency test and what that is is a label claim will come in on the product so a hundred milligrams is a very normal label claim the product has to test within plus or minus 10% of that stated label claim so that theoretical 100 milligram chocolate bar would pass if a tests above a 90 and below above a 90 milligram result and below a 110 milligram result so there's a bit of a window where you can get into and that will pass however if it fails low as we call it where it comes in below that 90 percent mark the product has to be relabeled every unit in the batch has to be relabeled that can be done by hand by the producers as we are still such a nascent industry the kind of infrastructure isn't really fully there so that is a big kind of financial hit it can make the product look not as good which again in early days of the industry trying to establish a brand identity is very important and having to sticker over or hand write on your label is not great if it fails high however so it's above that hundred ten percent mark the product is not deemed fit for consumption in California and you cannot sell it so that's an even worse financial and position so this phenomena that I'm documenting here doesn't really I'll say it does not pose a public health concern it's not that crazy of a dosage difference between the potential label claim but it can certainly erroneously give a fail low because as we note it is a signal suppression effect so the actual chocolate bar might be you know five percent stronger than what the values are if this comes into play so it might erroneously trigger a fail for the producers which would cause them to have two real able when in fact that just might be an analytical quirk that you know has not necessarily been documented or that we're aware of so that can dramatically affect their entire product Lots and do you know what particular component is causing this effect I have a hunch I would say ongoing research is trying to prove that I'm an organic chemist by training so of course my mind is wondering what the actual molecular interactions are causing it part of my presentation I do try to tease it apart by testing different chocolate products that have different chocolate components as I call them I tested cocoa powder baking chocolate white chocolate all of which have different amounts of fat and cocoa powders my current hunch is that it does have to do with the fats that is also not a crazy assumption to make when you're making edibles at home you have to stew the cannabis flour in butter to extract the cannabinoids because the cannabinoids have to go into the fats for certain drug tests you can be they can tell if you have cannabinoids in your system from the last month because your body stores them in your body fat so it's not crazy to think that if you are providing a source of fat such as this unde oast chocolate there might be some equilibrium coefficient where then cannabinoids in solution are being attracted to the fats and that that might be the cause Rebecca Trager with chemistry world I'm assuming that in a broader sense this says uh-uh this doesn't just have to do with chocolate what is the larger issue here in terms of edibles and testing and potency and so forth yes so of course this research is fairly narrow right now it is just looking at chocolates and fairly simple chocolates not chocolates with any sort of additional components or inclusions in them but that is definitely a great question because if indeed it is related to the fats of course chocolate is not the only cannabis product with fat in it therefore a analogous phenomena might be occurring with cookies with brownies topicals definitely are kind of a fatty emulsion product to any of the complex fat based products might be having some effect similar to this and that definitely is going to be a focus of ongoing research they'll boost like yes I was a little confused about when we were talking about potency test testing because I was assuming that it's it's it's an effect on people rather than then then analytical problems with recovery of of added material and so forth would you like to elaborate a little bit of how much much pre-processing are you doing doing when you're trying to recover that thing like are you chromatographic that stuff and getting it into my spec or what what is it there there are ways and means to to get rid of matrices matrix effects a chromatography happens to be one of those yes so our process involves a few different stages of sample prep definitely the product is grind ground down to a fine powder it is then sonicated insolvent vortexed we do centrifuge it and put it in the freezer then to essentially winterize it to crash some dissolved fats out and then we filter it and analyze it we use high pressure liquid chromatography as our instrument of choice that's very standard throughout the cannabis industry for potency testing right now and yes definitely cleaning up the matrix effects is the ultimate goal from this because this research right now is very much establishing that there is a phenomena going on here and then we will continue to work forward to clean up the matrix effects I know that we can borrow a page from food science and food analysis labs as this is you know they have a lot of tools with which to deal with complex matrices then at present we are this research and particularly this does show that we are getting above 99% recovery when we use smaller sample sizes that's kind of a band-aid at this point we are able to kind of with more confidence report data with the smaller sample sizes and obviously a larger goal is to actually alleviate the problem completely but as of now we are working towards that well I presume at the moment there are no a always see procedures for for recovery of this these things so I mean that's usually the the way it's going to happen but so at the very very beginning of all this it's very frustrated not having any standardized methods or anything from lab to lab state-to-state it is still very much the early primordial days of this for sure thank you very much thank you Mike Lawrence from ACS dr. Dawson just want to clarify one thing you said earlier that really jumped out not a public health concern so you're saying if I'm hearing you correctly that the variation between the actual lay Mount of THC and the reality of it based on the things you found is not so wide that people are going to be getting wildly higher than they expected because of the THC amounts in the in the in the chocolate that is correct it very much is more of an issue for producers but I mean if we just look at this data we're getting essentially a hundred and one milligrams from a one gram sample prep and ninety eight milligrams from two so that's below a five percent difference between the two values so that would be kind of analogous to what a difference between potential label claim and potential product would be for a consumer so I think you would have to be only the most seasoned cannabis consumer to detect a difference between oh this this chocolate bar says it's a hundred but it feels like it's 96 that's not gonna be enough that it's going to put anyone in danger you know at most you're getting five percent more cannabinoids than is on the label I don't think that is going to you know dramatically affect anyone and what it should affect for the consumer is that they I hope that this at least makes them aware of the complexities of testing these and that we are always improving in our testing methods in the legal market and I do think that you know this type of research can help progress confidence in the commercial cannabis market which is obviously very new and that the labs are on top of these things but no there's no public health concern nobody is going to be dramatically having too much cannabinoids compared to the label claim from this phenomena and again if I heard you correctly it's failing low more often than failing high yes because this is a signal suppression effect you might be getting erroneously low values but those values are not going to be more than five or so percent low last quick question if your company that's putting labels on chocolate on THC infused chocolate what's your message to those companies about the certainty of whatever label they put on it I would say always do R&D on your products a lot of cannabis producers want to get their products to market as fast as possible obviously the industry is also two years removed in California from black market so kind of the full R&D proper research protocols are kind of developing doing R&D to establish your product into really so there are no surprises that's very useful and again you know using trusted labs who are at the cutting edge of the industry and of testing is also very good so that you know you are sending it to people who know what they're doing and not just you know kind of going off the cuff okay we have some online questions salah Eldon is asking is there any difference between using white or a darker chocolate like a brown chocolate there is not a substantial difference I did do this experiment and it is presented in my full presentation they behave similarly and I do believe their differences are related to the actual you know individual makeups of dark and white chocolate I have not tested cannabis infused white chocolates though so I cannot fully make a statement on that I do imagine it would have a very similar effect as to the darker chocolates okay and another question from Brian things are they're known ingredients that tend to throw the measurements off more reliably I guess have you found other ingredients that might yes so in my the chocolate components I was worried that maybe it would be some of the complex organic flavoring molecules that are part of the naturally extracted cocoa solids that those might be having some sort of interaction my chocolate component screen as I ran seemed to disprove that the presence of cocoa solids did not seem to be fully indicative of a suppression effect it does seem to be more tied to the fats again there can be teased out more specifically because in chocolate there's multiple there's the natural fats associated with the chocolate and the extraction there's added milk fats of course there's added sugars so there can be a variety of different fats and solution the specificity of which we are not sure of and of course this is still just a educated hunch right now that fats are the issue so dr. Dawson in these slides you were looking at a THC potency measuring THC potency do you have any indication that CBD might also show this weird matrix suppression effect that's a follow-up experiment that I'm working on because of course this is limited to just the main cannabinoid if you would the main psychoactive cannabinoid I would be very interested to see if it is general of all cannabinoids or if it is you know I think it would be even more interesting if it was just THC that affected this I believe if my fat hypothesis is correct I think that should be then a trend of all cannabinoids as all cannabinoids behave fairly similarly in that case but of course we won't know until we actually do that research ok any other questions all right thank you please join us for our next press conference at 1:00 p.m. chipping away and how are you [Music] you [Music]", "X4O60iQXJho": "[Music] 500 milligram lead cereal bars for 12 bucks 300 milligrams of bags of chips for 10 400 milligram breakfast cereals we breakfast cereals for $11 and not only that but all the products are pretty tasty too this is just a small sampling of the great value you can expect from lol edibles and nearly ubiquitous edible manufacturer here in Southern California sounds too good to be true right well that's because it is welcome to wheats everyone the marijuana edible review show where we do our damndest to help you make sense of your dispensary this is a show where we try to save you from throwing away your hard-earned money on dud ass edibles and speaking of gun ass edibles today we're going to take a deeper look at LOL edibles where LOL presumably stands for lies on lies we have reviewed a variety of LOL products on wheats and so far have found them to be all greatly exaggerating their potency LOL edibles conveniently does not have an independent tasting testing laboratory rate their product or if they do they do not display it anywhere on their products packaging or on its the website without an independent testing body there are seemingly free to make up whatever dosage they want to put on their packaging and while I certainly cannot prove at this time they are exaggerating their potency my extensive experience with high potency edibles leads me to believe that they are full of [ __ ] so one of the cardinal rules of edibles is you get what you pay for with a few exceptions and we pay $10 for an edible that claims to have 400 milligrams of THC unless you see that independent laboratory verifying those results I would be pretty skeptical of that claim and lol edibles is the king of these shitty shenanigans an another tip-off that they may be less than honest is the taste of their products they usually print is pretty great but a 500 milligram edible should taste at least a little terrible these don't why well most likely because they're lying about how much THC is actually in the product let's compare them to say a 500 milligram kuroh an\u00edbal the kirova product will likely cost and double the lol edible or more and it will taste far Wars and while this might sound weird to say that's very much a good thing two hours after eating an lol a 500 milligram lol edible I'm stone-cold sober like a lifetime lifetime teetotaler but two hours after a 500 milligram Korova edible and I'm [ __ ] over the moon and probably under my covers passed out asleep so let's go back and talk about their website again it's [ __ ] laughable and that's four tabs products about contact and order there order tab seems to it seemed seems to be in good working condition which makes sense because I see this [ __ ] everywhere everything else on their website though god damn what a [ __ ] show the products tab only Keynes contains a small sliver of their products and the pictures look like they were taken on a crusty iphone 3gs by some bored seven-year-old the contact tab of course doesn't do a goddamn thing it's a completely dead link no way to contact them on their contact me tab my guess never worked they don't really want you to contact them they know you're pissed at them why don't they want to hear from you and actually if you really really really do want to get ahold of them just look at the bottom of their page and there's a link to their email and Instagram so you can contact them there psyche those are dead links too they just want you to think that they're able to be contacted but they don't really want you to know they're your feedback because they know they [ __ ] you they know that they're lying to you and they know that you're pissed they don't want to hear from you and finally let's talk about that about page that shows up on their website here's what it says on I quote the medical cannabis industry needed a well respected brand of edibles that patients can rely on for quality and reliability while tasting great lol edibles aims to take the industry by storm by providing great customer service and amazing products you can find LOL edibles throughout the Los Angeles Orange County and San Diego regions at fine reputable medical dispensaries ask your dispensary for LOL edibles today what a load of [ __ ] horseshit let's take that sentence-by-sentence here so I agree that the medical cannabis industry needs a well respected brand but lol edibles sure as [ __ ] ain't it they have the audacity to say that patients can rely on their quality and reliability they also brag about their customer service you know the one you can't actually reach out to or get in contact with them in any way shape or form so guys ask your dispensary the opposite ask them to stop selling these products tell them they are inadvertently ripping off their customers or maybe intentionally ripping off their customers I don't know the only true thing about that sentence or excuse me about that about page is that you can find them throughout LA and Orange counties as unfortunate as that is so I've tried the majority of the Ella Buhl's products but not all I will confess I've never tried their boob cubes or G bars but you know what at this point I never will and I don't care if they're actually good these guys have taken enough money from the pocket of consumers wheats will never review any of their products again their name is lol edibles but the only one are laughs the only ones laughing are them and they're laughing all the way to the bank let me just be totally here to click totally totally clear here to wrap up do not buy any lol edibles products do not let your friends buy their [ __ ] tell your dispensary not to carry this [ __ ] garbage leave them a negative review on weed maps and let's all work together to put these scumbags out of business thanks guys so much for watching this

Like mercury where ingesting a 200 milligram dose would kill you. Or polonium which only requires 1 g of vaporized substance to wipe out 50 million people! But did know that 70 cups of coffee contains enough caffeine to kill a 70 kg person? This amount of caffeine can trigger heart palpitations or even cardiac arrest. Prefer alcohol as your beverage of choice? 13 consecutive shots could be lethal too. Because alcohol is a depressant, the area in the brain controlling basic life functions like breathing and heart rate brgin to shut down. Too much liquid in general can be dangerous as well. Though it takes a lot, water intoxication from around 6 liters causes brain cells to swell, leading to headaches, seizures, comas and even death in extreme cases. But if you stop drinking water or consume too much salt, your cells will start to shrink leading to the condition known as hypernatremia. 48 teaspoons of your favourite seasoning at once is enough to trigger this reaction, also leading to seizures, coma or even death. Stick your head underwater or simply hold your breath and it takes around 4 minutes without oxygen to cause severe brain injury and at 6 minutes, you could die. However, in extreme cases, some freedivers have been able to hold their breath fo over 20 minutes. Cherries can also deprive you of oxygen. Say what? If you ever swallow a cherry pit, you shouldn't worry too much, just don't bite into one. 1 or 2 ground cherry pits contains enough cyanide to take you down. And these cyanide ions inhibite the enzyme cytochrome coxidaze, causing your cells to be unable to use oxygen. Speaking of a lack of oxygen, it's at around 8000 meters above sea level that our bodies can no longer acclamatize to delemited oxigen this is known as the \"death zone\" in mountaineering simply

back to the haze today we're gonna be doing another edible review we are reviewing the moon megadose moon bars this flavor is the cosmic cappuccino and I can absolutely say let me just start out with this I love these chocolates this is a California based brand I believe they do also fruit snax little bites other different types of products but I think they only do edibles I looked up and these guys are made with cannabis extract and you can definitely tell because these are strong the flavor is absolutely on point you don't taste any type of cannabis no oil not at all like it's kind of insane how much you don't taste it on these I would eat these even if there was no cannabis in it obviously like these are so far away I love them the packaging is also really cute I love a little moon right here it's really awesome I love the whole space theme of their company if you look in the front it also shows how many milligrams of THC is in every piece which is really nice my only complaint which is not really a complaint it's just like an inconvenience factor is that it comes with the top that you can't pull off like you have to get scissors to cut it it's impossible to get off any other way I mean maybe if you had a knife but I don't want to cut myself every little piece is 10 milligrams and I'm saying if you don't take edibles a lot I would just start out with that and you'll will feel it it is so nice in the back it says that it takes 45 minutes for it to hit and you definitely can plan on that because it does take 45 minutes for day it doesn't hit me and he's sooner it doesn't hit me any later like I honestly timed it out and it was really really accurate and I think that's really nice in the back you tell you the nutrition if that's important to you it's chocolate so I love that these guys are also extremely affordable I found them between $14 to $17 before tax there are not many edibles out there that you can say are delicious strong and affordable and the moon bars are all three and it's absolutely fantastic if you see these guys at your local dispensary I would say grab them I don't know if they're nationwide but I've seen them in Northern California and Southern California yeah I would say ground Diaz I absolutely recommend them so again guys these are the Moon Omega dose bars and I absolutely love them thank you guys so much for watching my video I hope you have a great day please leave a comment please hit that like button please hit that subscribe button I would also love to hear your guys's opinion on our Instagram so if

sense of your dispensary today I'm out here at the beautiful beautiful dog beach in Southern California and we're talking Korova again today viewer favorite kirova we're looking at their three dose hundred and fifty milligrams chokolate chip fan favorites and one of my personal favorites outside of their 500 milligram salted caramel brownie check out that video to see what a disgusting product tastes like but outside of that Club has been generally really really good to me so I'm excited here to give their three dose 150 milligrams chocolate chip cookie at running I tried the product to finish it up and come back in two hours let you know how we're feeling because that's the most important part alright so let's try to hope about this bad boy give it a taste if you'll excuse me for just a second here trying to do this with the gimbal so it's on the lock all right I think I finally gotten into open technical difficulties difficulties and there we go this is the core of a

tastes so you guys in two hours [Music] Korova three-dose medical Gambas chocolate-chip cookie and I am pleased to report that the Korova is three dose three dose 150 milligrams line is flawless another winner here with the chocolate chip cookie they take perfection which is the perfect cookie the chocolate chip cookie and perfected even better with the ability to make you high so I had nothing but pleasant things to say about the Korova three-dose chocolate chip cookie tastes great it'll get you [ __ ] up for an affordable price this cost me $7 at my dispensary which is just a great deal and even for a hundred and fifty milligram edible which is not that high on the grand scheme of things it still packs a pretty good punch even for somebody as seasoned as me so if you see the chocolate chip cookie or any of the other three dose blinds at crow at a the dispensary nearest you pick any of them up you're not going to be disappointed the chocolate chip cookie is among my favorites so yeah wholeheartedly recommend the Kariba chocolate chip cookie thank you so much for watching guys we'll check you on the next review hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you

looking both places you do taste the cannabis in this it's not really like strong overwhelming where it's like gross like a cushy punch cuz she put just tastes disgusting this doesn't taste nice like a cushy punch but it does have cannabis flavor in there along with the apricot and it tastes pretty good just one just want to let you guys know that and they're really soft and it's not like the tip

Master\nBlaster we're back at Johnny's green extractions and today we're in the\nkitchen we're gonna make gummy bears today and we're gonna infuse them with\nshatter we're gonna make 100 gummy bears here we're gonna use half a box of\njell-o two packs of gelatin maybe a tablespoon or two of our vegetable\nglycerin and we're gonna use our shatter here there's seven grams in here this\nshatter has to be decarboxylated which means it has to be heated to change the\nform of it from a THC a to THC so that you can get a medical effect from it and\nwith that being seven grams that will break down into point forty five\nmilligrams of shatter in each one of these gummy bears so they're going to be\nquite strong because they are for our own personal use and basically a medical\nused to help you sleep etc I just want to stress the point here that these are\ngummy bears and if you do happen to make something like this it is so important\nthat if there are children around whether it's grandkids your kids nieces\nnephews friends that have kids any kids that come over you can't just hide this\nstuff you actually have to lock this away because if a kid did get into it\nand they do seem to find things they will be hospitalized so everybody keep\nthat in mind and that's with all all edibles that you make that are THC\ninfused okay so our first step here is we're gonna decarboxylate this shatter\nwe're gonna put it in the oven at 200 and\n50 Fahrenheit for half an hour all right that's our first step here all right everybody we decarboxylated\nour shatter we melted our jell-o mixture it's warm remember everything's in low\nheat now we're just going to melt our shatter right into our liquid here slide\nit over to the heat pretty sticky   okay go we're gonna mix that in here now ok we got our hot liquid here we\nadded a teaspoon and a quarter of food glycerin just to disperse the shatter\nin here now this is a little tricky to do so we've got to move quick here here\nwe go and

today i'm going to be going over the math on how to actually figure out how much thc how much thc or cbd is in your oil how potent it is um a lot of questions i know in the last video i posted honest let me be real with you guys really quickly i posted that video thinking maybe if i got lucky like 15 people would see it so it wasn't my best work just gonna put out there it was my best work a lot of you guys have not seen the video i got a lot of comments on it a lot of questions all the concerns mostly great comments so thank you guys for keeping it positive i appreciate that let me preface this by saying i'm not an expert i don't know all the answers i'm just a girl making cannabis oil in our kitchen just like a lot of you guys i do know a little bit of math on how to figure that out i know in the last video i said i was going to give you the math and i kind of tried to in the comments but you know it's easier to just see it done so that's what we're going to do today we're going to visually walk through this when i have my levo machine now levo corrected me that's how you pronounce it levo my level machine is sitting here i made a new batch of oil so we're going to be doing the math on this particular batch what i have in here essentially is a cup of coconut oil i infused five grams of cannabis into this oil it's very concentrated very dark in color i don't know the exact percentage of the flour i was using so i'm gonna just ballpark it in like the 15 range just because that's pretty average for cannabis so let's say it's 15 it's always good to also overshoot it a little bit especially if you're dealing with thc just so you don't really overdo that and then obviously you can trial and error the amount of milligrams on your own personal body to see where you're at before we continue to go make sure you subscribe to my channel thank you for liking this video and watching well thank you for liking it if you like it please like it thanks for watching and keep watching if you want to know how to decode and figure out how much thc or cbd you're actually consuming when you make your own oil let's freaking go y'all okay everybody so what i have here is my piece of paper a pen and then my phone over here is my calculator and let's just freaking go into this thing oh and hello let's just like take a moment and just look at the beauty look at her oh look at her so to start things out i'm gonna write down the amount of oil that i used so up here i'm gonna write one cup um of oil the amount of cannabis that i use which was five grams grams of cannabis canna and those are the two numbers i'm going to start with if you'd like to convert your grams to milligrams one gram equals a thousand milligrams you can write that on the side one gram equals one thousand milligrams that's just for further conversion um and if you want to find out like per tablespoon you can also convert that i don't know off the top of my head so i'm just going to keep going so from here i have my one cup of oil and my five grams of cannabis oh and i know that this is 15 let's say it's thc for the fun of it 15 thc if you're using a hemp flour you do the 15 or 20 or whatever percent of that in cbd is those are the numbers you need to start with those three numbers right there you have three numbers your amount of oil you're infusing the amount of cannabis that you're using in the percent of whether it's thc or cbd they're using into that oil to do that i multiply my five grams of cannabis times my .15 so because if you convert you move the percentage over two decimals and that converts it to the percent or to the decimal rather and that would equal because i can't do math five times point one five equals point seven five so zero point 0.75 grams of this whole 5 grams is actually my thc that's present in my cannabis so from here in my whole cup one cup of oil i'm now once i'm done infusing going to have 0.75 grams of thc so .75 grams of thc into my oil i want to convert this grams into milligrams so in order to do that i just cross multiply so i have my one gram at top per 1000 milligrams i cross multiply you get rid of the grams and so per one cup of oil i actually have and then i multiply these 0.75 times 1 000 i have 750 milligrams of thc so in this entire little guy right here because it's a full cup there is 750 milligrams of thc in here okay so if i want to know let's see i'm using this for baking per tablespoon let's say now i would just convert this into tablespoons so let me look up really quickly what how many tablespoons are a cup cup two tablespoon so there's one cup so let's write it up here in our conversions one cup equals 16 tablespoons so that's another conversion you should know one cup of oil equals 16 tablespoons i can again cross multiply cups to cups and then there's 750 milligrams of thc per i mean this was a long way around just like honestly just switching out the numbers but just so you guys are more visual with it 750 per 16 tablespoons and then i want to find out how much per one tablespoon one tablespoon at the top and we don't know this answer we don't know this answer that's what we're trying to figure out and then you have 750 milligrams per 16 tablespoons pretty much you want to make sure these are always on opposite opposite sides of the line so that when you cross multiply you can actually just um cross it out and that what's that's how you get your numbers i don't know i took math a long time ago this is just what makes the most sense to me hopefully i'm explaining it in a way that makes sense to y'all uh unfortunately i don't know if i am 750 oop 750 why can't i do this pretty much all you need to do is take 750 and divide it by 16 and that'll give you how much thc per one tablespoon so we're trying to figure out this number right here so 750 oh my god divided by 16. so there's actually 46 milligrams of thc in a tablespoon you can also further convert this and you know figure out if you're using a cup in like let's say your entire cup in a recipe and it makes eight slices then you can really go in deep and figure out how much cbd thc whatever is in your slice but other than that that's really the math um screenshot this i hope it makes sense to you guys i mean i made a video about it so again it's just a lot of cross multiplying a little bit of conversions with this up here and then really it's just this percent of whatever you're find trying to find th c cbd whatever it may be and making sure you just take that into account in your total amount of cannabis cool y'all and that's it i hope that that was really helpful if it wasn't if i confused you more i sincerely apologize i am not a mathematician i took math a long time ago i'm just trying to use what i learned in essentially middle school and applying it here but hopefully that explains things a little bit more if you like this video again please make sure to give it a thumbs up a like um if you didn't like this video whatever not sorry about it it is what it is you know i'm just trying to hear live life and make my freaking cannabis oily people so if you would like me to make something with this cannabis oil let me know in the comments below what you think i should make with it i tend to like to bake healthier things like paleo cakes and dairy free items and gluten free items that's kind of the stuff that i personally eat if you don't eat that stuff that's no big deal i literally do not care but also just let me know in the comments what you want me to make with this stuff because i'm planning on making oh actually i know exactly my sister's birthday is coming up if you're watching this in the very very very future it's already happened but maybe i'm gonna make her a birthday cake with it hope you guys enjoyed also levo thank you so much for providing me with this item if you guys haven't got yours all ready i'm obsessed with it i love using it it does make your place smell a little bit like cannabis but honestly in my opinion not as bad as like doing it in the stove top or in your own oven and it's freaking easy cleanup i just love how easy it is you can download an app you can control all the temperatures from your phone it's literally the best so if you're going to make the investment i highly suggest doing so if you want to buy one for yourself i'm going to link them down below so you can go purchase one i do not have a discount code just yet levo if you see this if you are watching i would love a discount code to give to my people so if that does happen and you're watching this again in the future i will update with the discount code below cool great y'all hope you all have a great day bye [Music] you", "-OOByL1Prfs": "it was a best rookie I'm going to take paper over 5150 tendo's to the face I have to say these are my favorite I haven't tried the black bar yet which is supposedly a thousand milligrams of THC this is 500,000 milligrams to see kana seems excessive that's a lot that's a lot okay the neck this video but hey now I recommend a stimulant of some kind I have a Vietnamese coffee now whenever you're gonna the reason I like kirova is because they balance out their their THC with CBD so while you're gonna get 500 milligrams achieve see you're gonna also get six milligrams of CBD now if you didn't have the CB the six milligrams of CBD the majority of you would lose your [ __ ] if you didn't pass out from the high amount of THC majority of you might have an anxiety attack or a panic attack like you guys seen the YouTube video when I when the cop calls and he calls 9-1-1 he's a cop and he's under - Brown is about freaking out that's because he didn't have the CBD to balance out that THC it's kind of like God's little safety net if you will a lot of people think that Grover edibles have a canvas taste I don't really like them they don't like the taste that's stupid look why if you just go to Safeway Safeway just go to any supermarket go get a thing of fresh baked brownies if you don't want to taste I mean come on it's ridiculous tastes like just regular non edibles there's gonna be some work you didn't watch meet you definitely if you're not lactose intolerant definitely want to take this with some milk well well I can't say I don't move you can see the oil reserves are definitely not dry I probably shouldn't eat before ingesting this we goes at three minutes all right and apparently kirova is on Facebook I've liked him there on Facebook oh drop son dogs gonna get that and it says right here on the back you can always eat more but you can't always eat less so remember that 5150 now the 5150 goes for anywhere from eighteen to twenty-two dollars depending on where you get it I got a diversity Ritter River City Phoenix so it was twenty dollars typically that's the average price for a 5150 bar now the first time I had a 5150 bar I split it with my roommate and she she freaked out she did not she didn't make it we split one of these down the middle and she did not make it in fact I even had a little bit more than she did she did not make it I recommend that you not eat these on an empty stomach especially first timers if you've eaten edibles you eat edibles all the time working you're full of [ __ ] blah blah blah then yeah neck this was nothing in your stomach and you're gonna be like that scene from the Titanic with the girl and then Leonardo DiCaprio is holding her empty stomach but if you do not have the intestinal fortitude the testicular fortitude I wouldn't recommend it damn I really hate this not directly after eating there but what are you gonna do other edibles that I've tried that I do like various gummies goomy's the gloomies I have one the other day from the green door I think that's the name the green door collective I'm not sure but I got a gummy booming it was a 100 or 150 was like 12 bucks I ate it that's what you do but I have to say with the gummies the effect is fast the effect is much faster than you would you would typically see from a cookie edible for sure those of you that might be asking later yes that's a 420 alarm clock Ben hmm I'm beginning to feel its effects for those of you that have eaten edibles at some point and get this weird life it's almost like that pre psychedelic when you when you take the psychedelic right before it's affected kick in you get that feeling of like you know when you're in a rollercoaster you guys scratching in school and the thing starts that's what I'm experiencing right now we're getting ready to go please leave me comments down in the comment section below if you liked my review of grow the edibles and we're gonna start doing these every other day if not at least once a week you're gonna mow branch out into maybe dispensary reviews in the California area in Northern California area see how those right now this is a chore for me to eat because I just ate dinner it's so stupid of me I should have like not even dinner came home snack this and then eat dinner because this is like a it's it's its effort to take this down it really shouldn't be it's moist soft it's just me it's not you kirova it's me I recently just going to watch and eat this yeah you are definitely definitely starting to feel the effects which is weird cuz it's been 9 minutes but right there I definitely got a my body telling me hey whoa what was that excuse me it's your body here something going on strange don't know what it is Christopher Walken is horrible it needs work out we'll work on it anyway this video is getting long in the tooth throw edibles the 5150 if you can handle it if you can take it maybe you can take try and in the comments down below let me know your experience all right guys it's WYD wookie signing out", "91AXCd5Fcx0": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheat the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and today we are taking a look enough from another product from just dab bytes we are taking a look at their special nug Run breakfast bar in this fancy fancy gold iridescent packaging you can see their shimmery shines right back in the camera again super fancy packaging it's another hundred and twenty milligram byte here I believe it is a breakfast bar so I think it's probably like the rice krispies treat I mean I guess ingredients cereal marshmallow butter vanilla extract crafted in a kitchen that also prepares nuts eggs and wheat so be careful there on the back it's got all the fancy government warnings of the infused with flowers from pristine indoor gardens free from harmful contaminants carefully cultivated with organic nutrients and no synthetic pesticides pure THC oil from nug Run whole bud extractions certified solvent free ooh la fancy schmancy but guys it's not about how fancy schmancy the packaging is or how good the marketing is it's first about how it tastes and secondly most importantly it's about how it makes you feel so guys the way our reviews work in that vein is I'm going to eat this packed or this guy up and then we're going to come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm actually feeling because that is the most important part of the Etta Bourdieu process so we've got our second level of packaging here looks more like than just at packaging I recognize a standard issue like aluminum foil packaging there ah so here we go here is our breakfast bar it is a rice krispie pebbles breakfast bar smells like fruity pebbles and a little bit of weed let's give it a taste in terms of the Rice Krispies bars I've had this is on the better end yeah it's good um no real discernible weed taste to just speak up qe not still at all flavorful with the rice krispies there excuse me the fruity pebbles I like it but well I'm not sure is how it's gonna make me feel just ABS been a little bit all over the place in the past I think I've reviewed two or three of their products and found them to be sort of up and down so I'm excited to see how this one's gonna do two hours from now for you guys it's just gonna be a couple of seconds I'll see you on the other side of the break peace [Music] welcome back two weeks guys it's been two hours since I had the 120 milligram just dab bites nug run special breakfast bar and um it's not worthy of its packaging it's okay I'm a little high wish it were higher for 120 milligram an\u00edbal it tasted pretty good I'm sort of on the lower end of what I would expect for 120 milligrams at a bowl unfortunately um yeah low to average you know I'm definitely slightly high not as much as I would have liked not as much as the packaged packaging would indicate because look at this bad boy I definitely am NOT flying first class I would say I'm in coach maybe maybe flying the luggage compartment below so yeah a little disappointing the just a bites special nug run breakfast bar that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats it was a little bit disappointing today but hopefully the next one will be a little bit more positive thank you so much for watching guys and we will see on the next review peace hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in

about half an hour so I kind of felt giggly and stuff and I was like great this is working this is working it feels like the first time I smoked some giggly I'm like a schoolgirl this thing is working and now not so much I kinda feel a little bit right here probably because I have an extremely high tolerance but you never know with these things as vice showed in a documentary they're always low barred with the THC content the milligrams but you never know I heard a lot of good things from a lot of people maybe I should have made two of them but until next time guys I'm Rick Shaw peace",

them dinky cars hey do they call that do they call them that anymore well I don't know that's what they used to be called Hot Wheels well anyway we found this one here at the Walmart for a buck and a

that my camera's been stoned as [ __ ] lately hey so it gets blurry once in a while so yeah anyway back to the review video here back to what she's doing let me open up these Jalapa no M&Ms I can only smell chocolate in the bag you think that you can smell some of the Jalapa no but you can't probably noticing anything you struggling what's a pop come on they want to see you eat the whole thing to know that you got it into you okay don't taste like it the overall even if it didn't have THC in it and somebody gave you this oh it's doing shivers up my spine all know when you're all high as [ __ ] later you'll be happier these taste like regular peanut M&Ms except for they leave a little bit of a spicy taste in your throat but they're not too bad you probably use a little bit more Jalapa no yeah I'm not if there's any vegans that watch you whatever but definitely not for me you big uns must have a teeth a tasty [ __ ] nothing [ __ ] it all up I [ __ ] up what I was gonna say I was gonna say you vegans must have [ __ ] up tastebuds according to Donna oh I don't know I don't eat vegan food it looks a little [ __ ] I mean it looks okay but then you can't win it looks like it's made out of [ __ ] that you know stuff that'll make you [ __ ] hey we're still smoking the dirty old timid Street weed I had to buy a teeny bit more today tomorrow we're gonna do a review video of either tuna cush or night nurse that's night nurse not night nurse we got a box here from buy my weed online that's Charlie growling if anybody's wondering if we got a box here from buy my weed online no we're not going to open it today we're gonna open it tomorrow morning when they get up and we're gonna do it unboxing of this and at the same time we're gonna do a wake and bake and we're gonna do a review

something else and be able to give a [ __ ] a good review you know an honest opinion of how good that strain is you got a [ __ ] you know you're done yeah so yeah once again those 40 milligrams I hope you guys can see it if not [ __ ] go back to the beginning and [ __ ] read it again 40 milligrams of THC [ __ ] we're gonna wait for Donna to get all loopy and we'll be back but first I'm gonna do this bomb talk here because I need to do a [ __ ] bomb toke was there anything you season news today that I don't know because well you can take a quick look if there is there is if there's not does not it's been kind of quiet for like the last three days because I cannot watch yeah I can't do boy that's it's hard to watch Haley and surf the Internet at the same time she's quick she's all over the place you got to stay with her that's the name no rocks missing I didn't see nothing earlier either anyway I'm gonna fill my bowl back up we're gonna wait for Donna to get all loopy and we'll come back with her review of the blue jay bar my review so far on the taste don't don't buy it because you think it's good cuz it's oh she says don't buy it because of the taste like if you thinking but that's only because she doesn't like the vegan stuff if you're vegan that might be for you you go over to can abismo and get yourself a couple you know I think I showed you guys the back egg all you vegans out there might want to see the that this and that's there I don't know if it's gonna come in though hang on give me a second give me a second here there so pause your screen and you can read all the health [ __ ] on there or whatever your nutrition facts and yeah and yeah pause your screen and read that and maybe it's for you hey we should also note that when Donna eats these edibles here she usually gets the really tasty flavored waters like chocolate flavored and vanilla flavored and mint flavored so to get this vegan one here is gonna be quite the difference in taste so keep that mind just saying anyway I'm going to fill up my balls we're going to wait for that ship to kick in and we'll be back with Donna's review or opinion or whatever you got whatever you want to call it you feel it yet a little bit Donna might look a little different because she took a shower well you're wearing different clothes a few seconds ago in our body it sound like I was playing in the mud that didn't make it sound like you're playing in the mud but okay if that's the way you feel are you feeling the did you answer yes and would you say cuz I didn't hear it a little bit she's feeling it a little bit you guys might have noticed an echo in here it's getting worse and worse for the last couple weeks that's because a few months back well maybe almost a year ago Timmins housing sent me a letter saying they were gonna well they offered me some different places how'd that work they gave me a list of [ __ ] places I had to pick three of them that I would like to move to if I was to move because the place I'm in now this place here has too many bedrooms and I don't need that many bedrooms so then we're going to give me another place and throughout the last year or so we've been slowly putting things in the boxes and that's why you notice some stuff here is like bare like some of the stuff that used to be here is not here anymore and my bookshelf that used to be here is gone and my books and all that and some pictures and whatever anyway whatever who cares anyway a lot of my stuff's in boxes right now cuz apparently I'm supposed to got a new place to live in but I don't know what the [ __ ] that's gonna happen if anybody gives a [ __ ] but that's what the echos from would you eat one of these Donna's eating one of these Jalapa no peanut M&Ms it says Mexican Jew Mexican Jalapa dole if that it was any different than normal July but you know like that you're just the worse so it's not fully kicked in yet though it's 40 milligrams you're used to taking 30 did you feel 40 also I wanted to mention over on my Twitter there's a billion different marijuana dispensaries sending me messages asking me about their [ __ ] this and that whatever and I'll get tired of telling everybody if you want me to review your product my [ __ ] address is in the description below send it to me I'll make a video review your product and tell you what I [ __ ] think it's easy stuff a trained dog can do it hey so yeah stop sending me stupid messages and just [ __ ] send me your product then I'll [ __ ] smoke it and tell you what I think and I think that's all I have to say now we're waiting for your review of the [ __ ] vegan bar vegan Bluejays thingamabob the taste is we already heard that you didn't like the taste maybe people are skipping through that part now whatever okay I'm gonna do a bomb dope glad Donna oh forgot my ball earlier oh well okay so oh yeah just it tastes horrible and even when you're done it and it's been a long time the taste is still I don't even want to know what the taste what tasted okay although than the taste everything's going okay everything's going the plan hey Donna yeah I just can't get rid of the taste and it's not like HC taste or yeah I can help you get rid of the taste miss Vicki - laughs little chips don't get rid of the vegan taste in your mouth carpet what the [ __ ] is Hardy carpet not so much you'll enjoy the weekend I will or they will I will why cuz it's supposed to be oh I thought you were saying everybody was gonna enjoy the weekend I was trying to figure out how anyway as I was saying earlier the Edible that she's eaten today it comes from can abismo that's Charlie snoring under the table if you guys are wondering they move this over to the board fucksakes can abismo dot CA you can go there to get yourself some edibles some really good weeds some shades and also uh clothes and hats and all kinds of [ __ ] mostly stuff to get nice and [ __ ] up with a you get nice and stoned if you go there and buy your stuff there they got really good weeds and I thought the batmobile hanging up there now as you guys could see I don't know why I hung it up for I probably should just throw it in the [ __ ] box a pack and stuff up anyways [ __ ] but you gotta remember this is Timmins hosing it's already been a year since they said they were gonna give me another place so I'm gonna be here another year just living my stuff in boxes who knows at least nobody will be able to steal my stuff all my good stuff would be buried and I put all the heavy boxes on top so nobody wants to steal books hey nobody wants to learn any more so my books would be safe we got some chocolate chip cookies from the Walmart they're pretty good but they're kind of tough yes I was baked in store mm-hmm baked in storm that somebody leave them out on the counter overnight these aren't like soft you know what I mean the air got to them somebody forgot about the cookies it's Walmart it probably wasn't really baked in the store it was probably baked into us in it he was probably baked in store somewhere [ __ ] else and then shipped here well wherever that is they left them out too long hmm you don't enjoy cookies like that do ya no I don't home mm-hmm what you gonna eat it anyways well you're not supposed to waste anyways I'm gonna fill my ball back up but I'm getting the munchies I'm gonna make a [ __ ] uh a ham and cheese sandwich and for both yeah I was kind of hoping you were gonna make mine and then you could make one for both how about that anyway I'm gonna fill this up and maybe maybe that'll kick in a little harder and we'll see what happens mm hmm what you don't break a tooth on your hard cookie Donna made me a ham and cheese sandwich and if it wasn't for the mustard I don't think I'd be able to get it down why you so cheap with the cheese and [ __ ] ham I put two slices that's very that is thin meat it's so thin you can almost see through it you put two slices like a still with two slices together I could still [ __ ] see through it and the cheese doesn't even cover all the bread yeah but then you'd have overlapping I like it overlapping so much bread here she's got leftover taco salad if anybody's wondering what the hell are you laughing at the animals kicking in look you have mustard seed yeah I got a mustard sandwich that's what seems like the taco salad that she's eating she

of your dispensary classic ass episode today which of course means edible uh an edible brand we've looked at many many times one of my favorites it's been a bit of a rough week here at wheat's hq in the world at large um southern california is burning the sky is orange outside of me i felt like i really wanted that edible that i was sure was gonna do the trick so what did i go with today an old favorite an old classic let's take a look at good old kiva again that's right one of my all-time favorites kiva manufacturers of the wonderful chocolate bars the little terabytes and even some excellent gummies uh not too too long ago they've branched out got some new fancy flavors out there including one of my favorite flavors period good old mint chocolate chip um it's a love it or hate it flavor i'm a love it kind of guy and i thought you know the world's burning let's do some kiva so uh this is as i said a kiva chocolate bar of 100 milligrams of a thc uh mint chocolate chip flavored picked it up for a uh respectable 21 at my dispensary which is more than average for the edible there for sure uh not too much higher than their chocolate edibles definitely higher than the gummies uh but kiva is a product uh of exceedingly high caliber so uh it is usually worth that slight premium uh so let's go ahead and get this 21 chocolate bar open we've got some very elaborate directions on how to open it here cuba seems to have quite the process uh so let's figure this out uh one press on flat surface tabs to unlock cool two well this is a flat surface two use finger to slide out three pull open oh that does not feel like that is uh [ __ ] it too stupid oh wait maybe i just have to take the sticker off didn't it say to take the sticker off but you know oh god damn it do i hate all these pieces of packaging ah there we go just rip it they make so much great child proof packaging but what they don't realize is when you make childproof packaging you also make idiot-proof packaging and while i am not a child i am definitely an idiot and i don't like being treated like a child but i don't mind being treated like an idiot um yeah how do you get something that's child proof packaging that's hard difficult to open for children but still oh my god remarkably open you know not difficult jesus christ wow that was a hell of a lot of effort i don't understand how that was even supposed to work it was glued at the very bottom like to the package oh well take that into account when purchasing this uh don't take this somewhere you need to open it discreetly uh boy okay so here we go here is our kiva th c 100 milligrams infused chocolate bar uh nice and green like mint chocolate chip so uh if i'm correct it's gonna be five 20 milligram little pieces in this bar yes yes yes oh wow there's some like real minty chunks on the back there so this is what our bar looks like or at least half of it the other half's broken in there uh five milligrams each of those little rectangles for 20 in total for 100 milligrams and all and like all our wheats reviews we're gonna review the entire product not just the taste i'm gonna eat all hundred milligrams of this probably gonna take me about an hour to do so it's a lot of chocolate looking forward to it and then two hours after i have that last bite i'll come right back here to you guys and let you know if this kiva is as good as it's always been but first things first let's give it a try um little known fact but the k and kiva stands for quality because this is some quality chocolate wow nice dark oh man i'm a dark chocolate fan which is weird because i don't really like bitter things but dark chocolate is excellent and kevin makes an excellent dark chocolate bar that has virtually zero weed taste mostly just great dark chocolate nice peppermint aftertaste mmm hmm manquila is one of those um rare rare rare rare edibles that the fact that i've only eaten like a quarter of this at this point is actually like oh well that sucks i'm almost out of chocolate because it's just good to eat chocolate like i've said this before about cuba i would have eaten this for pleasure if the with that at the exact way it tasted right now even if there were it was not going to get me high i wouldn't pay 21 dollars for it but it is just good quality chocolate and a good quality high i hope but to find out for sure i'm gonna have to wait a bit until these uh effects come on i've got some more chocolate to eat and uh i am very excited to see how this is gonna go it's already brightening my day up in these apocalyptic wildfires so uh to some degree already mission accomplished but i'm really really excited to see what comes next i hope you guys are too i'll be right back here to hang out with you in just a bit to give you our wrap-up thoughts see you then [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it has been about four hours actually since my first check-in with kiva's mint

chocolate chip bar i suspected it was gonna be good i'm happy to say they're still great they still make quality products wow um this is a really nice four hour high as i said high enough that i

different than just smoking if you are eating edibles I do not recommend your ass driving or doing anything I'm a pretty experienced user when it comes to this and you know I can smoke weed and skateboard all day and be fine but I'm not getting anywhere I wouldn't even try to [ __ ] steer a shopping cart right now to be perfectly honest with you which is another good reason that you know if you're gonna do animals on the on being serious be smart about it do it at home don't go out and do something stupid walk into traffic or some [ __ ] like that gun is I need all the readers I can get good afternoon and welcome to part three of the animals I'm gonna try to get through this without making a complete ass out of myself so this should be interesting because yeah by now they have

dispensary if you look around we're in beautiful Huntington Beach right now actually I think we're in Bolsa Chica we're at the bowls of chicken nature preserve in Huntington Beach utterly beautiful you can look at the the bay here this is an actual wildlife preserve so a lot of cool creatures running around being protected out here which is wonderful but we're not here to talk about critters and creatures as much as I like critters and creatures we're actually here to talk about liquid gold and their chocolate crisp papar 210 milligrams of THC so from the fine folks at chi Pharma labs they also make the G drinks which I've reviewed quite a few of the section my second or third liquid gold review I can't remember the exact number I think it's maybe the third I've liked them quite a bit in the past the chocolates pretty good and it's gotten me quite high in the past so I've got high expectations for the chocolate crisp of the bar from liquid gold again 210 milligrams of THC in that package let's go ahead and open it up here and give it a taste let you know how it tastes and then of course guys as always I will come back to you in two hours to let you know it's actually feeling that's the most important part of the edible review process so just a moment here let's open this bad boy up if I could figure out how to open packages do you think you know 150 or so of these in by now I wouldn't know how to do this but I still mess up okay just one of them broke off in the bottom eat right now so you can see we've got six of these right here these liquid gold bar pieces you see we got six of them looks like a Nestle Crunch bar okay so there is a slight cannabis taste to it nothing terrible chocolate is still good but there is a noticeable Canada miss taste to it again nothing overwhelming it's not gonna kill you you're gonna finish it just buy it but you're super super averse to any cannabis taste just know that going down but otherwise chocolates good like the crunch like it all the only thing I'm not sure about guys is whether or not it's gonna get me high for that you're gonna have to wait two hours or excuse me just a couple of seconds for you guys I'll have to wait two hours to find out for sure and I'll let you be sure to let you guys know thanks for watching wheats and I'll see you soon peace I am back from the wilderness of Orange County California to the safe safe confines of the urban metropolis of Los Angeles California where Los Angeles County California so back out of the jungle of the dangers of owed the OSI and back to LA welcome back to wheat skies it has been two hours since I had the liquid gold 210 milligram chocolate crisp bar and I can a lot I'm in a solid six six or seven somewhere in that range right now feeling it pretty well liking the high nice mellow relaxed feeling high not not zonked out by any stretch of the imagination but feeling relaxed so utterly enjoying it tasted good there as it said there is a cannabis taste to it but the chocolate is high-quality that cannabis taste is because it is pretty potent this is this is this is good stuff in here yeah I'm pleased with the liquid gold bar if you guys see the oh and this is made from cannabis oil which I forgot to mention there at the bottom they proudly display it so it is not from just straight flower it is made nothing a lot of stuff is made from flour anymore I think cannabis oil is becoming the way that edibles are mostly produced now especially in mass quantities but I don't have any evidence just anecdotally what I've seen around as you can tell I'm high I'm rambling oh and these normally retail for around you know like 18 bucks somewhere in that range I got it for 1250 a to 425 special which is a really good deal really good value absolutely great value at that price totally suggested totally recommended if you see at that price and not a bad deal at eighteen dollars if you see at that price I so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on a later review peace", "UozGXNcA-jA": "[Music] the presence of chocolate in the vial can interfere

that way right I had one of those nights recently where I came home and I was drunk but I was like I'm gonna have a nightcap because you know it's never enough and I go into my fridge right and then I reach in the back and I go to reach for a beer but instead I found a pot edible in my fridge here's the thing about this edible a normal marijuana edible could be anywhere from like five milligrams like a hundred it's like a lot it's like on the high end right this was a 1000 milligram edible not like they used to be legal in California and I bought one out there took a bite of a corner and then just saw God for six weeks I was like I'm all the days are gonna take the rest of my life to eat this but then again now I'm drunk and I'm like ah the thousand milligrams I can fight off the effects of this this is I'm drunk you know so I bit into it and I was like oh this is actually kind of delicious because it was a brownie and then I just ate the rest of it yeah I went to bed at like 2:00 in

the bathroom but I didn't walk there I just floated there like a cartoon character who's multiply you know I mean just [ __ ] nose-first [Laughter] and I get to the bathroom and here's like the

we're gay we got defense mechanisms working here some like splashing water in my face let me come away come away c'mon he's like okay because you know we've been burned before so he had to be sure

to bring you another strain review but i want you i want to present you some edibles and today we're gonna take a look at some really nice sugar cubes i've recently gotten my hands on as you can see here is the visual appearance they are like little sugar squares that come they come in two colors and they taste different but the thc content is the same with both i know that they are made using concentrates and i have to say they really hit you but first let's talk about the taste and the taste is really nice with those edibles because um you really have that nice cannabis flavor in there but it's also very sweet and i've eaten some truly disgusting cannabis brownies but this this stuff you can just you um you don't swallow it you suck on it for some time i don't think that's the right word but i don't really care so after it has dissolved in your mouth it will take about one to two hours to kick in and you will have a really nice high for about four to five hours i have to say it really lasts quite some time the dosage is like for me i'm a pretty regular cannabis consumer if i really want to get [ __ ] up i take two off but for like everyday life one is really sufficient and it will get you nice and high of course you can also take more than two but um i had a friend who took four one time and he told me that the experience really reminded him of magic mushrooms so i would maybe um eat those brownies um like in smaller dosages if you don't want to get completely [ __ ] up the high itself is very like it's a very indica heavy high because edibles they mostly they hit you for a long time they hit you hard and you're not gonna be very productive but on the other hand i somehow found that these edibles make me enormously good at cs go i'm showing some gameplay in the background now and this gameplay was all recorded while i was high of those sugar cubes and i really got some amazing frags around there i don't usually am so i'm not usually that good at cs go so in the end if you can get yourself on some sugar cube edibles i would really recommend you to try them out of course they are very rare but if you can get your hands on them they are absolutely worth it i hope you enjoyed the video consider to like and subscribe maybe leave a comment and i will see you in the next one", "zaml88FpweU": "all right what is up everybody Jacobs back with another video

from the not from like directly from a dispensary but from a friend of mine so yeah there's a pretty good price I think if you were to go to like a dispensary or something they usually charge $10 per hundred milligrams so kind of a good deal but yeah I'll show you these guys again know if you can see right down there 500 milligrams yeah 500 huh so yeah let's dig in so that's pretty cool just like I don't know little sour patch kids they don't look quite the same the sugar is kind of weird it looks wet and another thing it says on the back here five servings per container serving size one piece but there's like just way more than five pieces in that I don't know if you guys can see but we're taking doesn't taste like weed at all it's a lot better than that nerd rope I had that [ __ ] was like I don't think I like nerds I don't know but I did eat like a banana like I think an hour or 45 minutes ago just to sort of like activate my metabolite I don't know but oh yeah and something else I forgot like I figured like people would just figure did I do it that way but like I keep like I got a lot of comments on the last one I did like the nerd rope the nerd rope 400 milligram edible I think it was there were a lot of people that like just thought that video was like one video or like one time I think like I just got a bunch of like comments that were like you know edibles take longer than 10 minutes to hit and I was like well you really think I've like a weed Tube channel and I don't know the edibles don't hit immediately after you eat them so I mean I don't know I mean but just this isn't gonna be the whole video like I'm gonna check back in like an hour two hours whenever I start like really feeling high and that's gonna be me then later so alright cleared the whole bag we're out of these shits so I'm gonna check in and like last like an hour maybe two hours maybe three hours however long this takes to take effect yeah I'm gonna take one more head of this [Music] little baby hit but yeah I'll check back in with you guys about two hours or so so peace alright so check him back in guys it is now 2:30 so it's been about three or four hours and I am [ __ ] high I'm so high like I just feel like good and like cozy like I don't know in movies right now I'm on yes man with Jim Carrey shit's hilarious but yeah I just been chilling and I had two bowls of cereal but ya know how feelings [ __ ] good this is like holy [ __ ] this light that I have for the lighting like he's really [ __ ] bright yeah I would definitely recommend these who these things are [ __ ] dope they smacked me in the face cuz holy [ __ ] I'm I like him actually like I don't know I feel pretty good about him at least right now edible you know just kind of chill cuz yesterday I got like I drank so much like an I passed out I'm so tired and I threw up it was just like a horrible day so this just yeah it's a lot nicer everything like I don't know everything I look at like specifically focus on like looks very like clear and like clean but then everything else behind it is it like such an intense like a blur well yeah I'm just really chilling you know like this I like I said this is definitely a [ __ ] fire edible I [ __ ] with this i 100% recommend it but I'm other than that I have no idea what to talk about I kind of just want to know getting my [ __ ] back get in my bed and watch this movie so yeah I'll take one last rep I haven't been smoking too much we're hiding actually I had a couple reps of this like I think three hours in or so not too long ago he's dying but I did that because I was like kind of feeling the body high a little bit but I was just like nervous that it wasn't gonna be intense enough for whatever reason sometimes he sings some like a [ __ ] hit or miss but yeah so I smoked and then I like got really high and yeah I think I'm like getting maybe close to like the full effect I don't know how long this will last but I think usually the potent ones are the more potent the longer it lasts so maybe it's still building up but either way I'm just trying to chill out so I hope you guys are smoking I hope you guys enjoyed the video [ __ ] sour

coming review man see y'all soon", "aiEZcBQtL7w": "[Music] you're listening to the curious about Canada's podcast that's one of the big areas we assess with patience in fact we have a list of criteria on our website under the FAQ that it kind of guides patients through a questionnaire you know do you have a cardiac condition do you have cancer do you have diabetes you know is it for a child or adolescent do you want to individualize approach things like that where they should seek medical oversight of their Jonathas therapy and pharmaceutical interactions are probably the big one that could potentially cause harm and I know that is such an unpopular message but I've seen some close calls I've seen some near misses and I'm telling you in a perfect storm scenario somebody could get harmed and then the reputation of cannabis as a safe medication goes out the window right so we're trying to prevent that we're also trying to you know of course we want to protect patients as well you know I had an 80 something-year-old woman with chronic pain in Michigan and she went into a dispensary which she called the health clinic she thought she was doing medical advice and you know for chronic pain never used cannabis she was taking metoprolol which interacts with THC in a way that can cause somebody to think they're having a heart attack and they end up in the ER yeah this budtender sold for a 300 milligram THC candy bar but don't worry told her to only eat half oh my god was high for days and thank God she happened to space it away from her medications or that could have been a real problem so you know these and that's just you know a medication interaction but then you have other interactions with like chemo therapies or it's weird combined with CBD it can expedite liver failure yeah so I mean there's definitely reasons to seek medical oversight you know when when those conditions are are present you", "c9HaH1d5Mm4": "yo what's good YouTube actually I was wrong I want this one to be the grand finale video for this channel and the start to the new blind stoner channel a name-brand product the review yes you read the title right I managed to get a punch bar a couple of them and I'm going to review one and not not like the 90 milligram one's the original 225 milligram ones so what I hope that this will accomplish is to show that yes the decarboxylate err that I always rave about it works and it can give you an increased tolerance but also it's a name-brand product if you're a Californian you've you've been around dispensaries that have these things I'm sure you've tried punch bars you know how high they can get you or you know how high to under 25 milligrams is supposed to gate so without further ado let's try to like review this no I'm I'm gonna try this at every angle the flavor really doesn't matter it's just a potency it could be a [ __ ] you know they could do me like one of those jellybeans companies you know or they they try and find the most disgusting flavors all earwax toothpaste vomit carpet like [ __ ] as long as they suck out the TAC I'll eat it all right now bear with me as I open this up so yeah I'm gonna eat an entire one of these so this is the bar itself this is what it comes in squares and here you have it nine potent squares 25 milligrams each I'm not gonna learn it tastes a lot like no it's a god definitive weed taste to it but they kind of just put the wax in there see two bites I'm really done with this so yeah we'll see how high does get me and when I start reviewing you know when I do reviews for other wax and edibles you'll know that I'm not [ __ ] around when I say that I'm not alright time to wait two hours peace", "96y9vctDktw": "hey guys Rebecca from elements of eternity so today I am working with cannabis again I am making a edible medicine I'm making chocolate peanut butter truffles these are actually going to be dipped in homemade organic chocolate so I already D carved my marijuana and medicine and today I am using sunset sherbert this strain is actually known as galette oh it's a indica dominant hybrid 85% indicus of 15% sativa strain it's very potent it tested about 29% it's mom and dad is Girl Scout cookie and pink panties actually so I was wanting to make an extra strength medicine here I wanted them to be about a hundred milligrams apiece by the time I'm done with them now for starters they recommend around 10 milligrams and see how it goes so to make my butter I used a organic here's my gonna be the mix I know it's cream but it tastes just like the inside of a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup but I used an organic hormone-free churned butter cream like a butter and organic coconut oil is going to be for my chocolate and what I did was I usually it is about two ounces per pound of butters but I actually used three and I didn't use trim I actually use the buds I got this from the cultivation car farm the other day and I grind this up so I ground up the three ounces of this and to measure your THC when you're making edible guys it's always a rule of thumb that one gram of cannabis has a thousand milligrams of dry weight that means a strain house like say for instance 15 percent THC now this strain has 29 percent CHD their THC so it's higher but for instance the average medicine flower has 15 percent THC it'll have about a hundred and fifty milligrams of THC 15 percent of say a thousand milligrams equals 150 milligrams but sorry I got dizzy for a second but the average strain actually is only 10 percent anything over 15 or 20 percent in your strain is considered above average and high in THC and it's considered extremely potent and this strain here I'm using actually for edibles is really good with appetite stimulation it helps with pain restlessness and sleepiness the great thing about these is that it doesn't it does make you feel good and euphoric but it's not supposed to knock you out now if it does knock you out that means you took too much and since everybody handles edibles completely different it's highly recommended that if you're not used to edibles to start small like say for instance these are a hundred milligrams apiece to start out actually in a fourth now if you're you know used to this and all that you've got to eat the whole thing but yeah so what i'm doing here actually I need in my hands are sterile I need 50 of them if I have 50 of the these right here that's a hundred milligrams each now if I don't make it that far and get actually 50 of them then they're actually going to be more potent than that and I have my labels and ingredients in all that forum these are amazing alternative medicines for you know people that are really having a hard time with illness or cancer say nausea energy or whatever and I'm using the stainless steel ball is half of them because I want them all to be the same size and what I do is I dip them in powdered sugar so that they don't stick and kind of just pack it in there and knock off the excess so that and like I said they're going to be dipped in chocolate so they're going to be so they're going to be truffles chocolate peanut butter medicated truffles mm-hmm by the time I'm done with them and you know for people who are not familiar with edibles when they eat them they expect this high like you would smoking marijuana and it's actually nothing at the sort now you do get high and you do get intoxicated I'm not gonna lie about that but it's not the same you can be in a lot of pain and within a half an hour you'll start feeling your pain ease away or nausea or joint pain muscles it's great for arthritis hey guys I'm back along my camera father so I just did my chocolate oh and by the way I'm sorry my phone cut out I had to lower my resolution on my phone so I could finished the video so this half is going to be a little less better quality so I made my chocolate which is just organic coconut oil organic cocoa powder some honey and since it is summer months I want my product to hold up so I added a little bit of organic beeswax to the chocolates so that it holds up and I also crushed some Adeem a nuts which are kind of like a bean they kind of taste like a roasted peanut and I crushed them up it's gonna go on the tops and I set these in the freezer anything easier to to handle and for the chocolate to free zones or set up so we're going to do and let it drip off c6o and if you chop wits like this and you're wanting to add toppings you have to do it right from the get-go because once it cools um just like so so I'm gonna pause this and get more done and then I'll be back okay guys I'm back so I ended up getting them all done dipped in chocolate and they turned out really great I decided to only put the a dummy on some the Adame nuts and for packaging they actually go on one of these a little and they hardened up great so they go on one of these and in one of these boxes and plated with the ingredients and the sonim so yeah they turned out great I must say guys that I know they're at a hundred milligrams but I'll tell you what I test all my products so I um tooth like I don't know it was like a [ __ ] half a teaspoon of just the filling and let me tell you I'm I'm really feeling motion but I was really nauseous and hurtin and that's all gone a little loopy I honestly wouldn't drive that's for sure so yeah I'm really really happy with how they turned out and they turn nice and hard because I put the little bit of beeswax in it so yeah that's about it so I'll talk to you guys later bye", "Qx641bSyRgM": "[Music] [Music] yo what's poppin youtube it's your boy geek lynx here coming to and on you through the power of the internet and today i'm going to be telling you guys about the time when i ate a 10 gram avb edible by the way avb stands for already vaped bud so when i was 18 for christmas my dad had got me a dry herb vaporizer and for the longest time i would just throw the brown vaped weed away because i thought there was no way to use it randomly one day i came across a youtube video titled avb edibles and watched it and they said that the marijuana goes through the decarboxylation process when it's vaped and can be made into edibles without making can of butter you can literally sprinkle it onto anything so for the next week i saved up all of my avb and weighed it out and it came out to be a quarter ounce i weighed out two grams and sprinkled it on top of some ice cream and made sure to put lots of chocolate syrup on it to mask the weed taste and i'm glad i did it was like eating dirt it got stuck in my teeth and it still had a very strong taste even with all the syrup but wasn't unbearable the 2 grams of abb fell close to 400 milligrams of medical grade edibles my body felt heavier though but i was also relaxed whereas at a high dose on medical edibles i would be feeling some anxiety or nausea but there was none of that so when i did the two grams it was a thursday so a school night and the next day friday i had to close during that time of my career at my job i would close with my buddy who we are going to call tyler for the story and i knew that he had a vaporizer so i asked if i could buy some avb off of him and he said sure dude how much do you need i told him my plan for that night which was to do 10 grams and said that i had 5 grams and needed 5 more he then sold me the five grams and we closed the store as usual i went home took a shower like normal and after that i went into the kitchen and got the biggest bowl i could find in the house and filled it up with ice cream i ended up using half a gallon i brought the bowl back to my room and dumped all 10 grams of avb onto the top of the ice cream and folded the weed in each bite was super grainy and i could feel all the weed going down my throat as i swallowed i almost choked on a piece as it wasn't fully ground up because sometimes i would take pieces of weed and vape them without putting them through a grinder after a few minutes of struggling through the ice cream i took my last bite and set my spoon down i was so excited for the experience to begin but my stomach was rumbling as i am lactose intolerant my stomach couldn't handle all that ice cream i had the most intense stomach ache ever during the come up but as soon as the edible high reached its peak my stomach ache went away as soon as the stomach ache went away the spins began and i literally saw the room spinning around me i could almost see a 360 degree view of my room it was like an out-of-body experience i closed my eyes for a bit because seeing the whole room spin around was nauseating and while my eyes were closed i started to get some closed eye visuals i saw mandalas and sacred geometry all outlined by a blue light i opened my eyes after some time had passed and the spinning head stopped and i looked around my room and noticed the walls were moving melting and moving in and out as if they were breathing now my walls are colored green and have that popcorn texture to it and as i was staring at the wall i noticed the popcorn texture had a bluish green hue to it and was like the wall shadow it was flowing like water and the dots on the wall were popping out at me i thought the weed high had plateaued by that point but i was wrong i kept getting higher and higher and the spins came back i laid on the floor with my heart beating out of my chest just watching the ceiling flow all while listening to a lo-fi playlist that i had put on earlier i eventually fell asleep from the megadose of weed and woke up the next morning i was still high and went out into the kitchen to get something to eat and while standing there my mom came out to see what i was doing i was wobbling back and forth as i felt as if i were being pulled by an invisible force she asked why i was doing that and i told her i took too much sleep medicine and was nauseous she believed me and went back to her bedroom for the rest of the day i felt nauseous and lethargic i just laid in bed and watched youtube and the day after that was better and i just went back to my normal routine of working coming home eating sleeping repeat well there you guys go that was my experience of eating 10 grams of avb i hope you boppers enjoyed it imma get out of here and chill on my new discord server link in the description my name is geek links and i'm outtie 5000 peace boppers [Music] you", "VWrYRMJQJVA": "[Music] is it true buds TV edibles review we're looking at the Chiba choo 100 milligram caramel hybrid it looks delicious I got a discount on this one I think I got it for like 10 they retail for around like 13 bucks which you know for the price that's a little steep I mean there are other ones I think the tootsie roll type the chocolate a fees are around the same price point if I'm not mistaken so let's open this baby up comes a little foil wrap let's see if it's broken into segments or knots okay just like the other ones a little widow can be a little tricky it's not broken up but that's all good so it's a hundred so what I'll do is get about half of that more almost three quarters Panama's case is down pretty strong actually has a nice caramel feel to it though but let's see if it actually really does a trick for the price point taste is good there are no other products are cool too but the price is a little high I'll come back to you in a little while and I'll hope I am just that so it's about an hour and a half later and it's pretty chill laid-back nothing too crazy no anxiety not two blades honestly I thought it was gonna be a little stronger but still decent I'm sorry to say Chiba Chu I will not be buying your caramel again I don't think it's the best bang for the buck but if you are a caramel enthusiast suggest trying it as you can see though I did an evil thing I probably line it up on the chart here I ate probably about 70 milligrams which you know but still cool and I'm not completely hating keep it choose a legit brand this is just the least favourite out of your products for me what if you like [Music]", "0U0rdKe97q8": "[Music] dirty folks welcome back to wheats the marijuana advil review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are looking at another product from the fine folks at canakkale we are looking at their triple chocolate brownie 250 milligrams today so I have looked at one other product from chemical in the past there are PB&J blondie which I like quite a bit and now we're back with the triple chocolate brownie the same fancy packaging that Kanaka had before with their wonderful nutrition information their ingredients consumption advice fancy cardboard packaging again really nice packaging you probably pay a premium for it I believe this I think cost me 15 bucks so on the high end therefore a 250 milligram at a bowl alright so um let's look at back here the pure experience Kanaka is all about quality you can taste and depend on this is why we utilize the finest ingredients and laboratory tests all our handcrafted goods we are meticulous about our work because we are passionate about our products in

taste alrighty so just like the other canna co-product double packaged like this we got the outside fancy cardboard packaging and in the more traditional sort of zip bag on the inside so this is the first time you've ever tune into weights the way our reviews work here on wheats is I'm going to eat some measure of this brownie in front of you not necessarily the whole thing just because I don't want to bore you to death while I sit there and munch on a brownie but I will eat the whole brownie in the next few minutes and I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how this product is feeling alright so here we go let's open this up oh wow this is a very nice-looking brownie look at this bad boy it's got some white chocolate shavings on the tops and chocolate chips on the inside if nothing else that is a handsome handsome product Wow smells just like a brownie no real weed owner whatsoever now for the taste test that's a straight-up good rally I would eat this plate no we taste but do you - we're top lady with weight of it [ __ ] okay well this can occur certainly past the taste test this is top tier tasting edible um you know top 1% for sure but it's not necessarily on how it tastes it's more about how it makes you feel and point that I will have to come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling so I will see you guys then thank you so much for watching weights we'll see you soon peace welcome back tweets guys I have got to say straight off the back here that Kanaka has hit a home run man with their triple chocolate brownie top to bottom amazing tastes incredible and I am super high for a 250 milligram and a bowl I am as pleased as punch holy oh I've had edibles that claim to be you know 500 milligrams that haven't hit as hard as this triple chocolate brownie I like this quite a bit more than the peanut butter PB&J blondie I think it was called PB&J blondie I think I like it quite a bit more than that and I liked that too so that's saying a lot I don't have enough good things to say about it other than it has 500 calories so you know it's gonna not do a lot of favors for your waistline but you're going to enjoy it so you know hey you only live once the Kanaka triple chocolate brownie gets the wheats highest honor whatever that is we don't have that but if we did have such a thing or a program or an honorific or something like that this brownie would be bestowed that so if you see this at a dispensary near you be sure to grab one or two or five of the Kanaka triple chocolate brownie thank you so

grounding this is like chakra status guys this is chakra the promoting chakra status so let's open the vape pen it slides out i'm so excited to try this uh it's stuck here we go oh it's just a charger with a sleek pen all right see it looks like this all right and then this is the charger that goes with it a usb charger if you had any of this before you just screw that in i guess do i have to charge it now is there any instructions oh here we go has a little bit of instructions they gave me silver i don't know if i chose silver specifically but on off settings push button five times change heat settings push button three times preheating set settings push button two times charging up to four hours or when light turns green okay so i don't know if it's charged yet doesn't say and this is my oil it looks like this they had this one that was called fruit fruity loops i was gonna try but i didn't know if this fit inside the thing i wanted to use but look it looks like this and the top is rounded and the oil is in there i don't know if you've seen that but um the oil's in there in the reservoir it's pretty cool all right let's stop this cheddar chatter and try it hopefully it's charged i really hope so i'm gonna go ahead and screw this in 0.5 ml that's how much okay okay i don't know how tight i'm supposed to why is it crooked is it crooked this is weird all right okay so what is it how do you do this charging press button two times i hope it's on oh on off one two three four five oh look it was red now one two it's preheating now it's preheating pictures of products are not to scale cartridge not included how come this tip is different from the other tips the other tips look like they're like more not not as rounded is it done now what do you do i don't know how to do this you have to hold the pen you have to hold the button i mean so bubble gum tastes like a weird light version of medicine let me try again it's like i don't know what it's supposed to do at the moment this is just interesting it's like i feel like it's something supposed to happen like right away it's light i taste a little tint of bubble gum but it's very subtle very subtle i don't see no nothing as of now but it's pretty cool i don't know let's try one more that's cool though maybe i'll feel an effect later i feel like i feel like i don't know if it's the placebo effect but i feel like a calmness settling or i could just be bugging out i don't know but this is cool i guess i'll do an update on another video to see my thoughts on it like some vlog type stuff so that's it that's all i have for you today i'm gonna do some more videos so check those out i'll see you next time bye you", "P7aLZ7R5RSg": "you can scratch all ten of them down nothing hi guys welcome back to my channel

thing in the morning hi welcome to and anything show and today I'm going to show you how to make homemade wheat chocolates that's right folks it's time that we bring leads to the forefront people I mean it's legal basically everywhere except for I love and I recently came into possession of a large quantity of marijuana so when that happens my favorite thing to do is make cannabutter 500 milligrams of THC right here folks making chocolate at home doesn't appear to be that difficult it's basically just a cacao or cocoa powder a sweetener butter and whatever else you feel like adding in this case we're gonna use some hemp arts you can make it in between like plastic bags so that's like a bark or even better you have ice cube trays or like these silicone molds silicone molds that was weird so I'm gonna put some in here and then I also have these awesome weed ice cube tray molds my boyfriend actually got them from his office as a Christmas party because they all think that he's like this huge pothead meanwhile the kid hardly ever smokes weed he just looks stoned half the time so if any of you are watching this I'm calling you out and you do not smoke pot you are not some pothead that everyone thinks you are and the only person that is using these is me I'm concerned slightly that they're brave when they pop out so we'll see what happens I'm gonna do a few in here and a few in here I'm also going to use this maple syrup which is from New Hampshire keeping it local I'm gonna use some vanilla extract with Jam and I just got a Mexico if you haven't seen those vlogs to check them out so this is local to Mexico and I'm gonna use this wheat butter that I made and the weed my frame grew and its local to Western man so sourcing maybe we are sourcing local we're sourcing regional or keeping them heavy in this kitchen the first thing we're gonna do 1/2 cup of coconut oil which is okay and next we're gonna add in 1/2 cup of cacao now with this recipe I'm gonna try to make 10 chocolates with it so I did have to do a bit of crazy calculations but each serving is gonna be about 50 milligrams of THC so this is not for beginners of edibles but I'm no beginner you know the reason I'm mixing everything in this mason jar making a [ __ ] mess already it's because I'm gonna use this immersion blender so we don't have lumps I thought mason jar be the easiest way of course they always thank you underestimated what a slob I am and now I'm annoyed [ __ ] [ __ ] my hair now [ __ ] is this how do people make like measuring stuff looks so easy I always make a mess they just pour out the powder into the half cup and just [ __ ] pours right now but when I do it the whole house needs to be cleaned we are coconut labor cacao now we need our half teaspoon of vanilla I'm really excited to use this stuff it's supposed to be very high quality I had to check my bag to bring him home and everything smells mmm smells like sunblock and vacation 1/2 teaspoon oh we're gonna need three tablespoons of maple syrup it's so good I guess that's it so now we blend much easier than whisking that's for damn sure they're never gonna get all this [ __ ] off the sides because I'm on every last drop hmm how I shouldn't be doing this probably gonna get pretty high by the way I cancelled my dentist appointment this morning I'm not like a counselor of things but we got snow last night it was for two fillings but like they're very small cavities and that's totally not an emergency and I really didn't like spending $200 so you know what I cancelled I felt guilty about it but then as soon as I did it I was like that was the best decision I made hopefully don't charge me okay so now comes the interesting part we want to weigh these out evilly because I want each chocolate to be the same amount of THC so I'm gonna use this 1/2 tablespoon and I'm gonna try to make 10 of these okay we're gonna do a few in the weed chocolate mole because I just think that will look really cool but it might prove to be too difficult and you might have to give it up let's see how it goes in here oh yeah much better - you're gonna add a little bit to each once they're all the same size so now I just want to get you know my place this is gonna be to hide right here well use my hands like I'm getting aggressive right now I'm definitely going after this one mmm just gotta get in there verified me I'm gonna get stoned first thing morning so I also have these hemp parts which you know hemp is also derived from the cannabis plant how'd you get these from Canada because as you know it's still illegal here no plant that like basically does everything let's make it illegal so I'm gonna sprinkle some of these into some of my chocolate just to add like a fun crunch a little bit not every single one but and it just uses chopstick to cut us the world I have into the chocolate a little bit yeah if these come out well the next ones I make I'll probably add like walnuts or something all right so all that's left is putting these in the fridge or the freezer and they're supposed to harden within an hour the next time you see them though it'll be like when I'm going to eat them for the night so I'm gonna keep them in there all during the day I have to do work now let's start my day so we'll see you guys later when it's time to test these bad boys out okay guys it is hours later the day has passed I have popped the chocolates out of the molds as predicted Lee we the mold it was mostly for aesthetic purposes because it really didn't pop out that well my definitely won't do it like that again but it froze them and this is what this one looks like it's very cute you know this is like very gimmicky but in reality in terms of like consistency and uniformity the silicone circular molds were the move anyway I just ate one of these scouts honor scared what is this scout the scouts honor I just ate one of these it's the Shocker oh I just any one of these Dan can attest to it I'm not gonna eat another one because that will be a hundred milligrams of THC and that's something that we're gonna save for another day by another day I mean tomorrow I'm gonna store these in the freezer I think they'll heat for like at least a month they won't be around that long but I love it I'm so proud of myself what an easy way to make weed chocolates at home and a lot more affordable than buying them at the stores now you can buy them in the stores here anyway you have to be on your deathbed one of these days anyway thank you for watching this episode of add anything show and I will see you next time goodbye Nana you don't want these okay if you had like pointing up but I can't see anything [ __ ] meatball go [ __ ] yourself okay guys", "XIdIT1-r4pU": "what's up

would say like I have half a milliliter a half a capful Oh quickest drug that you can do because this stuff is just make sure you don't want no more than that that's the perfect amount stir that in there mix in there first before you put your concentrating in writing down turn down the heat all the way too low make sure we're making this you be patient because you want to make sure you strike you know concentrate in chocolate at the right temperature so it can go into the mold and a perfect temperature so you're concentrating don't it's like they're so careful two minutes okay so now I think this is at the right temperature and we have our concentration different prices different purities [Music] the glass is not everybody is D car now let's say you can you guys can your shadow because just the way you can use wax butter whatever make this stuff we could use rising chips now and don't make the boy yourself with MCT oil but you got to make sure that when you make it you just come decarboxylate whatever type of format [Music] start blowing the molds okay it's filling up there [Music] they see me I don't have patience for this it's easier to pour chocolate into the mold so the chocolate doesn't start stiffening up on I don't know how many chocolates wasn't gonna get starts in the next one we got it like those settle down let's see what we got there it's making more than me expected you really use the rest of this to make sure [Music] [Music] you take this some - off and added something - so this is like the neatest job do you know what made me think that is is because everybody likes camisa so why the gummies was very like such a hick like a big hick when you get this right when you get the edibles right data almost like the best ways [Music] so so cuz I'm out of that big one over there anyone that means we should be the main thing guys is you wanna make sure [Music] even now we still have some leftover chocolate so you scrape that in last one this is

"2Es9trMOWkI": "welcome to County basics today we learn how to make double dose chocolate marijuana brownies [Music] what do you do with classic weed brownies just doesn't do the trick you make double dose chocolate marijuana brownies and hop up the THC with two layers of cannabis infused chocolate heaven the main brownie is loaded with cannabutter and the icing is also infused with cannabis coconut oil but you could also use butter in that layer too either way these double dose brownies are guaranteed to be a kick in the pants this episode of canna basics is brought to you by the roughhouse studios smoke shop selling vaporizers wax pans rolling papers and accessories from raw and much more at great prices save 10% on everything all the time with the code canna basics and roughhouse studios.com now here's what you need to make the brownies but be sure to note that the icing ingredients are towards the end of the video you need 1/2 a cup of cannabutter a cup of white sugar 2 eggs a teaspoon of vanilla extract 1/3 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder 1/2 a cup of all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder now unless you already have some kind of either made the first step is going to be to make your cannabutter you can definitely use pre bought or store-bought cannabutter for this but we're gonna make our own there'll also be a link in the description and at the end of the video to see how we made this water method of making cannabutter but the first step is going to be to manicure your cannabis make sure that you break it up take out any stems and seeds and then decarboxylate activate it an oven 350 degrees for 30 minutes while that's baking you want to also clarify your butter clarifying your butter it means that you're removing all of the milk solids so that you have a nice yellow pure clear butter oil this will make it more bioavailable it'll also help make the infusion more strong when you infuse the marijuana after your marijuana has decarboxylated it's gonna be lightly toasted brown and we're going to combine that with the butter and then we're also going to combine some water an equal part of butter and water that's one cup of each and then we're also going to add in the cannabis and that's about a 1/2 ounce of of cannabis there and you can definitely vary the amount of cannabis depending on the potency that you want and if you make this amount of cannabis butter you'll have more than enough to do the recipe that we're making today and you'll also have about a quarter cup left over and you can also do like we're doing it combined and you were using part coconut oil and we're also using part of this infused butter but now you got going to strain out your after you've infused for at least two hours over a double boiler you're going to strain out the cannabis and then to separate the water from the butter you could put that in refrigerator for a couple hours and let the water settle to the bottom and then the butter reforms at the top and then you have a nice very good flavored a little bit lighter colored sometimes than other cat about is because you can see the rust colored waters left over there but that's taking away some of the bitter flavor and chlorophyll and impurities away so you have a very clean and a pure butter that's left over its gonna taste delicious and our brownies okay so now we're going to move on to making the brownies [Music] okay we'll begin our brownies by first putting our half a cup of Canada butter over a medium saucepan bringing that up until it's melted and just before it starts to get too hot and start to brown so you want it hot but not not starting to smoke or anything like that so make sure you don't brown the butter and then after it's hot throw it put it in a a dish like a pyrex dish here and then add in your cup of sugar we're good doing this to help melt the sugar and also to cool off the butter so that when we add our egg and next it won't cook our egg so then add in your eggs one at a time and mix those in and then we're also going to add in the vanilla extract it's one teaspoon of vanilla extract again mixing it well and once we have our wet ingredients in there we're gonna now first add in our cocoa and once I add in the cocoa I want to go ahead and mix that in because cocoa can be really messy so I like to go ahead and get the cocoa mixed in before I had in the rest of the dry ingredients so I've got the cocoa mixed and now I'm adding in the flour all-purpose flour one cup I'm adding in a half a cup at a time so it mixed in the first half a cup and now I'm going to add in the second half a cup of flour but then I'm also going to add in the baking powder as well as the salt we're gonna continue mixing that until I have that oh very well incorporated it could take a couple of minutes and what's that well until it's nice and glossy and fully combined now we're going to go ahead and spray and flour my pan I've also lined it in foil that'll just help me pull the brownies out of the hand when I go to cut them but go ahead and oil and flour that generously or they may stick now we're gonna add in the brownie batter you can see the brownie batter is really thick and dark and there's gonna be some really good fudgy brownies so I've got that I'll pour it in the pan I've hit the pan once on the table and let it settle in there and now we're gonna bake the brownies these brownies bake at 325 degrees for 20 minutes you want to sure you keep an eye on those you don't want them to get too Brown but you also want to make sure they get done and you can use a toothpick and stick it in the center if it comes out clean you know they're done [Music] and now while our brownies are cooking we're going ahead and combine all the ingredients for our frosting which is 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder a cup of powdered sugar 3 tablespoons of cannabutter or cannabis infused coconut oil a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a tablespoon of honey we're to combine all of those ingredients into a medium bowl and we'll be combining those all together and in this instance we're using a coconut oil that we already had made that's a really strong coconut oil we want these double those brownies to be really potent so we're using this really extra strong coconut oil but you could also use the same butter that you used in the first half of the recipe you could use that butter or any kind of cannabis infused butter or coconut oil for this part of the recipe and then we've combined all our ingredients here and now we're going to use a spatula or metal spoon and make that combined together into our frosting and ours was really dry so I added in actually some of the butter I ended up adding some of that in as well too to wet it some so that it was the consistency of her frosting it was still a little bit thick but that's ok because we're gonna frost these while the brownies are still hot so we're gonna let the heat of the brownies kind of help melt this fudgy icing it which is more kind of another layer of brownies than it is actually in icing but it just really is delicious and it really adds to the potency especially if you use a really strong oil for this top layer but what you're using is you're letting the heat of the brownies that have come out of the oven they're completely done but they're still warm and we're spreading this fudgy icing over the top of it and we're letting the heat of the brownies kind of melt that icing so that it forms a nice sort of dense layer of fudge on top of these brownies and once that's cooled off you're gonna be able to especially if you use the foil just lift it right up out of the pan and cut these I cut these into 12 sections so that would be at 12 servings but it's up to you to cut them have any slices that you want they're kind of small brownies in this case but these are really rich they're almost almost like a piece of fudge they're very very rich and they're also very strong so the 12 slices was perfect and take a look at those dark and dense and I tell you these are some dank and strong brownies one of these is enough for a serving two of them will really kind of get your mind blown if you use a strong infusion like we did here they're very moist and I used a really high-quality cocoa so they have a real rich dark chocolaty

homemade chocolate bars I'm gonna show you how to do a dark chocolate bar a milk chocolate bar and a white chocolate bar as you can see here we have a double boiler setup no waters on the inside waters on the outside now you can set up your double boiler however you want to you have a smaller pot but a bigger bowl but you know use whatever you have I have a pie rack a Pyrex measuring cup that I'm using that's why I don't have like a dishcloth or something underneath this because this is very thick so I don't worry about this breaking so what we're gonna do is we're going to take our butter and we're going to put this in here there we go as always if you want to see the exact measurements of everything that I'm doing click the lateness in the description is going to take you over to Good Eats 420 com where I'll give you step-by-step instructions plus the exact measurements of everything that I'm doing so we're going to just let the double boiler to start to go and then we're going to melt down this butter that's what we're gonna do right now [Music] all right so we're melting this down we're gonna make sure that it's melted down fully there we go double boiler so you want that water to start boiling all right I think that's good all right so that's nice and melted now so we're going to go ahead and separate this into three different containers those be doing three different bars let's do it all right so we're going to break this up into three parts we're gonna put the four tablespoons in each one [Music] so in the recipe that I tweaked in order to come up with this recipe they actually use cocoa butter to make their bars I actually use our special butter here so I didn't really know if it was gonna work or not so after you have it divided into three equal bowls you're going to use different ratios in order to come up with a different bars for this first dark chocolate bar I'm using two tablespoons of cocoa powder two tablespoons of powdered sugar and a pinch of salt for the other two bars there's different ratios if you want to know the exact measurements of everything that I'm doing go ahead and hit the link it's going to take you over to goodies 420 com well I will give you the exact measurements of every single bar [Music] [Music] now on the third one on the white chocolate bar it actually is white chocolate but I didn't like the consistency the way it was coming together I couldn't get it to come together without any lumps so I put some cocoa powder in there in order to get it to loosen up and come together the way I wanted it to you want to actually stir this together each bowl whenever you put in your bars together you want to stir it together until there's no lumps and then you pour it inside of your mold so that's what you see me doing right now once we do that I put it inside the freezer and let it set up for an hour and then I'll show you what it looks like after we do that all right so we had this in the freezer setting up and we're gonna see what the outcome is first time doing it let's try to here's the first part that we tried the dark chocolate very nice and there's the first bar dark chocolate [Music] just try the milk chocolate one that we tried out [Music] see how this came out I'm pulling the decides away from it just to be sure as my sticking at all on these molds then once I have the sides done if I'm going underneath it and trying to attach it from the bottom very nice look at that look at that milk chocolate look at that very cool we got two layers to milk in the chocolate ooh that's nice okay and as you can see right here this is 24 squares per bar and so we'll go into the dosage after this all right so for this one right here this was supposed to be a white chocolate bar but the way that it was coming together I added some chocolate to go ahead and make it come together right so it's good to see what happens with this one this was the one that I was worried about right here good like I said this was supposed to be white chocolate but the way that it was coming together just wasn't coming together or blending I should say the right way so I'm gonna see what happens there we go so you see we did the cannabis leaves on there and there we are how to make your own chocolate bars if you're interested in everything that I put in here click the link that's in the description if

bunch of work it's still the a.m. but I got something up next and it's an edible bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang so we're looking at bang chocolates powered by Endeavour indivi just because uninterested let's see let's pull them up on the old Weber site here of course we have the begin age gate day 20 month April and year whatever makes me old enough 1933 enter ok here we go in Devon in diba who knows we don't really care it's just a company it's just a brand sometimes we care I'm not sure about this they're doing pre-rolls they're doing cannabis salt interestingly like Emma the salt it's an interesting one here we got dark chocolates gummies White Russian Bud cannabis sugar okay so I got a variety of edibles let's check out their packaging cuz that's part of it nowadays it's interesting they have for this this is milk chocolate this is dark chocolate the packaging is different sizes that means they just had a whole bunch of packaging lying around they're trying to make it work right they're making it work they're doing it alright so here we go ten milligrams in each bag total THC per unit is one piece one piece of chocolate in here I can see that feel that this one's milk chocolate also one piece let's see their package date this is their package date March 10th 2020 it doesn't even say package date I don't know what that date actually now I'm confused this is the package date it doesn't say package date and then this is the expiry date the date that's in the future that's what makes sense there to me alright package date on this guy is April 6th April 6 so very relatively close I got both milk chocolate dark chocolate to see what the [ __ ] is going on in here do you like chocolate I love chocolate I like milk chocolate sometimes I like dark chocolate ingredients we've got the sugar bittersweet chocolate whole milk powder just a bunch of chocolate stuff I'm not [ __ ] reading that but I do like the expiry date the cookie I had from Aurora I never had an expiry date very weird to eat have food without an expiry date it's open these up alright let's start with milk sugar dark chocolate because I like it less so boom we're tearing that open like that you see and we're also going to there's a childproof sort of seal on here and this is how you open these is a little flap here you want to grab that then you want to open this flap up in here you just pull that side and the shoe opens right up that's how if you're a child don't watch that that's the key to open a hotel group and here we have chocolate it can be broken up into four sections that's what that one looks like let's just bring out the milk chocolate as well so we have it both out here much smaller package on this one even how they have directions on the back of it - how to open children can understand pictures - just let me point that out there and then we have the milk okay bang-bang all right let me get in here we're gonna try this one first let's snap that one snap that one dark chocolate mmm very dark now what I'm looking for is the percentage of cacao usually when you deal with dark chocolate or chocolates - milk cow is there like percentages of cacao so that you [ __ ] know what you're in for once you're so high in in [ __ ] cacao darkness it can be really bitter this is too bitter for me it's cotton it's a really dry chocolate it tastes like nothing but chocolate she's bitter but if you like that go that way let's try the milk chocolate it's not like your just your standard regular old chocolate not like your Easter Bunny milk chocolate there's that's a little better there's a little pop I'm actually quite happy with that good job so ten milligrams per four pieces that's 20 milligrams total between the two bags of chocolate I'm just gonna eat the rest I'm a mix of chocolate and the brook toggle together Laura price right 4:49 great price actually that is some of the that's me a second so four dollars and fifty cents to get 10 milligrams of THC in some pretty good chocolate bang bang on bang on good for you you're making it work so you got some extract and you managed to put it in a chocolate and put it out to the consumers at a good price this is just a regular ol edible and if you're looking to dip your toes you can get as small to 2.5 milligram dose even 1.125 found $1 whatever 1.25 dose - if you want to break those little cubes in half if you wanted to bite that now you've got a one point two five milligram dose great for beginners cool for beginners this is a 2.5 milligram dose when it's broken down but for four dollars and fifty cents yeah if you're just a beginner in a lightweight yeah let's go these are fighting just get more ever give up that's a win I got these that spirit leap bang-bang tasty little chocolates spirit leaf West Kelowna shout out go grout that's cheap especially if 10 miligrams works for you five bucks boom grab - 10 bucks boo boo it's time to smoke some weed now that's it [Applause] yeah chuckle it stop guys stop [ __ ] with the guns [Music]", "oQhItiXuOJ0": "[Music] parents look closely at this picture it looks like regular coughs syrup if you saw it in your childhood room would you think twice about it it's called cush the drug got a Miami Dolphins player arrested in Collier County this week and then he was cut from the team we sent NBC to investigator David Hodges to find out what it is and you know if these illegal drugs are hidden in plain sight being a big issue for parents and Peter the biggest danger is that they're far more pwned than anything parents may have seen or even tried when they were young so to help your kids we're gonna help you spot them at a quick glance you might not recognize it what does this look like to you ketchup pills that looks like marijuana syrup the final answer is correct Kush syrup found in the car of Miami Dolphins player and Collier County sold in a medical marijuana dispensary in California but not untouchable for kids in South West Florida pretty much everything through online channels you can figure out a way together Steven hill helps kids with substance abuse at Sal's care he says teens will try something like Co syrup just because it's new but I just think it's a different way to do it different and possibly more dangerous syrup has a thousand milligrams of THC the active principle of marijuana per bottle and if taken all at once 10 to 20 times what you're typically going against smoking a joy the side effects would be palpable a lot of times very erratic hallucinations and you can also get psychosis on a temporary basis so the the judgment and your behaviors are definitely impacted grown-ups don't know Lesley Robinson is founder of Street chicks and recovery which runs a marijuana adolescent prevention program in Lee County middle schools she also produces videos helping educate kids about some of the side effects of marijuana in products like Co syrup and it's so potent you're gonna be able to tell your child is high she says the best way for parents to spot these drugs is to pay attention to the new products on the market educate yourself on the other forms besides the bag and the smell the Collier County Sheriff's Office told us they don't recall ever making any arrests where this kind of syrup was down before but many of these drugs come and wave so the best advice for parents be on the lookout if you didn't buy it or authorize it question it for the NBC to investigators I'm David Hodges call email or download the NBC 2 news app

smell the raspberry you can definitely smell the raspberry and no disturb or weed smell no marijuana smell whatsoever all right well let's go to taste what a politician what you could definitely definitely do the raspberry but not an overpowering way and there's a there's definitely a hint of raspberry in there the chocolates good I got some chocolate chips or the Makani or the white chocolate chips in there as well very tasty and I don't get any hint of marijuana whatsoever in the the taste so you don't like the taste of marijuana wow that's pretty good okay it's a rich brown he's a fudgy air brownie um take me some effort to eat this bad boy um but in the taste spectrum I like it but because I prefer the chocolate lover's ecstasy cookie to this but you're not gonna be disappointed with this brownie for sure no weed flavor and just generally a pretty good taste um oh also just like the chocolate livers and will keep very affordable this brownies 300 milligram edible only cost me $10 just on the low end but I'm sure you can find it for you around you know 12 to 15 bucks but yeah clip one very important duties bus well okay yeah I found this bad boy in a dispensary and Huntington Beach which is in Orange County California I think they're Buddha's best is pretty widely distributed at all um but as we know from all our earlier reviews the most important thing when it comes to an edible is not actually how it tastes it's how you feel afterwards and like miss my rubies I'll check back with you guys in half an hour and an hour and an hour or in two hours unless you know how we're feeling I'm gonna finish this bad boy off and I'll see you guys in half an hour hi guys so we are back here with our review of the Buddhist best triple chocolate raspberry brownie it has been 30 minutes since I have consumed this bad way except that crumb I just got right there um 30 minutes it feeling a little bit definitely feeling something and definitely feeling it increasing the feeling amplifying um finish off that brownie still really really enjoyed it oh not as good as I think the Korova cookies in terms of the taste I mean it's good it's very good but but

few one with the sixth of these of this that would be a wise investment buyer beware not because it isn't good but because it's too good no it's just right just a word of warning guys always follow

4 20 on ohio medical m j with ohio thc review this is an edible chocolate thc bar the bunanza coming at you from welsh springs 100 milligrams per bar and a little ziploc baggie and i'll tell you what this little chunk right here is in two easily separated pieces so it's 50 milligrams a piece as you can see it's labeled got their cute little logos thc on it it's outside chocolate inside a little bit of peanut butter no jelly though but you might want some after you take this hundred milligram bar the effects you gotta love it i'm telling you and it packs a punch in the inside it's kind of like a crispy treat it's a wavery little pop crispy and it is awesome i picked these up for ten dollars yes ten bucks for a hundred milligrams and that should be the everyday price they're very easy to eat they taste great and let's be honest after a hundred milligrams of edibles you're gonna feel good especially if you pair that with some willy's reserve which i got reviews coming up or maybe

press the subscribe button and yeah enjoy the video hey guys what is going on today we're taking a look at another wonka bar uh this time samoa's flavor um if you've not heard of these they are a i guess you could say black market edible brand um they make these chocolate bars in a ton of different flavors a ton of different candy flavors and cereal flavors i did a video on the captain crunch one i believe um but they also make a gummy edible which is more in a uh plastic bag um resealable bag type of thing but this is just wrapped in foil if we take a look at the back nutrition facts i'm not sure if they vary between flavor to flavor but um this is this one and may contain uh traces of nuts so be careful um i actually these are probably one of my favorite edible chocolate bar brands just because uh to me they're very reliable and you can scan right there for test results and i i think they're just they're pretty simple the ingredients simple milk chocolate natural flavor i don't i don't know exactly what that means but um let's crack this bad baby open they come in the outer outer plastic sleeve you could say oh normally this comes with it but i've already eaten a few pieces so the packaging got a little messed up you can see do they say oh they do say girl scouts i feel like that's kind of risky they're straight using the brand even the symbol right there but i'm assuming if it's a black market company they probably don't care very much about uh ripping off a brand or whatever but um so i am not so if you don't know samoa's i think it's like caramel and coconut and i am not a fan of uh either of those but i really did not mind this at all the flavor isn't too crazy strong and i kind of like the textural like the little bits of coconut that kind of get in your teeth and stuff when you're chewing i kind of don't mind that it adds some texture so it's not just plain milk chocolate um i actually think these are pretty high quality for what they are um and definitely probably stronger than a lot of i guess dispensary uh edibles or whatever because you know those are usually pretty limited to a hundred milligrams 25 milligrams whatever it is but in these types of dark or black market edibles i can get it can get dangerous because you really have no idea how much are in these these are advertised at 300 milligrams but there is really no way to tell so you have to be super careful um my advice if you're a heavy smoker i'd eat one of these one square i would wait a while maybe an hour or so eat another one and go from there just be super careful if you have never eaten any sort of this before just be extremely careful um and obviously edibles affect everyone differently some people could eat this whole bar um like you know like a lot of my friends could eat this whole thing and be like yeah i'm feeling good bro but it affects everyone differently i'm extremely i'm very underweight so if i ate you know one row of these um i'd be i'd be maybe bordering some sort of panic attack or something so they very edibles do me horribly when i eat them they oh man i get rocked um so if you're like me and extremely vulnerable to edibles i'd be you had to be careful to start with just this one and even if you're experienced it's always a good idea to be careful because you have no idea what exactly the exact ingredients inside these things so i would definitely recommend these as long as they're coming from a source that you trust um make sure they're coming from a trustworthy source and that's really all you can do from that perspective but yeah there's a ton of different flavors uh one of my favorites is if you forget if it's twix or uh i think it's like snickers or something that was really good but yeah if you've tried these let me know what flavor you've tried and if you enjoyed it i have tons of videos like this on my channel i also have a gaming channel if that is something that interests you i'm going to be posting a lot more now or soon because i got a my gaming computer all set up built so uh yeah maybe stream from this channel every once in a while uh yeah i hope everyone has a good day later", "4P2-eqMOeT8": "[Music] welcome to week skies the marijuana review show and I'm the one with the cavalier lis throwing around these scissors and I've got scissors in my hand not because I'm reviewing scissors I'm sure that there probably is a market out there for somebody who wants to review scissors no I've got scissors because I'm here to open a tough package one that I knew I'm gonna have trouble with but one that I am excited for because it is my one of my favorite kinds of edibles and that is the chocolate bar ooh the Sun is making that very difficult to see bad son bad bad son la familia it's the product of Los Angeles the mint flavor I read all the Spanish in English oh it looks like there's like four years of Spanish paid off so this is the la familia de la I almost said that terribly mint to flavor 200 milligrams of THC really that is quite obnoxious how that shows up they're very thin curtains I have um very simple packaging on this it's just like a little aluminum wrapper on this green kind of iridescent packaging you can feel not much to it again just like a sticker on an aluminum packaging it does have nutrition facts and ingredients on the back which is great but no lab test results so this is came from a black market or gray market dispensary in California because we all we all know all legal edibles are now 100 milligram edibles topped and they have to be ten servings or more this is an old-school 200 don't give a [ __ ] how many servings so let's go ahead and cut open the top here take a look at this chocolate bar give it a taste and if you've never tuned in before and if you have tuna before you must really [ __ ] hate here this by now but if you haven't the way of the reviews work here on weeds is I'm gonna eat a little bit of this here in front of you not necessarily the whole thing because I don't want to bore you to death but rest assured I'll eat this whole thing and then after I finish it I will come back to you guys in another two hours write us about when you'd be peaking to let you know how the product is actually hitting because that's what you're really in it for that's what you really care about is you know is it really gonna make you is it really gonna work not so much how it tastes okay Wow a very basic looking chocolate bar here totally basic it doesn't even have like an imprint with their logo on it or anything it is just what 12 squares of or twelve rectangles of chocolate I'm not gonna break it off into single rectangles let's just give it bite on three it smells like no I don't really detect a cannabis odor to it definitely a mint odor I'm a fan of mint chocolate I know there are a lot of mint chocolate haters out there I don't understand that but teach their own okay that's pretty good chocolate I'm decent quality chocolate for sure the mint flavor is not overwhelming I've definitely had some mint chocolates that are way more minty flavor more of a hint of mint here which is nice really no cannabis tasting I can't really detect much of any no hmm well what I hope that means is the chocolate is excessively masking the flavor of the cannabis and not that there's not 200 milligrams of THC in there mmm I never got to mention I picked this up on at the dispensary that I mentioned for $17 I believe which is two dollars more than they charge for a two hundred and thirty sixty milligram delta-9 which are excellent so high expectations for the la familia mint 200 milligrams here well guys I'm gonna eat another nine squares of this and then I will be back to you as I said in two hours let you know how it's hitting thanks for watching weights guys see in just a bit peace [Music] it's two hours later hi guys welcome back uh it has been 2 hours since I had the la familia and that still does not show up very well on this camera and I apologize for that there's a little bit of a better angle and the familiar the family that la familia is together families together is my review the end no my more elaborate view is it's pretty good it's not the most potent chocolate bar I've ever had chocolate bars are usually I believe the strongest and best vector for THC this one doesn't feel like a - like a kiva equivalent to me certainly not not even close really but it's still pretty good I'm at about a 6 right now some somewhere in that range so it's not you know terrible I've had 200 milligram edibles that are way worse and it didn't it tasted pretty good there's really no cannabis taste so you know on the whole I it's not the best you know there are certainly better chocolate bars out there I still would even probably recommend one of the new Kiva 100 milligrams over this la familia 200 milligram but if it's although your dispensary has and you like the chocolate bars this one's got a good taste it'll still do the job it's just probably not honest about that 200 milligrams would be my guess so if you have no other options and you like chocolate grab it otherwise go with one of the better brands pick up a kiva pick up a default say even probably a chill that one doesn't taste as good but I think it's more potent so stick with the bit the bit better brands if you can otherwise la familia is not a bad alternative and that is gonna do it for this review and before I go I'm gonna give you a very quick cherry on top guys just a soup quick little cherry on top something just so delightful and hairy I'll get you out of here real quick and that is cursing swearing profanity I mean I've been profanity since before my teenage years [ __ ] I [ __ ] love cursing it's the [ __ ] [ __ ] damn [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] it's great um if you if you don't curse a lot you should curse more if you don't curse at all what the [ __ ] is wrong with you cursing is the best the science is on my side you know they say that people who curse are more intelligent they're more honest they're more empathetic I've read that they actually have bigger dongs and that they're also better lovers to that I most of those are things that I've read so uh curse say [ __ ] a lot you'll like it la familia it's not that shitty thank you for sticking around to the end of this cherry on top thank you for sticking tuned to the end of this review appreciated Alice always guys it's been a [ __ ] blast see on the next week's peace", "_dOlRs0n-88": "hey everyone and welcome to have been a pan today we'll be showing you how to make CBD infused chocolates so when you think of making chocolates the first thing that comes to mind is just melting a chocolate bar or chocolate chips right while this makes sense for reshaping chocolate or adding condiments like peanuts and almonds to chocolate if you want to infuse happily chocolate the easiest way to do so is by adding in a few butter or oil but by doing so it'll change the balance of the ingredients in the chocolate and just make it less chocolaty and sweet so while this is fine because of how easy it is what if I told you that to make your own chocolate from scratch it only takes three ingredients because that's exactly how many ingredients it takes to make dark chocolate cocoa cocoa butter and sugar you can add in powdered milk to make milk chocolate or take out the cocoa and add in vanilla to make white chocolate but first things first infusing how we have cocoa butter we start off first with decarboxylated an ounce of hemp to convert the CBD a to CBD by gravy and up and then baking it at 275 degrees for 20 minutes after that we use a double boiler we have a pot with simmering water on the bottom and then place our Bowl we have half a pound of cocoa butter in it on top of it so that the water isn't touching the bowl by doing this the ball stays around a hundred degrees and ensures that the butter will be hot enough to dissolve the zpd quickly off the buds and into the butter but not so hot that it'll evaporate tpd or burn the butter [Music] we'll leave this on the stove for about two hours to get all the cannabinoids off the plant and be sure to check the water level of the pot from time to time and add more water if it gets low now that we're done with that I'm gonna let it cool off for about thirty minutes so that's warm to the touch and then strain the butter with the cheesecloth to remove all the plant material [Music] now all you have to do is they'll place it back on the double boiler and add in half a cup of cocoa powder half a cup of powdered sugar and mix until it's smooth if you have a sifter definitely use it on the powders first to break it up more for a smoother consistency and if you don't own a sifter anything similar like a metal strainer will work as well to help break apart the powder now you can pour it onto a foil lined baking pan or any type of mold to give it the shape you want here I have a chocolate bar mold that I'm going to be using with the amount of chocolate I made there was enough for four large chocolate bars as well as a little leftover I poured into a foiled lined baking sheet so nothing goes to waste now you just want to set it for an hour or two in room temperature or in the fridge for about 30 minutes after that they're ready to eat if you're gonna be storing them wrap them with wax paper parchment paper or foil and store them in the fridge and that's it like the

twitter followers and instagram followers to the family remember to click the subscribe button below that way you can join the fam that way you don't miss out on any new episodes new giveaways and more let's get right to it on this video i'm going to tell you about the true chocolate bar that i picked up from true leave in tallahassee i paid 20 for this bar and it came in at 100 milligrams total divided into 10 squares of 10 milligrams each looks like a standard chocolate bar the ten squares are clearly marked and easy to split apart and a square does have a thc warning icon so you can easily tell its medicine the smell is that of delicious milk chocolate the flavor is only of milk chocolate there was no oil or wheat taste none of that i ended up eating the two pieces shown here to test the effects i did this since i eat edibles for my back pain on a daily basis so my tolerance for them is high for people new to edibles i recommend trying half of one piece waiting an hour and going from there on to the effects the first effect that failed was the stress of the two and a half hour commute to tallahassee fade away this left me completely relaxed and my head feels a little bit lighter than normal and it also feels like my eyesight takes a little bit longer to catch up to the movement of my head later on a gigantic smile came over me and i know it was a chocolate since i was dealing with a work issue at the time my chronic back pain is gone and it stayed gone through the effects there were also tingly shields every now and then when my skin was touched her air went on my skin this bar gives me high hopes for when they start doing strange specific edibles in the future the best part is that true leave has shown time after time that they're able to grow at an absurd rate so i bet the strength specific edibles won't be too far away plus my opinion that edibles is going to be tarnished by the fact that i eat edibles on a daily basis making my tolerance for them higher than normal so in my humble opinion these will work best for people who are not daily edible users can i work on the strain for sure the effects of this bar were strong enough to keep my mood balanced my back pain gone and kept me stressed and anxiety free this helped my work very big time i use this edible any time day or night i hope this helps you meditate right have a great day", "iJwdqt7ebmE": "yeah here we go here we go again what's up yo back with another review today Oh edible gummies Mira Mira specifically Rob hots sour flavors I believe this is a relative new relatively new flavor for them I'm not a million percent sure even close to sure if it's on the REC side if it's not now I would imagine it will be soon so diving in the flavors we got inside here blue raspberry grape and green apple I don't know I had to look at it I actually know the flavors of jelly me anyway that's pretty much my favorite flavors enjoy ranchers and other candies so that was a super big plus for me I'm not really a huge tower fan so I'm really hoping they're not especially a sour yeah I was gonna enter a picture probably already did or I am now so we're gonna dive into what one thing to keep in mind is the brain all right we go is that the milligrams posted on the bottle or on the container are not necessarily the exact amount that are in your specific bottle your specific bottle will have a separate location where it is located exactly how many milligrams are in there I will insert a picture of it but it's I just keep smearing it you cannot see it at all anymore but I know that this bottle says 500 milligrams and it has 467 point 6 4 milligrams in it meaning each piece is not 50 milligrams but 46.7 6 milligrams per gummy it will always tell you the specific amount of THC that is in and milligrams that is in your container but it's not always exactly what's on the bottle sometimes it's more though I had another bottle of greens but I ate before I could review sometimes it's more the greens were 500 and something milligrams so each milligram or 5/10 I think or anyway doesn't matter because it was 51 milligrams per gummy i remember that specifically so sometimes you're getting more sometimes getting less if you're really a budget conscious person and you want to really maximize your bang for buck check out the different flavors and see what milligram is the highest of the actual bottle that you'll be purchasing we're gonna move on to the scent also it doesn't say whether it's a hybrid or indica or sativa so that means it's a hybrid most edibles are pretty much hybrids anyway I'm to get a edible specific video posted so keep an eye out for that because I'm gonna give like tips tricks all kinds of different information about edibles specifically that you can apply across pretty much all edibles sauer sorry I'm getting a little bit of the grape but I'm gonna be completely honest with you guys these two are the two that I'm gonna be eating and one of them is great the reason these are the two that I'm gonna be eating is because I licked the [ __ ] out of them getting the sub nail photo and specifically the purple one is the one that I started with so it got the most saliva on it so I'm not sure if that has affected the scent that I'm picking up the most in here I'm like rotating something like the blue raspberries up on top I still kind of get great more than anything else behind this hour cuz this hour is the first thing that I smelled so that's a little bit concerning for me but when I was licking them I didn't taste a lot of sour however in the photo you can see there's a lot of like more there's a lot of rocky material that's only on one side from what I can tell because the green one too it didn't have any on the bottom I'm thinking that's the sour so I would imagine that you could dust that off and they wouldn't be sour but tact tactically they are I'm gonna grab one that I haven't wet because that they're more sticky Wow they're mean Wow I'm having before but they are they're very soft and compression they're definitely gummies cuz they're a little bit sticky but let's see yeah they're a little bit sticky my fingers are a little sticky after that but I could be because I was also handling the ones that I licked so we're gonna let see my fingers do not feel sticky at all or the like least amount like to smile if anything so now we're gonna squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze it is sticky yeah it's sticky and that's one that was not licked but it's not super bad cuz now after I've done it a few times it's pretty much not sticky anymore so a little sticky but you'll be able to like dust it off and no big deal as long as you don't like continuously looking and grab it and grab it and grab it that makes it sticky alright let's ride let's ride so I'm gonna be doing actually 150 because I'm gonna try all three well I was Jenni myself so harshly I'm like oh you're not getting quick enough that I couldn't actually think about adding up the numbers so it actually may be more like 135 levi's I am going to put the sour directly on my tongue with this one and then the other way on this one and whichever way I like the most I'm gonna do for the blue raspberry because that's my favorite and the apple looks like it's not got a lot of stuff on it so [Music] okay I push the gummy off to the side to just deal with the sour but it's really not bad like you can see my face with like a little bit but when it's really sour it's my faces all kinds of you know I am definitely getting a great flavor I would say that there is a mild earthy flavor to it I mean hash has a very very attached distillate has a very mild cannabis flavor to it but I'm picking that up so it's not but I I mean any edible honestly any edible is gonna have the slightest flavoring whether it be hashey or earthy which this is a little bit both I'm getting it's interesting you know I'm getting the earthiness of the you know cannabis component but which is in distillate but I'm also at the end getting a little bit of the tang or the dryness maybe that's it of the hash flavor if you have smoked hash or gotten it on it and like licked it and stuff you kind of know what I mean you the smell like honest if you know what the smell is you kind of know what the taste is so they're green apple oh and as far as I continue to talk the flavor I'm left with is a very mild grape kind of a again there's it's not really necessarily earthy at this point it's an off great like it's great but just like a little okay solid metal that straight-up tastes like Ukraine Apple the end part I got a little bit of sour and as I was coming out of it it tasted like a sour green apple so that was really nice not quite as much earthy flavor in that one I just think maybe the green apple complements or goes with the cannabis ever slightly so more than the grape so more I'm not really tasting the green apple anymore it was strong when I was eating it but it doesn't really have a leftover flavor and blue raspberry [Music] whoo Smiley's an idol I ate a boy okay that was delicious it honestly reminds me of a blue Slurpee but I I honestly don't think I've ever tried a Slurpee ever but it's what I imagine a blue raspberry a Slurpee tastes like blue raspberry otter pop that's the closest that I can relate it to cuz it's not quite blue raspberry Jolly Rancher but it's blue rounder blue blue raspberry otter pop so it's a little duller than a Jolly Rancher but still nicely blue raspberry we're popsicle I swallowed unexpectedly during that so some sour got in my throat so it's not the best feeling and I did just eat on three so I'm imagining the flavors gonna be a little ol kooky but I kind of maybe I just want it I feel like I have a remanence of blue raspberry in my mouth but I might just be wanting it so much that its existing you know for the placebo effect so flavors oh dude I didn't get any hash from that no earthy no hash maybe because I like that flavor so much or it goes better with it I don't know but it tasted delicious so that you know as far as overall experience I appreciate that the sour is not super sour I almost think there's gonna be people who are disappointed but it's not super super sour but I thought it was a nice mild level of sour what yeah I still get the grape more than anything in that particular whip waft I wonder if it's because I was also thinking it was gonna be so much more sour that I smelled this no I smell sour but it's not as strong it has before that's so funny anyway I love Rob hot gummies I've had them pretty consistently there's definitely other companies that make really good gummies but Rob hots from what I've experienced so far seems to be the best thing for the [ __ ] and having good quality like great quality gummies however I did want to mention gelatin and glucose syrup is in here I don't know how that relates to either vegetarianism or veganism all right so the milligrams are definitely affecting me at this point I'd say I'm Spacey relaxed [Music] I'm frontier I was more minute early and now I'm more relaxed and I think when I get to doing the video editing it'll be easier to focus than trying to pull thoughts out of this brain it's more just do versus think which is wonderful my hands are so dry my knuckles oh my gosh I need to get more lotion I have to go okay I just needed a quick thing yeah yes I would recommend rabbits gummies I would say pretty much overall at this point different flavors you you're gonna like and not like so that's gonna be a personal thing but overall I think that Rob Potts does a good job with their gummies and the sours were delicious and not super sour and I really like that I hope you guys have a wonderful rest of your day", "04Z0HQWeXyQ": "[Music] [Music] Red Seal chef Marcel here with cannabis wiki today we're gonna be making our keto friendly chocolate bars using unsweetened chocolate some honey and some wonderful drops from our licensed provider Aurora the drops we're using today are 28 milligrams per mil we're gonna put about 6 in there which is gonna bring us about 168 so 56 per chocolate bar as we're gonna make 3 chocolate bars today I know my molds already are 2 ounces each so I know that one of these is 4 ounces that's gonna do my two chocolate bars and that speakers unsweetened chocolate and so we're gonna break this one in half and then we have our bowl on a double boiler just to make sure that the chocolate doesn't scorch so all it is is a pan on the bottom with some paper towel wrapped around the outside and then your bowl set nicely on top the reason for that is because when you're tempering or melting chocolate it has a tendency to burn if you were to do it directly in a pan and once you burn or overheat chocolate you can't use it anymore so we've got our chocolate in there we're gonna add about a tablespoon of honey and I'm using a raw organic honey and then we're also going to add our drops so in order like I said to make it 168 milligrams total we're gonna put 6 droppers in and that's gonna give each one of our bars about 56 milligrams I'm gonna take about ten minutes for our chocolate to melt down so we'll let that melt and then we'll come back and put it in the mold so now that our chocolate is melted what we're gonna do is we're gonna scoop it into our chocolate bar molds that you can pick up at any of your craft stores or any of the online shops [Music] and then I normally scoop it all to one side in the middle first and then I'll spread it across to make sure that all the bars get filled up I'm not using anything fancy to spread it around it's just a plastic putty knife that works best for me that's the exact same size as the mold so now that our chocolate is done we're gonna give it a little bang to make sure there's no air bubbles in it and then we're gonna set it in the fridge or freezer to cool now that the chocolate bars have set in the freezer for 15 minutes what we're gonna do is we're just gonna bend the mold just to make sure that it's cracked and then we're gonna pop them out and they'll pop out easily there's one of our chocolate bars so we remember that our chocolate bars are about 56 milligrams each so that would make each half a chocolate bar 28 milligrams so we have our three chocolate bars these are keto friendly because they're unsweetened chocolate we've added our honey as their sweetener you can add different things if you want into the mold you can add dried berries nuts whatever suits your taste mint oil anything like that in order to make the flavor 100% yours it's chef Marcel signing off with cannabis wiki have a great day and make sure you check all

subscribe button and yeah enjoy the video hey guys what is going on today we're taking a look at another edible this time we're taking a look at a uh a rick and morty adventure bar now these are an obviously black market edward i don't think rick and morty would ever brand uh an actual edible and put their name well i guess they might they might but not probably not anytime soon uh so this is obviously black market somebody printed these out you know made the bar and packaged them uh there's probably multiple you might have something that looks very similar to this but uh the you know all this stuff might be different all the packaging might be different uh oh man my finger's been in the way that's embarrassing um this is strawberry shake flavor contains thc you got rick you got morty uh going in on going on an adventure for an adventure bar uh 300 milligrams this is most likely not accurate at all it could be way under or way over you have to be extremely careful with black market um edibles or just avoid them all together would be my advice um rick and morty adventure bar rick and morty adventure bark and morty adventure okay wow okay yep let's take a look at the back shall we warning contains 300 milligrams plus of thc not safe for kids and why would you why would you market it okay it's you know what whatever uh amount serving 2.4 pieces is a serving size that's a very weird serving size but if you want to listen to them or however you can adjust that to your own uh personal you know tolerance slash body weight slash how edibles affect you uh milk chocolate sugar milk chocolate cocoa butter lactose smoked fat soy lectin pgpr emulsifier vanillin and vanillin and vanillin artificial flavor i don't know what pgpr is but sounds good but i mean does not sound good but i'm also not a chef or a cook or a nutri nutritionist so i couldn't tell you anyway shall we bust this bad boy open a very good amount of this um this is what the strawberry milk strawberry shake looks like um i think it i think this edible it does look pretty good actually and it does taste good i've had chocolate bar edibles that are kind of gross and they do not taste like chocolate at all but this does taste like you know strawberry shake chocolate bar it's like pretty artificially flavored but it does look high quality it's a little bumpy there i don't know what the [ __ ] that is could be uh it could be anything uh i'm guessing a chunk of i don't know uh strawberry but it was white so maybe it's just a imperfection with the you know whoever made these goddamn things but they do get me feeling pretty nice i can't lie normally i just eat maybe two of them or three of them or i just split this one down the middle it's like one and a half um but yeah if you're uh in a place where this is your only option i guess not not that bad but if you were able to get stuff straight from the dispensary i would always recommend that and that is always better but uh yeah i got a ton of videos like this on my channel so if you like it subscribe and uh yeah stay safe everyone peace out", "38h5vfEs3Wk": "here's the problem with edibles they provide a notoriously unpredictable user experience you ask 10 people to describe the first time they ingested weed and I bet you most of them will tell you they made the classic mistake the beading too much one company working hard to solve this problem is an outfit out of Oakland California called defense a started by former Apple employees davon se specializes in fancy cannabis infused chocolate and they are some of the most user friendly edibles we have ever seen we made the product is accessible because for the most part people have had bad experiences with edibles and we want to change that so really paying attention to packaging pay attention to consistency of dosage but also making something that's delicious two things in particular caught our eye first thing was the graphic design it's tasteful and it's subtle you won't find pot leaves or any other imagery commonly associated with weed culture but what you will find are a clear indication of the bars THC content simple instructions and sensible dosing recommendations each bar contains 18 suggested servings of 10 milligrams of THC each if you're new to cannabis start with half a serving and look there's even a helpful diagram the second thing has to do with the shape of the chocolate bar segments you do easily because you know using a square and do things that other chocolate bars do all the time where they just puts a logo on each 18 servings that just didn't seem fun to us so we looked at you know just other ways of just adding dimension to the bar day fonts they decided to go with pyramid shape segments but it wasn't easy there are three different shapes in every 18 seconds our and davon say needed all of them to contain the same concentration of cannabis so they enlisted the help of a mathematician to ensure that all three shapes have the same volume that might seem like a minor detail but like every other aspect of this chocolate bars design it's a premium touch that actually adds to the experience those details add up and they're about to matter a lot more just a few months California and several other states will vote on whether to legalize weed for recreational use which means that a marketplace that's already flooded with options is going to become a lot more crowded it's this kind of attention to detail that's going to really set products apart", "qfdpEsrfu84": "[Music] give me a w w give me an e e give me an e e give me an A hey give me a t t give me an S s what does that spell wait sweet sweets hello everyone welcome to we it's the marijuana review show or we hope you guys make sense of your in dispensary classic classic review today we are taking a look at an edible and a brand I already know that I love quite a bit that is we are taking a look at our freshly legal review of Kiva Kiva their new 100 milligram a THC ginger dark chocolate bar with a hundred milligrams of CBD as well as you guys probably know if you tuned in often I'm not much of a CBD guy um but I am a THC guy so this one's a little bit more expensive than the standard Kiva because of the addition of the THC everything that cost me 25 bucks at night dispensary in Long Beach plus taxes so it's quite expensive but I hope it's going to taste as good as all other Eva products are and even most importantly I hope it's going to be as potent as Kiva has been now you can see the crazy packaging and has to go through this Kim in a sealed bag with a childproof seal and then this itself is in a childproof bag sealed and you always have to figure out how to open these and I can never figure out how to open them because I am NOT a smart person it's some point so we're gonna try to figure this out together you do this and that and then you pull away and then you say [ __ ] it and you get scissors that's how that's actually how it works you try what it says on the back and then used to get scissors and then surprise surprise on the inside is the exact same thing with all the pertinent information on it as well it's got lab tested results nutrition information all the good good stuff you want to see on it and that great Kiva minimalist card word packaging I really like their packaging design I'm outside of this unnecessary bag it's minimalist its well-designed and it does the job so I'm excited about this I like ginger like chocolate I'd loved every kiba flavor I've ever had and they've all got me a very very high so let's see if the tradition continues and here we go can't really smell anything just yet each piece contains five milligrams of THC so I guess this is gonna be twenty little squares or rectangles in there and there we are there are our 20 rectangles with some little design on it and oh it smells a lot like ginger that is a heavy ginger scent let's give it a taste it's like a symphony in my mouth and the conductor is weed it's good guys don't know matter that's what much else to tell you um except if you don't like ginger you are not gonna like this because this is heavy on the ginger flavor I happen to be pretty a fan ginger so I enjoyed this the chocolate itself is great quality there is a slight cannabis taste to it nothing overpowering nothing that's gonna make you throw up but if you hate the taste of cannabis maybe avoid but for me please punch mmm okay well I've been in there sixteen rectangles to get through but don't worry I'll finish off all of these and then once I finish off the last one I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling okay it'll probably be closer to three because I'm on my way to go see bad times at the El Royale is that the name the new Drew Goddard movie the guy did cabin in the woods excited about that so I'll cut you guys after the movie and I'll let you know how this kiba there are a lot of pieces of packaging here key the ginger dark chocolate bar is hitting thanks for watching weeds guys and I'll see you in just a bit and welcome back to weeds it has been about two hours 45 minutes and change since I last seen you guys and I come back to you surprisingly conflicted about the kiva ginger dark chocolate bar if you will look at my eyes they will tell you I am quite high and I do feel very relaxed very at ease very peaceful however I don't want to say I feel high per se I feel just sort of more easygoing and more relaxed and I might be confusing this I might this might just be a total placebo a factor I've sort of gotten into my own head and the confirmation bias type thing um I have heard however that's for some people CBD counter affects the psychoactive properties of THC and this can make you feel the CBD sort of effects and you know the more relaxing effects of THC as well but not this sort of more whoa man kind of high aspects and I think that might be what happened to me here ah for some people that's gonna be great that is going to be a jackpot that's gonna be exactly what they want for me it's not what I was looking for I was really hoping for more of a the classic head-high experience especially seeing the movie I just got out of Drew Goddard bad times at Hotel at the El Royale something like that I can't remember all those nouns so I was hoping to be really high for that movie because Drew Goddard likes to spend some crazy yarns and said I was just really chilled out and and you know I was a little disappointed unfortunately this is not gonna be the Kiva for me however I am NOT gonna give it a disapproval or I'm not gonna give it the thumbs down because I think for this a certain customer one who perforce prefers the more gist chilled out relaxed style of weed might really love this for me however it's just not exactly what I was looking for not what I was hoping for but that is not Kiva's fault I I knew that that was a possibility going in so just wanted to give you guys that heads-up that the CBD seems to be pretty effective in here so if you love CBD and THC maybe give this one a shot if you are like me and like the sort of Moorhead high this sort of more psychedelic sort of side of I wanna you'll want to stick with the traditional Kiva's which I have no problem recommending wholeheartedly so this one is a little bit mixed for me unfortunately but again that is not not an endorsement or not telling you to avoid it so I'm going to before I bounce here though guys I want to share with you a little cherry on top something that I do not have mixed feelings over and that is another Drew Goddard movie because I did have some similarly mixed feelings to this key lebar about bad times at hotel Royale something elroy out whatever the name of the movie is but his second movie I think cabin in the woods from 2012 is a fantastic movie I'm sure you've probably seen it and I'm sure somebody if you haven't has spoiled it for you but if not check it out it is an utter utter riot one of the most inventive movies and years just an absolute blast love that movie two thumbs up for Drew Goddard cabin in the woods one thumb up one kind of half cocked for the hotel Royale and about the sort of same for that keepa bar I think that sort of sums it all up I'm still pretty high just not the same high I wanted to be and that's gonna do it for real this time thank you so much for watching weeds guys and we will see you guys on the next review peace", "prr6FLa61jk": "my name is Bob mosquito I'm co-founder and president of company called medically correct and we do a line of infused edibles in Colorado called Incredibles they also do a line of award-winning extracts called incredible extracts and we also manufacture closed-loop extraction equipment under incredible extractor brand right now we're known for our chocolate we are the largest he said edibles manufacture in in Colorado we produce five to seven thousand bars a day you know these two machines behind us we're running 70 to 80 pounds of product through these machines every day in Colorado when we started six years ago inconsistency was the biggest problem in the edibles industry and nobody was really testing products nobody was accurately dosing products we saw that as a big opportunity not only to set ourselves apart but to do what was right for the patients people didn't really like edibles because they were afraid of them you could have an edible one day and you'd be medicated fine you'd have the same edible from the same company the following week and you'd be over medicated that was the biggest concern that we saw and you know my partner Rick his expertise was perfecting a recipe and duplicating at 20,000 times a day when I approached him and talked to him about doing edibles that we treated like food you know professionally packaged nutritional labels consistency those were the three main things that weren't happening in Colorado at the time so we saw that really as something that the industry needs you", "4lBu59N17Vs": "recreational marijuana edibles coming to a store near you as of now you can make them at home but it is illegal for anyone to buy and/or sell them to the public Canada's proposed edible pot regulations have been made public and the 60-day consultation process has come to an end under the proposed federal rules a single serving would be limited to 10 milligrams of THC the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis and each serving must be individually wrapped this is considered a low to moderate dose of THC this dosage limit is sugar than in Colorado Washington or California where multiple servings are allowed per package so for example in a chocolate bar each breakable square can contain 10 milligrams each for a total of 100 milligrams pot meant for ingestion cannot have alcohol have limited caffeine and come in a plain child-resistant package the draft regulations say the products must not be appealing to youth and the packaging can't advertise dessert or confectionery flavors so no gummies shaped like bears one of the problems which were legalizing edibles were kids so kids came into the kitchen saw this wonderful nicely colored marijuana edibles and as kids to try it out the proposed rules are an attempt to address one of the main issues with edibles making sure they don't cause risk to public health especially for those who are underage but some are worried the black market will continue to thrive which are strict regulations a major cannabis edibles manufacturing California says it's been difficult to navigate within the legal market because there's still so much competition in the illicit market people that are heavy consumers of cannabis and like to ingest it can ingest you know hundreds if not thousands of milligrams of THC in a day and so if they have products that are available in the illicit market that are much cheaper and have a much higher potency they're gonna tend to go towards that so a problem with edible marijuana is that people are not used to it with edibles the effects can later and the people's oh I have now done this edible marijuana and there feel nothing and they'd more and more to avoid putting people at risk it would be better to start with low dosage and once we have clear evidence the black market is still thriving then we can reevaluate Health Canada confirms they've received 7,000 responses from Canadians industry representatives the provinces and the public health community on the proposed

certain time when it's overly dry it's too bad it's too late it's already dry that's why i just like cooking my fill got this wonderful looking pizza out of the oven this cannabis pizza i'm gonna let it cool down first i'm gonna take y'all through every bit of uh tasting this with me we're gonna slice it up together and uh do a taste test and review this thing right now all right let's let it cool

thanks so much for joining me", "AYd0hsg5xwQ": "[Music] howdy duty folks welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful handsome attractive and interesting folks make sense of your crazy wonderful mixed up scary anxiety inducing what the hell quite is this place known as your local dispensary so today we are taking a look at a product that has been uh or a category of products rather that has been kind of up and down in my estimation i find some i really like and find a lot of duds and that is the capsule category uh we are taking a look at buddies today oh boy that uh has quite the reflection buddies soft gels one thousand one thousand one thousand one thousand one thousand one thousand milligrams of thc of course we're not doing on 1 000 like all of our wheats reviews we aim to do 100 milligrams of the thc and review that much of it but a thousand milligrams is quite the uh achievement uh especially for as few as there are there are actually only 20 soft gels in here uh leading to 50 milligrams a capsule if you know you are very simple multiplication um really really excited about this one uh if i can find oh my dog is growling at another dog here she's being kind of a [ __ ] underneath so um so these are as i said very very very strong for a single capsule i'm kind of interested to see what they look like 50 milligrams in a single capsule to me seems very [Music] uh at the limits of what can be done but i don't know you know maybe they figured out some kind of magic um so uh on this buddies package here we've got all our incredible information we want we've even got nutrition facts so one of these soft gels has 6.61 calories in case you want to get that specific 6.61 calories 0.73 grams of fat um so this is a gelatin uh oh it's a glycerin base grapeseed oil uh so it has both some kind of like gelatin glycerin which is some kind of um often glycerin is often used vegetable glycerin is often used uh when making like tinctures uh and then grape seed oil is apparently what they are using uh as their um uh base instead of the more common sort of mct oil you see i don't see grape seed oil very often so 50 milligrams we are gonna do two of these capsules uh and just to ensure that i'm gonna get the best effect i am after i take these capsules going to uh eat some food with a lot of fat content in it just to be sure it gets in the bloodstream in the most uh effective way possible uh and then the other big thing to know about these capsules is their surprising affordability uh buddies i've seen they have quite a few products i've seen um carts from them uh they are sort of partnered with packs i've seen pax pods uh and now of course these um soft gels uh and they're always quite affordable uh these soft gels are no exception soft gels are usually quite expensive um for example like the gold cap which was it used to be a big brand a thousand milligrams of this would have cost you uh well over a hundred bucks uh these were a scant forty eight dollars for a hundred or excuse me a thousand milligram uh capsules a hell of a good deal especially if they are as strong as advertised and then last thing i'll bring up is the lab test results they're on the side um so they do you know show that these have 50.7 milligrams of thc as uh denoted by their lab testings and then of course they give you all the other great manufacturing information on it uh and well let's go ahead and open it up take a look at our very shockingly small soft gels for something that's going to have 50.7 milligrams of thc supposedly there it is um nice looking oil actually a super consistent handsome little tablet capsule soft gel let's get that nomenclature correct so here is apparently 100 milligrams of thc uh i cannot wait to be impressed forgot to bring a beverage with me so you know what just gonna have to dry swallow down the hatch well there we go that's 100 excuse me 101.4 milligrams of thc according to their lab testing results so i'm really interested to see how these are going to fare uh that's going to take me and our custom review wheats review process two hours to find out i'm gonna uh chill out here hope to get quite high as i said eat some nice high fat meal and then two hours from now i'm gonna come right back to you guys here and say hopefully i'm super high well for that we'll all have to find out together see you guys right back here in just a bit [Music] my buddies my buddies my buddies and me i'm pretty sure that was the name of a child's toy from the 80s my buddy it's probably the inspiration for chucky what's not the inspiration for chucky is buddies 1 000 milligram soft gels or in our case one tenth of that 100 milligrams of buddies soft gels um and uh that's where the beginning and end of the similarities to chucky are um in every other way it's distinctively non-chucky-like um it never gets married it doesn't have children it doesn't break the fourth wall um buddies why were we talking about chutty chutties chuckies buddies they're pretty good 100 milligrams um of these uh i wouldn't say it's quite as strong as a um good solid baked edible but i'm not gonna complain that much either um that is the smallest footprint of a thousand mil or excuse me 100 milligrams i think i've ever taken uh and i am uh pleasantly quite high again for something that was so miniscule um and i have nine whole doses left in here uh equivalent size to doses all for uh that very affordable 48 bucks like you're not gonna you know um you're not gonna find ten edibles for that price so that's uh that's a pretty good uh gonna be a pretty good endorsement from me it's not the strongest hundred milligrams i've ever had uh but i am always always looking for things that are going to um pack uh sort of out i'll punch their weight class uh and these tiny again these things are so small uh that is 50 milligrams of thc right there dropped one better not let the dog get that um and uh so yeah very very happy with buddies looking forward to doing uh another nine rounds with them in fact um so i'm gonna give it you know what i'll just go ahead and give it two thumbs up of buddies their thc thousand milligram thought soft gels not the best hundred milligrams i've ever done but again a hell of a value and a tiny little footprint uh so before i go with you guys i mean anytime we do the big old siskel and ebert two thumbs upper uh we want to go and mix our metaphors even further so we want to go ahead and add a little cherry on top some you can sort of mole over think about enjoy watch process during your busy boring days um that is the coronavirus uh you know that you can do with or without weed and this week i want to leave you uh with one of the things that i love hearing the most and um uh and and it can be a bomb for our uh anxious times and that is the phrase uh this x can be a salve for these scary times um just pay attention and anytime there's something that isn't uh people are talking about that isn't scary or is vaguely pleasant you'll hear somebody in inevitably describe it as a bomb or a salve for these anxious scary trying boring uh you know pick your adjective times uh and uh then you get really irritated with it quite quickly so my cherry on top is uh my observation that you're gonna notice people saying an x for y a lot uh that x being a bomb or a south things people never use any other time um so why that seems so uh pertinent now i don't know what also isn't pertinent is this review of buddies thousand milligrams which we did a hundred of thumbs up also thumbs up this phrase which is um a a tincture for our a highly uh friction something something world um i failed to come up with another one wow this went on for a while buddies really great boy this one off the rails in the best way possible thank you so much for watching it's been great stay high stay healthy really do stay healthy and we'll see you guys on a later review also stay high goodbye", "nxqDA2gOybg": "let's talk about weed baby let's talk\nabout you and me let's talk about all the THC all the CBD that baby gets us high\nhi welcome back to the busy budtender I am the busy budtender the girl who\nsometimes likes to smoke weed online but also likes to educate you about cannabis\ncannabis lifestyle and how to integrate it into your world if you're interested in\nmore and learning about cannabis cannabis products in cannabis lifestyle\ndefinitely make sure to subscribe like this video hit the bell do it ever you'd\nlike to do to make sure you don't miss any of my videos without further ado\nthough let's take a look at the product that I'm actually gonna be talking about\nin today's video which I'm assuming is why you clicked it is the chowie wowie milk\nchocolate edibles as per usual with my reviews the first thing I want to look\nat is the brand and the licensed producer who actually makes the product\nthen moving into the product attributes unboxing my own tasting trying of the\nproduct itself and then finally my own recommendations and opinions so make sure\nyou stick around to the end to find out what I actually think about this product so chowie wowie the brand that we're looking\nat today who actually makes it chowie wowie is owned by a company called High\nPark which I recently spoke about in one of my videos they're based in Toronto a\nbig company that owns a lot of different brands and then above high park is of\ncourse tilray the big multinational corporation now Tilray as a licensed\nproducer my own opinion not my favorite licensed producer, not\nmy not favorite I don't really have any strong opinions on tilray yet I do\nknow that they're in multiple markets which is pretty cool cuz I'm always down\nfor bringing cannabis to more people but aside from that I really don't have any\nstrong opinions about tilray if you want to learn a little bit more about tilray\nor their brands I recently did a review about Canaca which is another one of the\nbrands that high park tilray owns which I pretty much enjoyed if you want to\ncheck out that video of course the links are gonna be wherever the heck I put\nthem so definitely check that out if you're interested\nso as for chowie wowie as a brand specifically chowie wowie exclusively does\nedibles so they don't do any dried flower no vapes but they do have two\ndifferent types of milk chocolates and some gummies today though we're gonna be\nlooking at the chowie wowie milk chocolate balance between 10 milligrams of CBD and\n10 milligrams of THC if you guys aren't familiar with the\ndifferences between THC and CBD they're pretty interesting\nyou're not like big cannabis nerds like me but THC is the stuff that makes\nyou high it's the thing that makes you uplift it it's the thing that you feel\nin your head and in your brain and does a lot of fun things for you\nCBD on the other hand is the more well on this side to the cannabis industry\nit's really good for inflammation and the really interesting thing that I\nwanted to talk about specifically with this product and CBD is that CBD is\nknown to counteract some of the effects of THC so THC sometimes can make\nyou feel anxious or paranoid or also in general just increases your heart rate\nCBD kind of like pulls the crank a little bit back which is why this\nproduct will be pretty interesting to try so in comparison with their other\nproduct which is a 10 milligram of THC exclusively I would likely expect a\nlittle bit more of an intense high rather than this one which is going to\nbe a little bit more balanced you can get the chowie wowie milk chocolate edibles\non the OCS which is Ontario's cannabis store for seven dollars and 20 cents so\nit's pretty affordable if you want to just try out some edibles it's not a\nit's seven dollars as for the packaging itself before I open this up I think\nit's pretty cute I I think chowie wowie's doing a decent job with the restrictions\nthey have with packaging in Canada that being said I don't see like a recycling\nsign on this so I'm not sure if this can be put in your curbside recycling\nprogram the alternative is I'm pretty sure that with every piece of cannabis\npackaging including stuff like this you can return it to stores that have\nrecycling programs but I'm not really quite sure about like specifically this\ntype of packaging I don't know I'm I'm a sucker for sustainability so\nit kind of sucks to buy cannabis and this kind of packaging but I'll talk a\nlittle bit more about the quantity of this product and the packaging a little\nbit later in the video anyways enough about that let's actually open this up\nand see what it looks like and smell it all right so let's get into the unboxing\non the front of the package we have our cute little chowie wowie logo milk chocolate big ass THC thing and then the total amount of THC\nand CBD which again is balanced at 10 milligrams and 10 milligrams and our big\nwarning about how it can take up to four hours to feel the full effects from\neating or drinking cannabis on the back we have our beautiful excise stamp\nwhich is the Alberta one because I'm currently in Alberta and then I actually\nreally like this on the back they wrote these balance chocolates are made with\n10 milligrams of THC and 10 milligrams of CBD per piece each piece can be\neasily split into two squares to enjoy with friends I guess friend\nwe've recommend starting with just one square then waiting to feel the effects\nbefore having more while you wait you can invent backstories for strangers try\nnot to think about capybaras watch clouds done I think that's cute\nobviously cuz it's an edible this is unfortunately not a zero calorie product\nit has 80 calories per container and then you have all of the important\nnutrition facts over here the packaged on date is late December so December\n17th so right before edibles were actually released in Canada so it's not\nto to old and of course the ingredients which it just looks like it's kind of a\nmediocre chocolate with whole milk powder and blah blah blah whatever and\non cannabis extraction of course anyways enough about that let's actually see how\ndifficult this is to open all right and then normally with these\nkind of products you can see it's like a zip a zip lock issue thing close a zip\nlock type of closure so with these I'm pretty sure you're supposed to like yeah\nOh first try baby did you guys see that oh yeah you're supposed to twist it I\ndon't let's check this puppy out cute the interesting thing that I noticed\nwhen I was unboxing this is that it doesn't say anywhere on the packaging\nwhat type of strain the extracts have come from whether it's a indica sativa\nor hybrid according to sources online this is supposed to be a hybrid strain\nso something in between which is my favorite type of strain but it's pretty\nweird they wouldn't put it on the packaging anyways aside from that when\nyou open it up firstly as for the smell I'd say it smells like 80% chocolate 20%\nweed which isn't bad at all it does have a very slight dankness to it but it's\nnot overpowering and then as you can see from the unboxing it comes in these two\ncute little squares sorry cute little rectangles that you could split it with\na friend and then the chowie wowie thing on the front let me talk a little bit about\ndosing edibles and how they're different for everybody\nof course we as we metabolize and consume alcohol differently 3 beers is\ngonna be something extremely different than 3 beers is for someone of a\ncompletely different weight and height the same thing kind of goes with\ncannabis and edibles so what everyone recommends is to start low and go slow\nso with something like this where you have 10 milligrams\nit's recommended that you take ok let me see if I can break this open it's\nrecommended that you eat one of these wait like 2 hours I'd say before you\nhave any more as for me I'm actually gonna be taking both of these because\nnumber one my tolerance is probably a little bit heavier than that of most\npeople consider I consume a lot of cannabis throughout my weekly day-to-day\netc and also because I want to show you guys what taking both of these would be\nlike whether you're someone who has a higher tolerance like me or you're just\ncurious as to what that kind of experience is and if you're a beginner\nconsumer or have a lower tolerance in general my somewhat assumption is that\nmy experience taking both of these is going to be somewhat similar to what it\nwould be like are you taking just one alright let's\ntry it out hmm it tastes like like a Hershey's\nchocolate or like any other kind of cheaper but fine chocolate and then it\nhas like that dink aftertaste II presence it's not bad like I'm not like\ndisgusted like it's fine I think I'm just a snob when it comes to food and I\nwant us to taste good the flavors not bad it's really really not bad once you\neat more you can't taste the cannabis as much as just very much chocolate so\nmaybe that helps all right bottoms up and now we wait while I'm sitting here\nfor the next two hours and waiting for my edibles to kick in so I can give you\nguys the full spectrum of opinions that I always do have I do want to talk a\nlittle bit about cannabis 2.0 and how Canada made some mistakes in my opinion\nand maybe you guys can agree with me or let me know what you think in the\ncomments down below if you guys are edibles people if you enjoy the cannabis\n2.0 products in general what you think about the rules and regulations I'd love\nto know down below specifically what I'm talking about is this package which is\nthe 10 milligrams of THC 10 milligram CBD that is the highest legal amount\nthat you can have in a cannabis package in Canada in the legal market\nspecifically what I mean is the ten milligrams of CBD and THC in an edible\nproduct is the maximum amount in a package in Canada the reason I think\nthis is kind of bullshit is not only because of course I come from a\nbackground of experiences on the black market and when you purchase black\nmarket edibles it comes in a package roughly the same size but it's gonna be\na hundred milligrams or even 200 milligrams or more that being said it\ndoesn't mean that you should take a hundred milligrams of cannabis or 200\nmilligrams of a cannabis edible unless you want to do that what it means is\nthat you have multiple gummies or multiple pieces of chocolate that are\nbroken down into 20 or 10 milligram pieces or five milligram pieces and then\nas long as you have the information that you're giving the consumer that hey\ndon't eat this whole frickin package they're gonna be okay I think it's\npretty ridiculous that the government feels like they need to babysit\nconsumers in making such tiny packages for edibles it's it's like buying one\nbeer you don't want to buy one beer want to buy a 6-pack or you want to buy\na bottle of Smirnoff and it's not like and it's not like the government\nrestricts the amount of Smirnoff because they don't trust the consumers it's that\nthere's enough education and in society to know that you're not supposed to\ndrink a bottle of Smirnoff unless you're pretty wild the same thing goes with\nedibles I personally am under the belief that\nnot only would it be more sustainable in that this type of packaging could have\nway more uses to it rather than just a single time use for someone like me\nbut in addition yeah it just doesn't make sense it does make sense to have\nsuch a small package if you want to share a bunch of beers with friends you\ndon't bring one beer and then split it into small cups you bring a six-pack in\nthe cannabis realm in Canada you can't bring a six-pack and I just I don't know\nI think that the Canadian government is really really handicapping itself with\ncannabis 2.0 I hope that things will change in the future\nbut those are just my thoughts and opinions again I love to know yours I'm\ngonna get comfy I got my switch I got my animal crossing and I can tell you guys\nupdates as they come... guys look it's me I don't wear glasses in real life but\nI thought it looked cute this is my house tell me it's not just like a chill vibe\nI like it so update number one as you can see\nKingdom Hearts is playing in the background because I'm at my parents\nhouse and I thought why not be 14 again anyway so at the 15-minute mark what I'm\nstarting to feel is I'm definitely started to feeling something in my head\nand then I'm not sure if I was just hungry or a spurt of the edibles\nmunchies kicked in but I had a couple pretzels and I'm feeling a lot better so\nstay tuned for how the rest of this goes welcome to the 30 minute ish checkpoint I\nam definitely feeling quite baked and having a really really fun time I'm\nfeeling really uplifted my heart rate is a little bit fast but it's not too bad\nyeah I'm having a really good time honestly that's pretty much it but I'm\ndefinitely feeling a very very strong high at 30 minutes which is pretty good\nbecause a lot of times with the edibles that I make it sometimes at home or have\nhad in the past it can take like an hour or longer than that to feel the effect\nso feeling under 30 minutes is quite enjoyable\nthe downside of it is I do have some dry mouth which is like fine\nand I've been a little bit hungry but other than that I think this is a really\nreally fun time hello and welcome back it has been roughly three and a half\nhours since I last sat down here specifically and was talking with you\nguys I just wanted to tell you my entire experience what I think and my star\nrating so I personally really really enjoyed it I will say if you're an early\nuser do not take two of like don't eat the whole thing because that's probably\ngonna be too much for you but for me it was like a great time I really really\nenjoyed it I thought that the high was very uplifting very fun at times I felt\nlike my heart rate was a little bit high but that just might have been me and\nthat's not necessarily because of the strain and aside from being uplifted I\nwas also feeling quite chill so like a mix between it was a hybrid essentially\nwith the CBD I do feel a very nice body relaxing\nfeeling my body feels like I just did a nice hour-long yoga session with like a\n15 minute shavasana at the end which if you don't know what that means it means\nlike taking a nap after yoga essentially so it feels like I took a nice nap but\nI'm still feeling quite uplifted with the hybrid-ness of the strain so the\npros and the cons of the chowie wowie is in my opinion the negative side is that\nfrankly I don't think there's enough of the product in here because I think that\nit's actually pretty good and then on the positive side I think that the high\nwas really enjoyable and fun especially with the THC and CBD aspects to what I\nfeel like I almost come out of here feeling better than I was before yeah\nthat's it it's a pretty solid product so what\nwould I actually pair this with if you're gonna watch something well I'm\ngonna say that because for me the high was a little bit more intense with the\nentire chocolate bar chocolate Square whatever is I would watch something that\nI've already seen before so for me that would be like as series like Gilmore\nGirls or maybe community or if you wanted\nsomething new something like haikyuu is what I would be watching right now so I\nthink that kind of chill TV show that you've already seen or maybe are okay\nwith seeing and that being said something that's still gonna be\nuplifting to encourage that part of the strain I think would be perfect\nso what star rating should I give this mmm I'd say a 3.75 am I allowed to do\nthat it's my channel to do that I'm going to give this a 3.75\nout of 5 the reason I'm gonna give it a 3.75 and\nnot four is because I'm like it's good like I really enjoyed it and like the\nprice points pretty chill but it's not like incredible and I think as of right\nnow the industry frankly only has things that are around the four star mark for\nlike their top I'm hoping that in the future in the next year or so can it'll\nbe able to push it a little bit and give us some five star products but for now\nwe're gonna aim for four stars so that's why I give this a 3.75 anyways that is\nall for me thank you guys for joining me on today's review and let me know have\nyou

"jFcWBeILpxU": "hello and welcome to episode 14 of the ganja geezer today is another review day and I'm going to be following up on my latest shopping trip and we're gonna be reviewing dr. J's hash infused star bars white chocolate and cranberries and take the stuff from the giving tree a few days ago this is a company dr. J's hash infused edibles as usual I'll always include the website URL down below the ingredients are sugar cocoa butter dried whole milk soy lecithin added as a multiplier natural vanilla flavor cranberries and hash infusion oil now from their website it says that this is a cold water extraction hash versus a ethanol or butane hash they also make a big deal no preservatives or artificial ingredients of any kind in this product also on the back a lot of information which at the bottom includes the lot number and a very clear expiration date which I like so overall a very professional package and it was $13 and there is two hundred and fifty milligrams of active hash oil in this product so let's cut this thing open I got some scissors here now the bar itself is wrapped it looks like it's some foil yeah it's just straightforward tin foil and it's just a little brick Oh chocolate with some red reddish flecks in there which I'm assuming is um the cranberry if there's anything else I should be concerned so 250 milligrams here so maybe a sixth or a seventh of this is what I'm going to consume I have a knife here I'm going to carve off a little chunk that's gonna be easier said than done this is very hard flaky you know that's not working well well so there's a problem right there for me is that you just kind of broke up and fell apart so you can see here I don't know if I can show this just kind of fell apart into little flakes the chunk that I'm going to eat which I think's about 1/6 or 1/7 of it yeah I don't know I mean I'm my EverQuest for my quest for non weedy tasting edibles is still at a search very strong taste again the concentration of this doesn't surprise me alright I can taste the white chocolate in there got a little bit of the cranberry but huge strong cannabis some aftertaste well apart from that as you can see here carved off a little chunk off the corner that maybe not enough but I'm really not gonna take a risk of something with as much we just concentrated a dose so I'm going to sign off for now and tomorrow I will let you know the other three factors in my rating pain relief side effects and the both discussed the cost for a milligram ratio detail then the die is a medicated [Music] well I'm back for the review of the dr. J's white chocolate and cranberry star bars that I took last night and let's start with recap of the taste one word for that is bread very very strong cannabis taste when eating white chocolate you one would expect a very one very sweet rich treat with cranberries in there you know a really tasty kind of chocolate bar it's what you expect and all you get is really just weed weed weed weed kind of almost a cognitive dissonance in my head you know you expect one flavor and you get a very strong flavor not a pleasant one instead so show you how much I took here I just took a little chunk off the corner there maybe a sixth of a bar maybe a little less and you can't really tell the color and the lighting in here but there's almost a light greenish color in here so you know there's a very strong concentration of hash and fusion in here and when I'm taste alone I would give this a five because it's maybe even less but it's just bad but I'm giving it a modifier of adding two because of the high concentration of Medicine the 250 milligrams that's in this small little block so I'm going to bump that rating up to 7 to be fair because it is highly concentrated so for taste a final Taif final rating of seven now going into pain relief as you saw I only took a sixth of a bar for a dose and I got minor to middling pain relief you know it was still there but and also it took almost two hours for it to peak and it was a minor peak at best I'm thinking maybe a fifth of a bar or maybe a little more would be a better dosage that effects were minimal so that was a good thing overall taking the small dose into account I'm giving this a seven for pain relief as well as taste so 747 for pain side effects minimal minimal light head effects and easily manageable very easy no couch lock whatsoever so content a king and its out this light dose I'm giving that a nine for side-effects I was perfectly manageable I went out did anything I wanted to do except drive so again nine for side-effects now value no this is where this thing really shines if you look at it from the milligram two-dollar ratio I use you have 250 milligrams for thirteen dollars in the bar that gives you a milligram $2 ratio of 19 rounded down which is very high in fact it's the highest I've gotten so far so I'm giving that a nine as well not a 10 because the effects were so mild compared to other reviewed products like for example the mile-high mint chocolate bar I reviewed last month so in summary 7 for taste a 7 for pain relief a 9 for side effects or the lack thereof and a 9 for value gives you a 32 divided by 4 gives you an overall ganja gita geezer rating of 8 ok so a little aside here so this is an 8 a nice little bar very concentrated medicine 250 milligrams so my quest for an actual palatable treat is still ongoing any feedback for many of you in Colorado proving to me a treat can be made truly palatable but it would be very welcome I plan on heading over to a place in Denver called the ganja gourmet in the near future to see what they have to offer I'm thinking the dose that that you need needs to be added to a larger meal to dilute the ganja funk well that's it for now

recipe and start to finish without infusing your treat I'll make sure I specifically show you how to infuse and then if you choose not to no worries they're your treats after all anyways without further ado let's get baking those green magic bars so the first thing we're going to do is we're gonna take our Oreo we're going to open it right up and we're going to take out the inside now you're gonna take your Oreos you stick them in your blender magic bullet whatever you have it's really anything that blade will work and we're gonna repeat this until your magic bullet is kind of about a quarter of the way through we're gonna be making about a cup and a half of ground Oreo crumbs and you're gonna put your Oreo filling to the side once you've got enough Oreos in here you're gonna crush them up using a magic bullet or whatever blender you have just until they are a very very fine crumb [Music] you're in separate Royals grind them up until you end up with about cup and a half to two cups of Oreos next thing you gonna do is you're gonna take your coconut oil and you're gonna add it into the crumbs of the Oreo we have about half a cup of coconut oil here and we're gonna add in also a little bit of brown sugar mix it all together essentially just gonna mix it until it becomes sticky where I get my hands dirty you'll know it's good once it kind of comes together clumps together like this once you've got your Oreo crust into a sticky ball like sort of texture you're going to grab a 9 by 9 inch pan lined with parchment paper and you're gonna take all of your Oreo from and you're gonna put it right in and I'm gonna use my spatula and I'm gonna press it down so now's the point where we would infuse the treats I'm going to infuse the crust now normally when you're baking with an infused cannabis butter or oil you would put it in with a baked good mix it up really well add some soy lecithin in this case because the oil might not necessarily be a hundred percent properly dispersed in a crust we're actually going to use an eyedropper and we're going to dose it based on the number of squares that we're going to cut out of this bar so the oil that I'm using today I infused to be ten milligrams of THC to four grams of coconut oil an important number and that calculation you need to have because now I know that I have to put four grams of coconut oil per square that I'm making to show that I'm going to actually divide this into nine bars right now I'm going to then take my melted coconut Kanna butter and I'm going to drop four grams into each I know that four grams of this oil is ten droppers full of his-- so I'm gonna drop it in now that our bars have been infused they ready to go let's finish this off we're going to dump a full bag of desiccated unsweetened coconut right on top read it right out to the corners then we're gonna top it off with some vegan Belgian dark chocolate and for people like me who like nuts we're gonna top it off with some walnuts you can omit this you can also add whatever else you want in this place use pecans you can use pretzels you can use really anything that's crunchy you can use nothing at all totally your choice and for the final piece the piece that sticks it all together we're gonna throw in some coconut condensed milk don't worry about it being loopy or kind of sticky on the top it will sink in it will bake in and once it's been spread out it's time to put this bad boy into the oven you're gonna bake it at 350 degrees for 45 to 50 minutes you'll know it's done when the top is golden brown looks a little crispy and everything looks dark but not on the verge of burn all right so our wonderful green dream magic bars have come out of the oven here absolutely gorgeous super caramelized you can notice around the edges they're kind of on the brown side borderline holes for it without the perfect amount of caramelization especially for the middle to make sure it's fully cooked all the way through the last bit to add a little bit of pizzazz is we're gonna take all those Oreo middles that we saved add a little bit of water to it you can also add a non-dairy milk your choice I'm gonna whisk it up and then we're gonna throw it in this piping bag and drizzle it right on the top it's gonna be amazing we're gonna now cut these bars to get them out of the pan if you want to take the whole thing out of the pan I highly suggest you freeze it before we try taking it out cuz it'll be very tricky to get out but it is easier if you just cut them into bars before you go remember when you're cutting your bars to cut them based off of the doses you needed before so we said nine squares so we're gonna cut about where's and that's it ladies and gents this is how easy it is to make a delicious dream bar which can also be a in green bar totally up to you if you want to learn more about how to safely use and eat cannabis in your baked goods or food make sure you check out our youtube channel or dolled up desserts comm for really simple tips and tricks on how to get it right and make sure you're infusing safely and properly now if you'll excuse me I'm gonna sample a little one of these guys right now cheers guys so good thanks so much for watching guys [Music]", "5q32fPb7C5s": "we are going to test it for potency and see if indeed it passes my research has focused on cannabis infused chocolates specifically relating to trends in the sample prep and how it relates to the potency readings that we record I would say the takeaway is that the presence of chocolate in the vial can interfere with our ability to accurately test the amount of THC in that product and that can be a negative for the consumer and for the producer the chocolate bar might in reality have more cannabinoids than the lab finds and thus the product might actually be overdosed when it gets to the consumers hands there is a possibility that the customer might feel too high but on the whole the actual effect is probably not enough that it would make the difference between somebody having a good experience or needing to go to the emergency room I don't think that this causes a substantial health risk to consumers but I do think that it might affect their confidence they have in the legal market and thus this science is important to establish the scientific legitimacy of the cannabis industry in its nascent days I think it will bring confidence to the to the whole industry because we're starting to learn more about what's really going on and now we're testing chocolate the right way to get the right values out of the matrix so I'm more optimistic than pessimistic about it", "o3fYypXjEeM": "hi buds it's candy here today I'm going to be making THC infused strawberry lemonade that I made with distillate so I'm going to be a hundred percent honest with you I'm leaving a timestamp here so you guys can go straight to the recipe because I've made this way more complicated than I needed to be and basically this video you're gonna watch me turn a mistake into something magical I can start feeling the heaviness right now Dex first things first you're going to need a gram of distillate roughly it does all the grams and I'll be talking more about it later on two cups of sugar 1 cup of Everclear this recipe calls for a two-to-one ratio and we're using Everclear to dissolve the distillate that Everclear is something you could potentially skip next we need roughly two cups of half strawberries as well as one and a half cup of fresh squeezed lemons next you want to preheat the oven at 200 degrees and leave it at 200 degrees so that where we don't activate the THC and I honestly just so it you don't need to activate the TFC because it's already there so we just want to make sure we conserve as much as possible next get the 2 cups of sugar and put it into a pan then get the 1 cup of Everclear important to a bowl now we're going to be putting that one gram of distillate into the so that we can start mixing this distillate roughly houses around a thousand milligrams of THC in it the reason I wanted to put it and Everclear was so that it would dissolve evenly and that way I could put it evenly throughout the sugar my original plan was to make granulated sugar about what I did was I messed up and I closed the oven door and then it turned into a syrup so then I decided to work with what I had but yes I will be making an actual tutorial on how to do the guy kneeling sugar now we just mix the Everclear and the distillate together next you pour the mixture onto the sugar you could use a little bit of a wider pan than we did then we mixed it all together and make sure that everything is saturated evenly next just place to the 200 degree preheated oven and set your timer for 13 minutes and check for daily and this is where I messed up my original plan I did close the other door so it did cook down and it created an actual cistern so if you do want to make granular sugar you simply just leave the oven door open so that way it can all evaporated but then you get this golden to cool this is where the real recipe begins you simply boil two cups water and keep it on a very low simmer because you do not want to activate the THC and then I poured the syrup that I created into the water just to dilute it a little bit now here I'm going to be placing the actual instructions on how you can make it a lot easier and save the headaches basically ideally you would just put the two cups of water melt two cups of sugar into it and then add a distillate right on it I actually enjoyed several clearer taste to it it had a little bit of a move to the lemonade so I didn't mind it now it's time for the lemonade start cutting an equivalent of two cups of hats strawberries put them into a little bowl and then start mashing away you could certainly use a blender but according to my friend he doesn't believe in them use this now it's time to roll some lemons and get the juices flowing and start to squeeze the lemon juice in there I did get a roughly an equivalent of a cup and a half of lemon juice it could certainly be anything ever they want and then I add the mashed and pureed strawberry onto it I actually enjoyed the masher because it left Jack pretty pulpy give it a good stir and then we're ready to add the syrup we created put it in along with two cups of water and that's pretty much it after giving it a good little stir simply serve in chilled glasses and enjoy I really enjoyed making this granted it was a headache and a half just because of a failed experiment but you can always turn something negative into a positive and definitely this was a positive hope you guys enjoy it as we did and I'll see you guys later we're gonna feel it slowly I'm happy you", "MDhTGsHZs3E": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to weeks the marijuana edible reviews show where we help you make sense of your dispensary help you determine which edibles are worth your hard-earned dollars and decode all of those crazy crazy packages at your dispensary today we are looking at a smaller product we are looking at calli gold the chocolate bar calli gold the sour diesel variant 125 milligrams of THC and it said the sour diesel variant and it's just a little tiny chocolate bar found it for seven dollars at my dispensary in Orange County and looking forward to giving it a try alright so let's go ahead and open it up here oh it's got nutrition facts on the inside of the label which is handy-dandy 140 calories total there I believe they say it is ten servings but of course we're going to be more that and do it in just one all right so see what it looks like there is the chocolate bar pretty basic looking divided into five big rectangles there okay very little weed odor noticeable weed taste um not overwhelming but it's there mm um I don't hate you it's not delicious but for something as not only 175 milligrams I was hoping for something a little bit less sweet tasting but it's a smaller package so they didn't give me some slack again it's got a marijuana taste to it but it's not overpowering it's not the greatest most overpowering taste in the chocolate you're going to taste chocolate over marijuana but I'm gonna go ahead and finish this bad boy off you know I will come back to you guys as with all our reviews in two hours and let you know how we're feeling because that's the most important part how it tastes is only temporary how it makes you feel well that's your evening that's your day right there so without any uh with no further setup I'll see you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling thanks so much for watching wheats hi guys welcome back to wheat I'm talking Callie gold it has been two hours since I ate this tiny little chocolate bar and I'm pleased I'm not sure I would call it Callie gold maybe more Callie bronze or possibly even Callie silver but it's not bad for seven dollars and for an edible that's only 125 milligrams it's quite potent not very tasty but four dollars to potion potent ratio it's pretty high up there no pun intended so this was the sour diesel variant and it's a nice had hi super mellow super relaxed kind of high not a very sort of cerebral high just more of a mellow kind of relaxed feel so yeah that's the calli gold bar if you see it at a dispensary near you and it's not too much and you're not too concerned with taste feel free to grab one it's a nice little edible that's the calli gold Sour Diesel bar and this has been weeks thank you so much for watching we'll check you guys out on the next review hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please

my shoulder Oh Manny way we are going to show you how I make my canna chocolates I make it with my half a cup of can of oil and it's coconut oil infused with cannabis I make it myself and a cup of chocolate milk chocolate for flavouring this time around I'm going to use raspberry laron oils they're fabulous I use them all the time I make heart candies as well and I use these flavorings in them too so sorry I'm gonna stutter a little bit I'm a little nervous this is my first video I'm gonna put up on YouTube but anyway so and this is my little spoon that I use with I used two of these this is half a teaspoon of measuring with the oil and then in these is what I used as my moles so I'm gonna pause it so I can put my half a cup of kind of oil in to the chocolate and then I melt it that way melt it down slowly in the microwave some people use like a double boiler or whatever but I don't do that I do it slowly in the microwave it doesn't take too long especially if I'm pouring my kind of oil over top of that and it helps the mixture actually it's probably good to go but I just put it in there I'm gonna have to put it in the microwave just to melt it a little further but dying out and then I melt it down mix it together and we'll be right back okay so we're back I melted down the chocolate and it's just a little bit shy of one cup but I'm not too worried about that because um that amount right there will probably make 45 chocolates so I've set out my molds I have my small these are half a teaspoon each these are a full teaspoon so this is a full dose one of these is a full dose you'll have to take two of these depending on your tolerance level some take two three four depending on my pain level my tolerance level is quite high so I switched from smoking to edibles and back and forth so anyway this is what I do I take a full teaspoon of the raspberry flavoring I put it in there stir it around and because it's just me doing this I'm gonna have to pause it again sorry okay so we're back so I've got a tablespoon of the raspberry oil in there flavoring mine if you're wondering within my little box it's all my Laurent oils she's fabulous I loved her oils I use them all the time there's the raspberry but I've got because I make hard candies too I've got different flavoring in there I have a green apple caramel butterscotch root beer creme de menthe and orange I believe so anyway here we go this is pretty well good to go just scrape off the knife it's kind of hard to do when you're looking at it through the camera all right the whatever so then I take my little half a teaspoon and I just measure it out obviously you just take whatever because it's going in the mom like I said it takes two of these because they're half of teaspoons I just find that the smaller spoon goes better into the molds without making too much of a mess so here we go we're gonna go in one of the malls takes two it is to get it falling up as you can see it's pretty level oh don't have it so we just keep going and going and going and going you have no time lapse so I'm gonna pause it and I'm gonna get these done and then they go into the fridge and they sit in the fridge I don't know about 10-15 minutes you can check them after ten minutes because but because my molds are fairly thick molds I keep them in there probably about 15-20 minutes just to be sure that they're all solidified and they're not going to again max jumping on my shoulder on you jerk ball just to make sure that they're solid enough that I can pop them out of the molds and bag them and put them in the freezer so I am going to pause it and fill the molds and put them in the freezer so we'll just end it here but this is what we do and I will pull them out of the molds next okay so there are linear molds and I'm a little medicated because I went licking the spoon after I filled all the molds up it's very good taste yummy that's why they call them edibles because they're so good anyway I'm gonna put them in the fridge now and the next time you see them they'll be ready to be popped out of the malls so instead of waiting for the other ones to solidify cuz it'll take 15 minutes anyway so I'm just gonna cheat here anyway so these are ones that I already made that I put in the freezer and I find that these chocolates I've had them in the freezer not these particular ones but some of my edible chocolates in the freezer for just over a month and they still taste great so I've never pushed it any longer than like maybe five six weeks because sometimes they might get that freezer burn taste so just keep it to your personal preference anyway they might not even last that long but me I don't always eat edibles so I just make them and put them in the freezer so that they're there when I do want them anyway so this is all I do is just you just push on the back of these silicone molds and they just pop right out and then I put them in my bag ease I put about a dozen in each bag and then because they're little freezer baggies they don't hold a lot anyway and then I just seal them off right okay so I got everyone's in there these are crime to match and the ones are in the freezer they're our raspberry so that's it so I hope you enjoyed the video if you have any questions please put them down below and I'll try and answer them as as soon as I can I'll try and keep an eye on it I don't anticipate too many people watching it because I know there's a lot of videos about edibles on the internet but I just thought I'd try my hand on it and on my channel so again this is flower child and I hope you enjoyed the video if you have any questions please post them below and I'll try my hardest answer them okay smile have a great day be true be honest be respectful stay true and stay unique bye", "NO0EeAoIs6w": "[Music] hello and welcome back to the cannabis Somalia I'm your host Andrew Friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of cannabis edible reviews today we have a new producer one I haven't tried before what is it it's called bang or bonk powered by in diva this is our edible today and it is a dark chocolate THC per unit ten milligrams absolutely zero CBD and then our warning is very interesting actually as I read it for my first time the smoke from cannabis is harmful toxic and carcinogenic chemicals found at tobacco smoke such as polar on make hydrocarbons blah blah blah or also found in Canada smoke but this isn't edible so we found that with a few of our edibles already that the wrong warning is actually on the front interesting for what it's worth edible canvas contains the equivalent of 0.66 grams of dried cannabis our ingredients are bitter sweet chocolate sugar cocoa mass cocoa butter sunflower less than vanilla chocolate and then it goes into French stool store in a cool dry place it does not note cannabis as an ingredient which is interesting keep out of reach of children and something that's new on this one actually is the best before date I haven't seen the best before yet on any of these you can see all of our ingredients and then what are we looking at for fats four grams saturated carbohydrates fiber one gram three grams of sugar so the dark chocolate square is you know pretty healthy all things considered it is 70% or 72% Fairtrade dark cacao and then the name bang in India they do these milk concoctions with cannabis and it's they're edible that dates back to like a thousand BC and I've never visited India but from what I've heard and from what I remember seeing they do have stands that sell bong bang I don't remember how you say it correctly if you were in India but that's where they have taken the bang named from so this was packed on December 18th and just excited to see that there is an expiry date on it something that we haven't seen in other ones so we've got our duty seal done locked and loaded and we will crack into that let's see how that goes and how do they suggest getting it I think this is one of the ones where we do it to the side I'm doing I'm having a little bit of a struggle unfortunately oh it's uh it's the inside pinch like so and there we go we're in there's our first look at our chocolate and it's just one nice big piece that you can spread into four separate sections but I'm probably just gonna eat the whole thing because I don't need a two and a half milligram dose to be very honest with you so that's what's in the package that's how it looks beautiful beautiful done and done okay let's give it a smell like we do with all our Chuck I'll do chocolate tastings I'm going to split it into one of the pieces it's very easily splittable mmm it actually smells like pretty good chocolate um I should mention now boom my receipt this was a five dollar dark chocolate gotten in Strathmore green easy so five bucks not overly expensive very little actual chocolate to eat very little sugar which I like it has a really nice chocolate smell actually as far as all the edibles that we've grated go this chocolate smells of the best quality it has under notes of berry obviously AO and all those nice dark chocolate notes but it has some something to it and as it melts in my fingers here we get a little bit more of that expression and it's like stewed mixed berries I smell no cannabis in it so it smells nice let's try and have it takes the melt is quite nice there is no recognizable flavor of canvas powered by India that's who's making their edibles oh I can only assume it's distillate in here but they don't note even canvas as an ingredients so that's interesting no taste of canvas I just eat all in this ethers it's good chocolate which is nice no taste of cannabis at all which again I like I'm not a fan of the taste of canvas not bad as far as our legal edibles go or based on our other reviews and we've been scoring out of 10 for the edibles 5 dollars good price point package nice and clean very little sugar very little fats cheap tasty chocolate was of acceptable quality without a doubt better than the other ones that I've tried for sure no taste of cannabis so $5.00 edible you're just getting into eating edibles you'd like to try something I definitely think this is a good option 7 point 5 out of 10 chocolates there what would a bump this up to 1/8 was with if there was 10 milligrams of CBD in here as well pretty good seven point five out of ten bang dark-chocolate powered by and diva check it out it's uh it's pretty good edible thank you so much for watching I hope you make sure to LIKE comment share and subscribe let

t-shirt on it's a size too big but it still works out it's got the Eagle wholeness of nugs it it looks like money to be honest that's what I think I'm gonna see it they're trying to put money or something subliminal who knows whatever it's a pretty cool shirt though this freak thought I got it they're trying to sell it at another group but another booth is giving it away free today's episode I'm very excited is about an edible Incredibles these are like my favorite brand of medicated chocolates I think that's all they make I'm not sure that's everything they make or not but anyways this is their live tested they have 100 milligrams of THC it's a chocolate bar it's all separated like a like a Hershey bar basically it's Riverrock activated so that means that Riverrock provided the the medication for the chocolate it says on the back here that they use water extraction which is water hash BHO which is butane hash oil co2 which is co2 hash oil cocoa butter and Keith so I guess they use Keith's co2 BHO and water hash in cocoa butter as you see it comes in a pretty cool package it's all sealed this is a monkey bar it's bananas and walnuts in coconut chocolate it's 45 grams of chocolate total weight oh let me show you guys in the new piece it's a little dirty I'll get it cleaned up for a good shot right now I've got the Swan tip on it I repaired the Swan tip on this one it actually spins the water spins here the smoke spins here it provides for a very smooth hit and actually one of these I finally got one you can hit it as hard as you can and the water won't splash you let's just give you a demonstration just just so you can see all right let me do it okay you're hitting it and then you gotta pull it out you guys see that nice that was great let's take a fresh down let's see I got some moon rocks these are not it does not say what strain they are all I know is they are made from co2 so here's an example of co2 there's co2 moon rocks they have a really good flavor it tastes almost like sprite have a lemon-lime flavor they're very good I also have a little bit of bubba kush shatter on my dab on my rod you can't see it too good it's kind of on there I trust me if you see they keep up with my Instagram I just put a photo of a whole whole gram slab on there so well I mean cramps live just a grip just a piece of its a gram a bubba kush Novac shatter it's on instagramming - that looks really good it looks really dark when you clump it up like this and you start smoking on it but that does not hinder the taste oh I got a grandma here so you guys can see what it looks like on the paper compared to it looks like on Instagram see it's kind of like amber looking put it towards the light you can kind of see a little bit of color you can see how clear it is but check out the Instagram photos those are like you it really harnesses the beauty and it's actually this exact piece on the Instagram so check that out you know you want to like it so just go ahead and like it and if you guys are noticing there's ads on my videos now I decided to monetize my videos just so I can be more professional you know I also got this piece as a souvenir of the cup I got it from my girlfriend it's basically just a bubbler with five slit male adapter so let's a little rig with the titanium nail it didn't come with the titanium now I just stuck it on there it came with the green dome you've done this pretty I'll show you that in just a second let's rip it this is the Bubba cutter great piece I love that piece so smooth you think you know how the bubbles Lupo it has the bulbs right here excuse me oh it's got I can anchor need pineapple shape thing down there then it has the old-style splash garden that has two turbines the turbines have six slits Oh there are 45 degree angles oh that bubba kush mess me up that's the vast rome on to the next down and then i will be on to the monkey bar this is a try review I guess this will be like now the one of the first video is the wax and shadow review part 1 that was a Charter Review I did three different types of shadow but this is a three different products this is vho shatter this is who this is bhl shatter that hasn't been vacuumed you guys know about that if you know about it you know about it if you don't you don't maybe I'll teach you someday but this is the co2 wax I guess they call it moon rocks I think that's just the brand it's very sweet and very smooth you know sorry it's almost like inhaling nothing but you can tell it's it's actually like a little less potent you know it's like there's not as much it's not strong is what I want to say but I want to be biased you know because I made the Novak so I'm not gonna now I'm not gonna say that's a fish so that's just my personal opinion now on to the edible the monkey bar oh my gosh I'm so excited I made like two of these they're so good all right guys had the positive get some sanitizer gotta have clean hands touch some dabs and dabbers and I don't much you blow here for the cannabis cups not alone I'll clean their hands where I know I keep my hands pretty clean you never know better safe than sorry and I always want to take the utmost care cuz I don't want to affect the taste of the edible especially since this river activated this time I've never tried river rock before I'm excited they're very popular wolf flip he really likes them maybe they just promote him or he promotes never they cost about each other I'm not exactly sure this thing already looks delicious it's three you know it's three pieces and then four of each sellers 12 it's 100 milligrams so there is about you know almost ten milligrams in each one so it's basically dosed out you know you you really can't get too crazy like they they say this some guy got all crazy um edibles and you know jumped out of a hotel that's that's really sad you know I don't want to make light of that or anything like that especially to the family or the people that are involved with that but it just to me it's out of my comprehension how that could happen it had to have been something else like if this doesn't doesn't had a like everybody that was here when I was with ate a cookie that was over sixty eight milligrams you know and they were all fine they almost didn't even notice the difference so it's just hard to believe all right testerone I'm just gonna go ahead and devour this whole entire piece you instantly taste the coconut right off the bat smooth coconut and chocolate you know it's like mm-hmm it's like an almond joy mm-hmm has crunchy parts to has walnuts but that was not a walnut to have to say so it's coconut flavored chocolate yeah that's what I thought I could taste the coconut and it has bananas and walnut so I guess that was like it dehydrated banana again it was pretty crunchy that was good one more piece for good measure it's actually a high-quality chocolate - it's very smooth it doesn't have like a chemical taste it doesn't like about the classic alcohol taste of most edibles doesn't have any alcohol in it a sneeze cocoa butter the walnuts are diced up like small pieces they're not too big and I'm drooling all over this is so good yeah they definitely improved from last time I'll try it I think I lost time I tried it was last year five over six months ago but wow it's still just as good they're very like I said very smooth very high-quality chocolate no chemical or solvent taste in it it has it has a little bit of the medicinal taste like you taste the herb a little bit but it's a good taste you know you enjoy it's not like oh oh what's that you know that doesn't ruin the chocolate you think it's just like you to chocolate and then after it's like kind of it's like cinnamon you know how soon it has like a lingering a like a lingering effect like almost like a lingering taste like it's probably cuz it's powdered it probably actually does lingering them up a little bit but wow I got to say that's like one of my favorite edibles and that's like a great it's a very pleasurable experience you know it's it's enjoyable it's good it gets you medicated it says it may take over an hour or two hours to take effect but usually if you haven't just like if you didn't just finish digesting it's pretty good sure it's gonna go down and start digesting and like within 30 it's a 45 minutes so it's an hour you should feel something if not you know it's trust looking a little bit that's what I always notice is edibles if you smoke a little bit it's like you know it's like all right like I felt that a lot like is that really really good stuff and it'll be the same stuff that you smoked the day before it's just you you feel it more because you ate the edible and it's cool because when you eat the edibles you forget that you ate them so it's like you forget that you're high so you don't act high and then you'll realize that you are high but no one else can realize it because you're not acting like it if that makes any sense until next time guys although they're gonna leave on that note [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "eTb7xVO_FE0": "what's going on it's Little Miss cannabis and this is my part two video on how to use the pure distillate in the syringe form so earlier I told you how to warm it up to loosen up the consistency so it was easier to use so when it's in that state the best thing to do is if you want to eat it on a cookie just put a little rice grain piece on there and directly eat it that way and if that's not enough you can always up the dose and make your little amount on there bigger another great way to use it when it's heated up in the syringe is you can directly put it into say like a cup of hot tea or warm coffee and that's a great way to use it as well so another way you can use it at is you can vaporize it so if you have a vaporizer that looks like this this is a barbed coil vaporizer you see right in there there's a coil in there and that's what you're going to want to put the actual you know little des of medicine right in there and that coil is going to burn it pretty hot and you're going to be able to be braise it in that way now the best way to use the distillate is a way called dabbing and that's something that they are not allowed to talk to you about at the dispensaries so that's why I'm gonna do this video and show you exactly how to dab it so there's different devices you can use to dab this right here is called a dab straw so what you need to do is use a little torch and heat up the end of it you're gonna want to get it nice and hot it's going to turn a little bit once it does and you can see mine is a little bit you're gonna want to bring that parchment paper out of the freezer put it right on there and go ahead and take an inhale now this is gonna go way down in so you can tell it is definitely a deep hit for sure but this is gonna affect you really really well so another way to dab excuse me is to use add a brick so this is gonna be probably the most beneficial way to use it so what the daybreak looks like is this right here you heat this piece up right here until that gets red you put this piece on and then what you're going to do is have your little piece of distill it on here put it down in hit it that way and then feel it go away down in and then the party begins I have a good one see y'all later", "-fLSI9dm5us": "the bars look yummy but be careful when it comes to edibles there really can be too much of a good thing did you just come here from Kansas and you haven't smoked pot in a decade then you need to have half a square you know if you come in here and eat one of our bars and go hit the ski slopes you're not getting off the chairlift the production of infused edibles and other non smokeable products has taken off making up nearly 40% of all recreational pot sales it's easy to see the appeal no smoke no stench no cough no bongs business is booming it sure is legal but is it the right thing to do what I'm trying to figure out in my own mind is this innocent or insidious do I think this is better than a beer yeah the beer has zero healing properties that sounds like rationalization to me I personally don't have an issue whether you're doing it recreationally or whether you're doing it for medicinal reasons just like anything else in this world as long as you handle it responsibly the emphasis falls back on you personal freedom you", "G0jD8cPWg-s": "[Music] [Music] what up YouTube YouTube YouTube YouTube this is where G smokes this is the only review video an edible review video of nature's greatest watermelon white chocolate one for those of you unfamiliar with Illinois laws I'm fairly certain that edibles can only be a hundred milligrams and that is the maximum allowance for any edibles apparently so unfortunately we really cannot rate this on the scale of one to ten in terms of potency so that will be out of the question but we will be rating it there's a how it tastes the presentation the delivery how fast it takes to thicken and also overall my general thoughts and I've actually never had an edible from this company I've never tried an edible of medical marijuana edible from Illinois dispensaries yet so this is gonna be my first one I'm really excited and without further ado let's get this thing pop open it's smells just like watermelon that's crazy again this is a white chocolate wanna know and bar you guys want to see the back here's the back I'll do a nice little zoom in for you [Music] total THC content is 100 milligrams total THC a is zero and comes in this fancy four-piece looking barn look at that guys it's just smells I gotta live it smells just like watermelon like that artificial flavor a lot watermelon regardless well well and has got green swirls through it now that's still presentation I like it I really I really think it looks just what it's supposed to smell and taste like and looks super watermelon II super kind of fake almost but I like that fake watermelon flavor anyways so here we go without further ado the one thing I have to point out is unlike a lot of chocolate bars these don't have the milligrams on them which is something maybe maybe something nature's grace can work on they're just blanks blank blocks and I know that so impatient prefer to have the milligram and the dosage on there terms of the flavor you can taste the wheat in there it's really good this is not a strain specific chocolate they do not give you what's in it you don't tell you what kind of strain trend uh ground whatever was used to create this Keef what-have-you hatch so my assumptions will be that it was probably made with trend some of the lower great stuff just to maximize your profits which is fine as long as it works and tastes good and we're gonna be the judge of that in a little bit I'm gonna get back to you guys after one hour after eating 125 milligram piece of this chocolate I'll let you know my overall thoughts what I think are strong overall it is in terms of daily consumption and is it worth the money and I'll Dee's I paid $16 for for the entire hundred milligram bar but typically they're $25 apiece I actually got them on that's the only reason why I'm reviewing them because otherwise I really stay away from edibles no Illinois I feel like 100 milligrams for 20 bucks and Ava's just not worth the money at all I've definitely had some strong homemade edibles that are like way beyond that that would just put you on your body with that being said I think the overall taste is really good it tastes very very very watermelon and that mix of baked green and pink flavor it's really prescient but it's good that's kind of like Jolly Rancher watermelon almost the there's almost zero taste of weed in there now you can tell there's weed in there but it's very faint and I think that's what they were going for it's extra sweet I got shit-faced alright again like I said I'll get back to you guys in one hour and let you know what I think about these as my final thoughts and also my through 10 score for now just chill back and hang tight smoke on something showing something drink on something if you got it stay lifted and we'll drive [Music] three hours later what's up what's up you guys and we're back it's actually been three hours since I last talked to you and in that three hours I decided to see two more pieces so I'll just 75 milligrams of this 100 milligram chocolate bar and here's the final square that we're gonna eat right now I love the taste these are gate keys all day delicious what are my final thoughts and my rate well honestly if it wasn't for the price of retail price of $25 for a hundred milligrams my overall score would be like a 9 out of 10 I think they're really good flavor wise taste wise they're very creamy they're very milky they have that artificial Jolly Rancher flavor that I love so no complaints there and overall I love that you can almost almost almost not taste the weed in there it's it's almost not there so really well done really walled me in every wall code however giving that value is important to all of us $25 for a hundred milligrams is so now where is it I mean I literally ate the whole bar today in a matter of a few hours and I'm not even there you might as well have taking your money bought some flour smoked that flour and still feel higher than I do and have some weed leftover first is hitting the entire chocolate bar granted even if I ate it all at once I doubt it would do anything as a longtime smoker and Big Daddy it's not gonna do [ __ ] so what's my actual rating one through 10 on this I give these edibles six point five out of ten if there are $10 there would get a much much higher score in my book but currently for the value and the price on them and what you really got out of it versus just getting flour or getting concentrates or hash it's just not worth it just not worth it and with that there's the would you smokes and I'm signing out stay lifted yeah I'll see y'all on the next one [Music]", "7z8q4A8zwQI": "[Music] hello and welcome back to the cannabis Somali eh I'm your host Andrew Friedman thanks for joining me for an edible review we've got cannabis infused edibles here a new product category to Canada I'm really excited to dive in I'm not gonna speak to the intoxicating effect of any of the edibles but I can review the quality of the food product for you it's ten milligrams in most of these edibles so you'll be able to understand your dose and be a judge for yourself but I want to make sure that we're exploring this new product category and I'm giving you all the information I can for you to be armed with when you go into your local dispensary and go to purchase a new product so let's go I've got four products in front of me and close my eyes and pick this one what do we have today what's going in on us oh I can't see til it focuses it is a vanilla chai bar okay so we have vanilla chai from for a which is actually dose can LD incorporated ten milligrams of THC less than one milligram of CD do not use if you're pregnant or breastfeeding substances in canvas are transformed from the mother to the child transferred to the mother from the child and can harm your baby can harm your baby I've know there's lots of studies about pregnant ladies consuming candidates especially CBD I don't want to get into that I'm not a doctor that's why I'm not gonna speak about the intoxicate effective canvas the weight of this is 40 grams it says the equivalent is two point six seven grams of dried cannabis and our ingredients are milk chocolate sugar cocoa butter milk ingredients unsweetened chocolate soy lecithin vanilla bean seeds are so less than there obviously is the carrier for our cannabis infusion natural flavor cannabis distillate so this is a single source cannabis molecule THC distillate and canvas distillate is the smallest ingredient in here what do we have 2 or 20 calories 16 grams of fat saturated 10 grams trans point2 carbo it's 20 grams fiber one gram sugar 17 grams of sugar for our 10 milligram edible protein 3 milligrams sodium 25 milligrams potassium and a little bit of iron but we're always going to be looking at the sugar amount I think is a really important thing and the amount of calories per ingestible so there we go that's kind of the stats on for a this is my first edible on opening so here is our duty seal nice and sealed you can see I haven't dried any legal edibles yet I guess I will rip that top up and break our duty seal and then these ones you have to go in the back here like this smells like alright chocolate smells like Christmas for sure and there is our ten milligrams so 2 and 1/2 milligrams per square you can see how big it is besides my hand I'll take a square and I'll put this down for now and then we'll do it like a chocolate tasting if you never tasted chocolate before what you're supposed to do is warm it up between your fingers let it melt a little and smells it releases it's got a light chai nutmeg cinnamon those nice baking spices if you've never tasted chai it's really a good reminder of Christmas chocolate milk chocolate it smells a right it's not that fragrant of chocolate it's not like extremely high quality chocolate smells nice let's see how it is maybe like melt okay so there's absolutely no cannabis taste as you'd assume because it's only ten milligrams of distillate so extremely extremely small amount of distillate again I'm wondering how they could dose each square perfectly with ten milligrams chocolate it's alright chocolate a little stiff melt wasn't that quick the vanilla stands out the chai isn't as like indian chai as i would like it I really like a double spiced chai if you like gingerbread cookies ginger cinnamon nutmeg those are definitely the pronounced spices for me the vanilla sits to the back it's a pretty good piece of chocolate it's for seven dollars I might actually like a nicer piece of chocolate this is where everything's gonna fall out of balance it's with ten milligrams of THC in it it's very little THC it's very little amount of actually intoxicating activated ingredient so for me the edible is gonna have to be really really good really really great so I think we're gonna do these out of ten I don't think I can give a hundred points but I think I want to give it out of ten if I was grading this chocolate just as chocolate six and a half out of ten it's not my absolute favorite it's a quite it's a lot of chocolate to eat for a ten milligram dose it's alright chocolate I could imagine this one was packed on November 25th so even in this packaging I could imagine this maybe six months out and this wouldn't be an extremely quality chocolate but I enjoyed it right now so six and a half out of ten for for a vanilla chai chocolate bar ten milligrams of THC this one was a lot one nine zero zero zero three two four there's the chocolate one more time I really appreciate you watching please make sure to LIKE comment share and subscribe there's lots of other candidates reviews cannabis and wine reviews how to cocktail with cannabis how to cook with cannabis lots of great stuff obviously you next time Cheers what's my name what's my name the cannabis Somali yay", "wGLelLSwMS8": "okay welcome back to you weeks everyone the marijuana edibles review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are looking at another product from punch combo we are looking at the peanut butter dark chocolate punch combo 225 milligrams of THC 39 calories per serving three servings in the package we're going to ignore all that and eat this whole bad boy to see how it makes us feel now I have had one punch combo before I quite liked it it wasn't the best tasting snack I've ever attaboy I've ever had but it did hit pretty hard as advertised and it's been such a small discreet little package I mean like look at that a tiny little package with 225 milligrams of THC and it doesn't taste terrible it doesn't taste great but you can definitely Jack it down oh I didn't even notice this before 9 individual 25 milligram doses it shows you what it looks like when it's broken down they're pretty nice not that you really need a reminder Oh berry peanut buttery looking so there you go a lot of peanut butter a lot of chocolate there she is again this is the punch combo peanut butter dark chocolate that we are reviewing on wheats 225 no make up 225 milligrams of THC here we go it's not bad you can still taste the weed um I think it's actually better than the dark chocolate raspberry yeah the peanut butter helps mask the weed flavor better but there is definitely a wee taste to it but it's not terrible I mean you're not gonna you know struggle to get this down it might even taste good dis done not to me but again 225 milligrams of THC in this tiny little package so let's go and polish it bad way off you knew I liked you all right well that wraps up for the punch combo nice and easy to get dem don't have to sit there in two for an hour um but the most important thing as we know guys is not how it tastes but how it makes you feel so I will come back in two hours to let you know how we're feeling then and hopefully it's just like the other punch combo and packs a powerful wallet so guys I'll check back with you in two hours until then thanks for watching everyone has been two hours and welcome back to weeds we are talking about whoops we are talking hello everyone it has been 2 hours welcome back to weeds uh I have just welcome to wheats everyone it has been two hours since I consumed the punch combo peanut butter dark chocolate bar and I'm feeling pretty good I like this line a lot like its predecessor not necessarily saying one came before the other just in the way that I ate the minutes its predecessor it didn't taste super great but uh I feel pretty baked right now and it's such an impressive small little package I feel like you could just throw this in any bag you could take this with you just to anywhere maybe on your way to the airport super super discreet and it for being that potent it's just really really impressive so if you see the punch combo peanut butter dark chocolate at your dispensary near you and it's not too expensive there definitely give it a shot especially if you're looking for something easy and discreet to get down this is gonna this is gonna do the trick so with that being said thank you so much for watching weeds guys and we will check you out on the next review hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "T9WX93x9IIQ": "hey guys what is going on today we're taking a look at another edible this time another tko edible but chocolate dipped cheerio flavor um if you've never heard of tko edibles or tko in general they also they're a black market company they make edibles and also cartridges um i'm not a fan at all of their carts but uh i think their edibles are pretty decent um nutritional facts nine servings per container serving size one square um it comes in a three by three row um you can pause it there for all the rest of it 0.7 grams of stuff because the serving size is so small tko extract oil 35 milligrams per um little square you can pause that there for the ingredients if you need to i've reviewed these before and i believe last time um this packaging was not black i believe it was white but now it's like a matte black with a shiny silver tko and 315 written down because um total milligrams is 315. and i'm a big fan of this chocolate chip chocolate dipped cherry flavor um it honestly is mostly just milk chocolate but the only really difference is uh you flip it around as you can see there's some crispy crispy chunks in there um i guess i'm assuming there's probably cinnamon on them or something but yeah there's another one right there i'm honestly a big fan of this flavor uh it's kind of reminds me of like a crunch bar or something i definitely like this flavor more than some of the other tko ones i've tried but yeah they definitely work efficiently but you never know uh make sure you get these from someone you obviously trust and everything and be very careful with the dosha dosage just try one wait a while and then try more if you need to but um you never really know i forget if they have test results for these or not but um you never exactly know um from bar to bar i'm sure they're not exactly 315 milligrams each some might be 300 some might be 330 or something so if you're sensitive to edibles definitely um take less than you need to and then go from there and on on the front of the chocolates um got tko just just this bottom corner one says tko and the rest just say 35 mg with a raindrop but um if you tried these let me know what you think of them let me know your favorite flavor my dog just tried to get in there i'm sorry but um let me know what flavor you like out of all of these because there are a lot of tko flavors um i have a ton of videos like this on my channel and yeah peace out", "JMFUaIXkCSQ": "what's up hey you welcome to my quick review a juveniles does this is what I do smoke push past and shadow to go and check them up I try them off for you if you like rap you will like my news Alastair the show thank you for the view what's up world juvenile stars coming at you with a cannabis tribute show today we got an exotic strain and it is called two in common so check it out I got an ounce of it it's a for a time so let's open it up dump it over take a good look at it and smoke a joint of it that I wrote and nice padding that light up so let's take a close look at it so when I got it it came nice and like vacuum-sealed up it really nice I also got a nice shadow buyer to try out at the end [Music] so this is an ounce of it trying to hold it so you can see it it looks very nice it has like really nice bright orange hair yeah hold a nice but up close it looks very nice and it is a sativa and it said its average between 28 and 30 you remember like as a strong smoke let's light it up and we'll continue to take a closer look when you get it this is from heaven but when you get it it comes vacuum seal like I said very like nice and very squished together but you've washed it up and it busts still very nice it kind of tastes like really really crystallized like kind of like a smooth frosting and it don't have just like a strong push flavor like most good weed it actually has like times an original taste and probably why sorry [Music] oh yeah that's a definitely a different type of taster was it really expected it but I know it's probably good it tastes pretty good I paid to 24 nouns of this which ain't too bad I'll say tonight came a nice good account I'll give it a 9/10 so this is the bar I will be sampling at the end of the video here so you can stay for the opie tried this kind managed [ __ ] awesome I do really enjoy it I've been wanting some really good different kinds of smoke but a few ounces of smoke at the same stuff mixing it up a little bit as you know cuz I'm doing reviews on you just let your note I'm gonna be doing diletto and platinum cookies next and I just did chocolate stone which pretty much finishes a trio of the skunk like I got chocolates gum yellow skunk a twice gun so go check those oh really explain [Music] so I was expecting to get a new chair for the videos and stuff for my birthday I was gonna bring it on but it's just gonna be a little late so I hope you guys like that when it comes to the nice-looking one so hope you guys like I got new equipment coming for my cameras got new cameras and then mics and all that stuff coming so all my videos will be a lot better quality soon so I hope that you stay for those if you like this give it a sub cuz those will be coming soon [Music] yeah that's pretty my job and my plants are doing good they go with very nicely feminized seeds to do with some other kinds of strains to grow in the minute throwing the monster you guys can see how they do too so I really hope that you're all doing good now that the weather's didn't wanna hope y'all get no doing some [ __ ] stand distant for people but still getting out and having a good time I'll give an overall rating I think of like nine five to ten comments during it's a very good straight it's original type of taste ITC Clinton I'm starting to feel pretty good I feel pretty lifted you know I feel like I'm pretty nice and uplift that I enjoy it I feel nice so I definitely recommend it and just case you're wondering I like to say every once in a while these are the papers I use those you can go see me bio so the biodegradable stuff if you smoke a lot of joint so every that really cheaply we should try them out that's what I use to smoke my joint most of the time so Casey wondered so I did do a review of another type of chocolate bar another THC one it had 250 milligrams too but was only like half the size of this one this one so this one so this one has a nice little pattern on it I guess what to say it just says what it is it's 250 milligrams ten point four milligram extra two per piece so it's 250 milligrams all together and to ten point four two milligrams each week so what I'll do is open it up and I'll try a few and I'll let you know in the comment section later on so here I'll have to put this down [Music] so let's break up a little there's a really nice milk chocolate [Music] so it does have a really nice milk chocolate taste to it I don't really taste too much - you see anybody does taste nice actually the aftertaste I do people he tastes the THC it does taste very nice so this is a shatter bar and you can search at euphoria extractions to find it it tastes very good I do taste the toffee a little bit it does taste very nice I do like the milk chocolate very very good taste so yeah I'll finish this last bit [Music] [Music] it does have a very very nice flavor not too sweet which is very nice and healthy a little bit of toffee tasting so I'm gonna end it there I guess now it's done English so I'll be back but I have to go now that we're all good in stone but I got lots more videos so you can stay for show so bust up some more fish to roll and watch another show now I'm glass you know", "s7F1Z8RVxHU": "alright here we are I'm going Jack working hard at Studio City pot it's starter Sunday so who cares we're just playing video games or relaxing you can see we've made this cool little display of hash oil edibles for you guys a wide array of max power edibles and just delectable excellent chocolates you guys look at this madness just like we've been sampling them and that makes it all the prettier hey let's start they've got a wide variety of flavors here let's start in on the red that is the max power peanut butter deluxe that's a full-sized bar you can see in my hand there we only have three of those right now actually at all these because they're so popular you can see here segments it just like a lot of the other half shell bars on the market right now but yeah the max power peanut butter deluxe absolutely amazing boom check that out what are the flavors we got here we have cannabis crisps that's like a milk chocolate crunch milk chocolate with peanuts let's go around here - white chocolate praline crunch happy hazelnut it is happy indeed here we go trichome toffee right up in there stepping around - my favorite flavor the dark chocolate just needs to cover up the flavor of the hash oil the most and if we come out here to the blacks on the little stems we see a flower we see that is the regular max power milk chocolate let's check out the ingredients while we're down here sour or no wait I'm sorry sugar partially hydrogenated palm kernel oil whole milk solids cocoa powder processed with alkali reduced what is that reduce mineral whey powder or cocoa powder soy lecithin salt added for flavor cannabis oil manufacturing equipment that also processes peanuts you know and then the language about prop 215 and s before 20 making it for Californians to consume as medicine boom but look at the pretty flower you guys as well as the full-size bars we actually eat a lot more than minis you can see here here is a milk chocolate with peanuts this is exactly half the volume and size and cost of the full-sized bars but most people don't need to eat more than one of these most people don't eat more than half of a full size bar here we'll put that back in the display the lovely display I was told they were gonna build some sort of nativity scene or reenact the Battle of the Bulge out of chocolates now it's very excited but I guess it was hard to make that happen on such a short notice and limited budget but look at that pretty pretty flower you guys something else I'll show you kind of weird kind of strange something I've never seen before but as far as I know this right here is the world's largest medicated white chocolate bar look at this you guys this is one giant bar of medicaid and white chocolate that's white chocolate and praline you can see it has a greenish tint to it from the hash floral and from the Frehley and blend it in but this is like you know one by one point to block as far as footage and this is amazing I can't figure out what we're gonna do with this but I kind of just want to take it home with me maybe make like a diorama out of it or some sort of display and then destroy it like a hungry Godzilla eating your medicated chocolate Tokyo all right you guys well I got my big freaking thing here that I'm gonna carry away with me Jack and Moe we're still having the grudge match a basketball over here as you can see and we're gonna get back to slender

cannabis infused Sara we use all fresh ingredients and organic cane sugar and we do everything here from scratch from filling the battles to putting the label into during the packaging you'll take just 1 to 2 tablespoons our syrup and infuse it with some fizzy water and a little ice and mix it up and it makes a great soda and then what happens that do you drink it and after you drink it you'll start to feel the euphoric effects of the THC and it's really really nice body hi", "ppKvv2668OI": "[Music] when I was doing a bite here and today we're going to make some high-quality MCT oil using some canvas so there is a couple of steps to this and we do need a couple of different things so everything that we are going to be I have right here in front of us so we're going to need a crock pot for using this method of the making our empty tio which is a batch to the have right here this is some very potent stuff I found this out last night you're supposed to start low and go slow I definitely suggest doing that so when you're going to need for this is some MCT oil that you could pick up if you're in Canada at GNC health has some pretty cheap or if you go to probably any local health food store they're probably gonna have this stuff you're going to need some cannabis depending on how much you want the rear there are calculators out there and I will put a link for a calculator to kind of give you a rough estimate of how potent your your things are going to be like let's if you want to make gummies or stuff like that so I'm gonna put the calculator below and it'll basically just help you decide what you're going to do now when I made this little here I used 38 grams of cannabis as well as I don't know probably like three four grams of Keef and just the mixture of other candidates that I had around so it was pretty potent stuff so if you're going to use okay so to start we need to talk about D carving your cannabis or decarboxylation it's basically turning your THC a into THC which is what you are really looking to do if you're going to ingest cannabis now if you don't decarboxylate it really won't do much for you so what we're going to do so I guess what I should say is you have a couple of different methods of being able to decrypt leave so you can use the crockpot method because on high they usually heat up to around 220 degrees you put it in a calendar and you just put it there thank you news [Music] okay so there are a couple of different ways that you can be box decarboxylate your cannabis so you could either put it into a canning jar you can put it onto a cookie sheet or something like that or something like this here silicone cookie sheet and you can put this in your oven for about an hour at 225 degrees and that will decarboxylate your canvas this is the method that I chose to do this because when you do it inside of a canning jar with the lid closed you were actually keeping in the terpenes now if you were to just decarboxylate on a cookie sheet throw down a silicone on top of that that put your cannabis right on it you are actually going to lose your turkeys you're going to strip them out of your oil and that's something that I did not want to do so the canning jar method for this instance is a pretty good way of doing that because if you're doing your infusion in the same jar that you decarboxylated it you're going to keep all of your terpenes inside your jar which is great so let's start the process so in the oven 220 degrees for an hour what you're going to do is want to take this out every 15 minutes set an alarm and you're gonna want to turn your jar just kind of shake it up make sure that it's kind of everywhere mixed up and every half hour you're gonna want to burp the jar so you're only gonna burp it once burp it in the first half hour period then you take your cannabis out of the oven you are pretty much good to go so I have some footage that I use the making this oil here and this here is a pretty potent oil I had some last night and I can honestly tell you that you should probably really start slow and go from there don't don't overdo it I made some gummies and just like licking the spoons and the bowls I think I got my fill so yeah make some pretty potent oil and that's we're planning on doing here today it's you know so let's get started and we'll go from here [Music] so the reason why I'm wishing it up like this is because I have 473 milliliters of MCT oil and I know that that won't be a full jar up to here so we're just gonna squish it down [Music] all right that one's mixed up you see this mixed up pretty good here let's get this in the MCT oil and we're gonna get into the slow cooker [Music] [Applause] [Music] so the reason one of the reasons why we did it into the canning jar meant that was so that we were able to keep the terpene profile over animus now if you were to just decarboxylate on a tray we wouldn't got the same abilities out of it so we would have lost all of our terpenes [Music] this here looks like it's just to say covering at all and we got maybe like a couple teaspoons left in the bottle [Music] so perfect [Music] [Music] all righty guys so we dropped her in there and now you just gotta let her do or think what we're gonna do is just I guess probably keep filling this crock pot back up with water as imagine it's gonna get pretty hot and we're gonna lose some of its kind of the steam out so we'll just have to keep an eye on so we'll come back and check them in this problem you tomorrow all right guys so it's been about 12 hours now we put it in a little midnight last night it's just a little bit past noon here and 66 degrees Celsius one hundred and forty nine point seven it's temperature that it's been going at on high and if we take a look at her oil when first put it in it was clear oil now we can see it's a nice dark green delicious looking oil let's see if we can maybe get under light here a little bit sassy we'll get you a better shot your moment with flashlights alright alright guys so I've got my measuring cup I've got the strainer that sits in it I've got my cheesecloth what I'm gonna do is take this out of here this is actually pretty freakin hot play with and we're just gonna let it cool off for a little bit and while that's cooling off let me get some cheese bot open [Music] get a couple little laters wrapped around here don't really wanna be able to see through it but I would like to filter out most of those kind of fine once particles so I've got me one of these Curie filters and that's really gonna get all the very fine fine fine stuff out of it so that's what I'm gonna use for the very fine stuff so for now we're just going to pour it here into the cheesecloth get out most of the large particulates and then we're going to do the finds with this year we should have some awesome future oil and then with this taintdroid we can do lots of things with make some gummies well I don't really know lots of things but other than just that using this nature but I really want to make some gummies and that's what I was thinking about doing so if you guys are interested in that let us know and we will make a video for you on how to make gummies you can probably start to see this I'm not sure if you can see some camera not butter there's a nice green oil nice green danger I think what I've done here is underestimated the amount yes I have underestimated the amount the cheesecloth I would need to strain this out [Music] [Music] oh yeah there's quite a bit in this cannabis though [Music] you've got a clip holding this and now we're going to just do we're fine strain into our jar that we're going to store it in a little bit better review here my messy cupboard cannabis all over it alright [Music] all right so I've got a lid wash to clean ready here what I'm going to do is I'm going to stick a notice I got some MCT oil it was made November 5th 2019 and we're just gonna stick that on here now I'm gonna grab a flashlight so we can kind of see this here so we can see here it is a greenish oil we put it in it was Coulier clear clear and now it's a nice green so what you're gonna want to do the store this oil is it want to put it in a nice cool dark place some people recommend putting it in the fridge and that's one of the benefits of the MTT oil if you put it into the fridge it will not solidify like it does if you were to use coconut oil and I believe that also preserves a little bit longer as well so there's definitely some benefits of using the MTT oil so here you have it guys I hope this video was easy enough for everyone this stuff here tastes really good this tastes a lot better than the textures that I was buying from the licensed producers and with 38 grams plus a couple of grams of Keef this [ __ ] it should be pretty good well so we're gonna try some out and yeah we'll go from there [Music]", "xe82ZmSkluA": "[Music] what's

safety first it's always important to understand what you're eating before you eat it you know as you can see today uh one feedback i can give off the rip is that this this punch bar is not easily breakable so it doesn't just snap off like your average hershey bar so i we do encourage uh cutting them up into the actual squares all right so uh let's get into it let's try it out all right you want to zoom into the camera one more time just so they can see exactly what the chocolate looks like it looks like your average you know little uh cadbury or regular chocolate um deal so oh where are

gone no cbd in here you know what's crazy this chocolate bar tastes better than most milk chocolate rich chocolate than that i'll eat so i would pick this up and eat this over then the other chocolates you gotta be careful all right but um you can't have a name like punch bar like i have high expectations oh man what's your expectations like i must be knocked out i'm not the guy that's

amigos and welcome to meets the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on this review guys we are looking at a new brand something we've never looked at before a brand new product and that is the nut bar let's upside-down nut bar with this bizarre little like little emblem there looks like two upside-down sevens kind of so this is the 100 milligram nut bar cannabis infused a mocha crunch milk chocolate four squares that 25 milligrams each let's see on the back we've got our nutrition information all that good stuff URL boring ingredients and on the back they say at nug we cultivate and extract all our own cannabis to ensure only the finest quality is used in our product line should have read that better all of our products are tested for quality and potency by CW analytical laboratories in Oakland California always like to see that that's always a good thing to see that they are being tested by an independent body because you know some out there can be shady and not selling you exactly what is on the package as promised but these guys seem to be honest and on the up-and-up and I like the fact that all their weed is sourced in-house what do you think frog you like that they're weighted sourced in-house she's indifferent I don't know okay so I like the packaging on it it's got this fancy little pyramid shape or I guess more of a cigarette cigarette shaped thing with a little open here thing on this side so let's follow their advice and open it oh and then on the inside we've got highlights let's go ahead and read it because it's gonna you know it's gonna be overwrought and sort of eye rolling what to indulgences do people love more than chocolate and Phee cannabis oil was then folded into produce an infused chocolate bar with a flavor that will put you on your grind our nut milk chocolate bar is elevated to the next level with the addition of a balanced Bend blend of ground coffee beans the smoky essence of a dark roast paired with the crunchy texture only a slight rose can provide and a bi slight I mean light how do you take your coffee we prefer ours in an ugh mocha crunch bar okay fair enough that was pretty done we are the work hard play hard generation that's also I Rowley we've got our golden packaging here they like the fancy packaging which is good with me as long as they don't take away from the quality of the product okay so here we are here's our mocha crunch bar nug-nug and then those little seven looking things or however you want to pronounce those so uh guys I'm going to go ahead and eat this whole thing oh wow that definitely tastes like coffee good chocolate - quality chocolate if you're a fan of coffee flavored things you're probably gonna love this Wow I actually don't like the flavor of coffee as a beverage but I found that I really like coffee as a flavor um like mocha flavored things or you know espresso - flavored things and I don't I'm normally like a bitter super taster so it's weird all right well I'm gonna finish this off Pete the next couple of pieces and then I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling but for you it'll just be a couple of seconds and I'll be right back to let you know how we're feeling after this two-hour break thank you so much for watching weeks guys and I will see you in just a bit [Music]

that these marijuana infused treats could easily be confused by kids for the real thing Marcus solace has a story police admit it wasn't the arrest of the century an alleged low-level marijuana dealer busted in Tarrytown this week but it's more than buds that were seized there's THC in liquid form attachments for e-cigarettes and what's most troubling for the police chief edibles in the form of gummy candy I feel very strong that there is no need to put it in the form of something that's very attractive all to young children Chief John barber Len says the issue isn't whether recreational use of marijuana should be legal in New York as it is in several states and most recently in Canada his concern is the marketing of certain products containing THC there's two issues here hey is it an attraction to younger people that really shouldn't be making that decision and B what is the possibility of accidental exposure the chief points to a Journal of the American Medical Association study that found in Colorado the number of children hospitalized due to accidental exposure jumped 34% so could the sugary stuff be mistaken for something harder the similarities are striking down to the same shape and coloring of the products so if I was to put this on my counter with my ten-year-old daughter home what's to say she's not gonna pick it up and he didn't think it's a gummy worm from CBS who was to say the difference a difference he says parents should be aware of", "AIhELWPJcO8": "[Music] Aya's Madden roughhouse Studios and welcome to cannabase --ax today we're gonna learn how to make cannabis infused cocoa butter [Music] cocoa butter is a pale yellow edible vegetable fat it's extracted from the cocoa bean and is used to make chocolate as well as many ointments toiletries and pharmaceuticals cocoa butter has a natural chocolatey flavor and aroma and also has a high saturated fat content making it a good vehicle for infusing cannabis in order to do this we're going to need about a 1/2 ounce of dried cannabis - a 1 pound or 16 ounces of food grade cocoa butter and optionally you need 1 teaspoon of soy lecithin powder and to do this year we're going to be using an oven - decarboxylate err cannabis and a double boiler setup to do the infusion you could also use an infusion machine like the mighty fast herbal and fuser and you can save $30 on the mighty fast herbal infuser with a co roughhouse at the herbal infuser calm but to thank them for sponsoring this episode the first step is going to be to grind and decarboxylate our cannabis so what I'm doing now is I've weighed out 1/2 pounds of cannabis and I'm grinding it go make sure I pull out any big stems and any seeds that I may have once I have it all ground up I also want to put this into a dish where I can spread it out evenly so I'm using this large glass there's just so we can see it in the video but whatever big dish you have you can spread it out nice and even so it'll cook even we're gonna put that in the oven preheated at 250 degrees Fahrenheit we're gonna let that D card for 25 minutes [Music] now when you're making cannabis infused cocoa butter you want to make sure that you're using food grade cocoa butter there's other cocoa butters that you could get that aren't necessarily designed for you to eat it might be used to make our hair products or something like that or candles so make sure that you're getting food grade and I'll put links to where you can get that on Amazon okay and we're going to be putting our 1 pound of cocoa butter into a double boiler that's got boiling water underneath it and we're gonna let that melt let's go take a few minutes to melt but I should take about the same amount of time as it took to decarboxylate our cannabis so by the time that 25 minutes is gone by you're also going to have your cocoa butter nice and melted nice and hot so it's that point cannabis is out and we're going to be able to add that into our cocoa butter and this is much like infusing butter or infusing any other kind of oil such as olive oil or coconut oil which we've done before and so it's going to be a very similar process we're going to be letting this infuse for one to two hours [Music] notice I'm letting that infuse without a lid on it and I'm doing that because I don't want the condensation to build up and let any water drip through so you want to avoid letting any water comment on contact with this especially if you're making chocolate but once we have our infusion down we're going to filter that out now filter the plant material out and you can do that with cheesecloth or a cotton muslin bag or a filtration bag if you're using the mighty fast turbulent fuser you'll have that HEPA filtration bag that's included with that we're using a fine mesh filter which works perfect you see we were done there our cocoa butter is now a much darker colored and has been infused with that cannabis has a lot of different flavor now and I've put that in the refrigerator for a little while so it'll harden up and you can see what it looks like but it hardens up very brittle like chocolate it'll have that snap to it and you can use this for a lot of different things you may notice at the bottom it looks like there's a puddle of brown stuff but that's a very very thin just a little color layer there of some very fine sediment that's filtered through and that's nothing to worry about and you could use like a vegetable peeler and just break that off if it bothered you very much but it really just is a very thin layer so I'm just chopping it up now so I could store it and you can store this for as long as you want in the refrigerator you can even freeze it until you're ready to use it and there's several different methods that you can use this for different cooking methods and you can also use it just as it is to moisturize some people may put it in their hair one popular thing to do with it is to make lotions or SAVs out of it and we're gonna be doing a recipe very soon you can see we've made a lotion out of it there so make sure that you subscribe to our Fi Studios because you'll see these recipes that we're making Whitney's coming up we're also making a white chocolate as you can see it's a very very good ingredient to make white chocolate is the main component of white chocolate in fact so make sure that you

yeah we did it you can win one without alcohol yeah thank y'all come up with everything well let me see what you got going on tell me about these three particular brands you have this is I started this winery in 2013 and I put my moustache on the bottle no I did we sold that whoa [Music] I'm pretty high I think I'll go home now and if the bottle glows in the dark - I just thought those oh you

in on your passion yeah it makes everything else a little bit easy well I mean you oughta look at this this is very nice yeah it's look at this [Music] [Applause] listen these two are real ones why don't one that's like traditional it's got alcohol in it is that red or white is red sera sera that's good that's got a refund yeah how much tea a season I borrow this right now it's dosed just like a glass of wine like the intoxicating effects are the same like a glass of wine won't get you drunk but you'll catch a little buzz yeah and that's five milligrams of glass but it's fast-acting how much

we're at 600 milligrams now", "FZD3SldXppQ": "[Music] hello friends welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of that crazy weird confusing and sometimes a little anxiety inducing place called your dispensary and if yours is anything like mine sometimes it is a little overwhelming even for a guy who tries to keep up with all of the different weed products and companies and different consumption methods uh it seems like new things are being cooked up every day in that regard which is exciting to see but can be overwhelming as a consumer today though we're not going to talk about something overwhelming nothing new nothing novel one of the oldest forms of weed edibles that there are is something singular plural um and that that is the good old-fashioned weed gummy yes we are going to be reviewing some weed gummies and one from a favorite brand in our past one uh who is more known for their chocolate bars but now is branching out to the gummy world and that is punch punch edibles a lot of people really like the punch reviews in the past we reviewed these guys years ago they've been around since the um good old uh gray market um more uh only medical days making 200 and i believe 25 milligram chocolate bars uh and they've been around um they continued to exist throughout our new 100 milligram cap era where they curiously uh continued making chocolate bars but they only ever come in 90 varieties there's uh they don't go to the 100 they do 90. why i'm not sure um and it looks like their gummies follow suit as this is a their excuse me tangerine lemon a pink grapefruit citrus flavor all those are citrus fruits assumedly um and it is only 90 milligrams of thc probably shows up a little bit more clearly on those lab testing results in the back or 90.5 milligrams of thc not sure why they don't do the full 100 um but if it's anything like their chocolate bars they you know hit above their weight glass i apologize for the terrible pun i'm sure i've even made it before god damn me um but you know it's uh who knows it's got me talking about it right so this is a 90 milligram edible uh and like their chocolate bars uh they are a more affordable edible uh on the cheaper end i picked this up from my uh beloved dispensary in long beach for 12 buckaroonies and may or may not focus there but yeah not uh not bad for a 90 milligram edible usually trending a couple dollars down from the average so again but you get 10 less thc supposedly uh so without further yammering about this citrus punch fruit snack let's go ahead and open it up see what we got now we got a little dosing guide here uh it shows you what we need we've got 10 or excuse me nine 10 milligram squares because you can divide a square up that way for you geometry fans harder to divide a square into ten very easy to divide it into nine um that's for you arithmetic fans so uh it's got a fancy little plastic contraption very uh uh unnecessary in terms of packaging but you know i've seen more ostentatious but that's a hell of a lot of plastic for no real reason and then we got the extra plastic wrapping this that all says 90 milligrams 90 milligrams everywhere on it oh okay so it is three different flavors of gummies not one giant citrus catch-all smorgasbord kind of handsome looking very starbursty looking and very starburst colored i wonder if pink will be the best here as well let's go ahead and try one of each so i'm going to go and uh like all of our weeds reviews say this every time i review the whole uh product i'm going to review all 90 milligrams that are here i'm not going to necessarily do all 90 right now in front of you but i'll do them over the next hour or so and then two hours after i have that very last one i'll come back to you guys and let you know exactly what we think of these very affordable punch edibles citrus flavored so this pink one is i'm gonna guess the tangerine no this orange one that i've got i'm gonna get my colors right that's tangerine hmm that is a gelatinous cube um quite a bit of weed taste um not as pristine uh a um gummy taste uh or a flavored gummy taste as like a plus or a steezy gummy it's not terrible but there is a definite weed aftertaste to these lemon yum and then for the star of the show the pink grapefruit i'm just going to pretend it's a pink starburst because my mind will make it taste better pink starburst [Music] tastes exactly like it wow okay yeah very strong very strong wheat taste um not overwhelming and you know uh they are more affordable and hopefully that means that they are just potent as af [ __ ] uh and for that we're just gonna have to wait and see i got six more of these guys to go as i said i'll do them over the next hour so how fun was that and once i'm done two hours after that see right back here until then stay high stay healthy i don't know why i tell you to do that you're just gonna see me in a couple seconds anyways i'll see you then [Music] hello guys i'm back it has been uh three ish hours maybe three and a half hours uh since my first piece of the cannabis infused punch fruit snacks um and i am very very happy to tell you nice and simply uh really like this stuff doesn't taste great but it does the trick um even with its 90 milligrams it still feels pretty strong to me um not a lot to have to get through just nine tiny little squares you're good to go or one if that's what your tolerance limit is um yeah and then of course the most impressive part of the entire package is gonna be that price uh usually you can get these substantially or you know somewhat cheaper than other edibles at the same or almost same dosage um and so if these are cheaper for you if these are a couple bucks cheaper than the next level up

cannabis especially me your host Matt lamb today we're making chocolate three different types that were making vegan dark chocolate white chocolate and milk chocolate [Music] this episode of infuse needs is brought to you by 424 high-quality edibles delivered fresh in Los Angeles and Orange counties California please visit 420 food club.com [Music] for this recipe we are going to be using cannabis infused cocoa butter instead of regular butter or coconut oil so for the cocoa butter tutorial you can see a couple of videos back I'll put links in the description for a full tutorial on this but I'm just going through a real nutshell version of it here but basically you would take your amount of cocoa butter which for each recipe is a half a cup and a half a cup to about 1/8 amounts of cannabis would be good and you're gonna activate your cannabis by decarboxylate again in the oven and then infuse it into your oil for an hour to two hours over a double boiler you could also use an herbal infuser machine or some method like that the my fast infuser is a good one and basically you're going to infuse cocoa butter much like you do butter and that's going to be one of the main basis for each of the three recipes that we do today so if you need a full recipe for that please check the link in the description for that tutorial first up is the dark chocolate recipe which happens to be vegan it's the only one that is at this though and for that you need the half a cup of the infused cocoa butter half a cup of cocoa powder 1/2 a cup of real maple syrup half a teaspoon of vanilla extract a pinch of salt and optionally you could add some chopped toasted nuts or some dried fruit the first step is going to be to put your half a cup of melted cocoa butter into a double boiler set up and if it's not melted already it's about a quarter pound and you can use a quarter pound and then we're also going to be adding in now our cocoa powder and if you let your cocoa butter get hot first that cocoa powder will melt much easier and just melt right so give it a couple of minutes before you add in your cocoa powder so it'll melt easier then we're gonna add in our maple syrup next we're gonna add in our vanilla extract pinch of salt and that's it pretty much for the ingredients now we're just gonna whisk those together if you're gonna add chopped nuts or raisins or cranberries or anything like that you want to have that later and before you pour it into your moles which is what I'm going to do I'm gonna head and chop up some cranberries if you don't have a candy mold you can also just pour this out on a piece of parchment paper and then break it into bark and pieces and then I'm adding also some toasted almonds and I'm chopping those up and I'm putting a variety I'm adding some with nuts and almonds I mean with nuts and cranberries some was just nuts and some was just cranberries okay and now I took a little too long doing that so it's thickening a little bit more than I like for it to but it's okay you can still add little spoon and just jiggle it mix it up with a spoon and then just kind of jiggle the pans and settle it down in there so that's fine okay so my molds are ready and I'm gonna let those sit for a couple of hours to cool off and to harden to set I actually put them in the in the refrigerator because it's been really hot in California lately now these are really delicious dark chocolates they're kind of bittersweet and there's some problems you can see on the surface that had to do with the molds and we'll get to that at the end of the video now let's move on and to our white chocolate and for that you need a half a cup of the infused cocoa butter a half a cup of powdered milk two thirds of a cup of powdered sugar two teaspoons of vanilla extract a pinch of salt and again optionally there's toasted nuts or dried food if you want to add that in there are a couple of mistakes that I made in this recipe when I made the white chocolate that I slice is gonna help me make the milk chocolate turned out great but I'm gonna go ahead and show you how I did the white chocolate and then we'll talk about the mistakes that I made at the end of the video so make sure you watch till the end of the video to figure out how I could have improved this but we're taking our powdered milk now I'm taking the half cup of coconut butter or the cocoa butter and melted it and cut it hot now I'm adding in the powdered milk and you can see that powdered milk is actually kind of big granules it's it's big grainy pieces and that's going to be part of the problem that we'll get to later now I'm also adding in my vanilla extract I'm going to go ahead and whisk those together and if you can see on the side of the pan there's a little little graininess that's not really dissolving in that good but now i'm maxeen sifting in my powdered sugar and this was another lesson that I learned during this version of the chocolate and that I could have sifted that chocolate beforehand instead of sifting it into my pan and making kind of a mess and looks like it had a snowy winter night but anyway that was a little bit of a mess it was a to hard to clean up but I should have sifted that powder beforehand that powdered sugar okay now you have all your ingredients and don't forget your pinch of salt that I didn't get on camera but I didn't put it in there and I've taken it off the heat and you can see it's it's you can maybe see from the video here but it's a little bit clumpy looking kind of grainy looking which is that powdered milk not dissolving fully but I went ahead and took a chance and figure that my work out okay and also after it's at a minute you don't really see this in the video either but it's sort of the oil seemed to separate to the top I was really concerned about how this white chocolate was going to turn out and it looks a lot more yellow there's something with the lighting there the brightness of the light it makes it look a little more yellow than it actually was and when it actually hardened in the refrigerator after a little while I was really pleasantly surprised at how well it all homogenized together what seemed like the oil separating to the top just went away it all seemed a very consistent from top to bottom and there were some graininess still in it on the on the tooth when you eat it but I'll get to that in the end and tell you the solution to that problem and so here we go we're going to go into the milk chocolate which turns out great by the way we're going to have a half a cup of infused cocoa butter a half a cup of powdered sugar a quarter cup of powder two whole milk 1/4 cup of cocoa powder a half a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a pinch of salt and again the optional nuts and fruit if you want to add them in and here's where I learned some lessons last time and I didn't sift my powdered sugar beforehand so this time I decided to go ahead and sift my powdered sugar and my cocoa together so the first step is to go ahead and sift your powdered sugar and your cocoa together and to a bowl and have those ready to go you can see sifting it together really makes it nice and silky and here's the other lesson that I learned from the white chocolate recipe with the problem with the milk is to take the powdered milk and put it in a blender or into the ninja like I have and just eviscerate it until it's a very very fine powder so it'll just blow away easily so I've added in my cocoa butter here I've let that get hot and now I'm adding in my finely finely powdered powdered milk and you can see this time it just dissolves right in there it just melts right into it so quickly and disappears into it and not like a grainy sludge like it was last time it's a much smoother consistency and also sifting together that cocoa powder and the powdered sugar made that dissolve so much more quickly is so much easier so if I had done that on the white chocolate I would have been much happier with the final result it would have been had a much smoother consistency anyway this this milk chocolate is going so now I'm adding in my vanilla extract I'm going to also add in a pinch of salt it only takes just a couple of minutes you get a real nice glossy very slick look to your chocolate at that point go ahead and take it off the heat and then you can add in your mixers if you go on to and put it into your molds and I can tell by this one already that it's going to be a lot better than the white chocolate so I learned my lessons there and you can see it really turned out good and the the chocolate there that Mel chocolate has a nice snap to it and it's probably my favorite of the three although that dark chocolate really has a nice richness to they just it's delightful really great so here's what I learned though to make sure you get your molds nice and clean that's why on the dark chocolates got those kind of messed-up looking spots on it there was some leftover oil from a previous time I didn't see make sure you keep water away from your chocolate make sure you pulverize your powdered milk into a fine powder before you add it into there and also pre sift your ingredients and it'll melt into a lot quicker this episode has been sponsored by 420-foot club.com delivering high-quality edibles in Los Angeles and Orange

"Canada's legal cannabis market is about to get a little bigger today the federal government announced that edibles will become available for purchase this December but there are tight rules about what's in it and how it's sold the CBC's Katie Simpson is here with all of the details so Katie tell us what did the government announce today well the government had been expected this is part of the the next wave of the legalization process and so today the government announced that it's not going to be until mid December at the earliest that stores can the stores that are licensed retailers can actually start selling edibles as well as topicals and extracts those are a number of different products that there is a big market for according to some of the people who work in the industry that we spoke with today have to say but again this is part of the larger process with the government trying to to legalize marijuana legalize these products and there are going to be some limits here as well the government announcing that the way that edibles will be packaged they'll be limited to 10 milligrams serving sizes and there will also be continued to be the rules around how much marijuana or how much cannabis people can buy when they are at one of these licensed retailers bill Blair who is been in charge of this legalization program he earlier today spoke with reporters and defended the way the government has moved forward on this I've heard from the industry and people saying but you know we could make more money if you only did this or relaxed these regulations but quite frankly that's not our motivation our motivation is and will always be to protect our kids to protect the health and safety of our of Canadians and to keep our community safe and displaced that illicit market that has developed over decades so the government has said from the beginning that the reason it is doing this is it wants to make it harder for kids to get marijuana it wants to eliminate the black-market those things that'll be a long term achievement that has not happened yet if they are able to achieve that but this is the next step in that wave okay so what's the reaction been so far today well we went to a marijuana shop I'd never been to one before and we went in there very busy we have to fact-check very busy and we went in and spoke with Michael Patterson who's a co partner at fire and flower and he says that one of the biggest things ever since his shop open back in April one of the biggest things that customers ask is when can they get their hands on edibles have a listen just because in the previous black market you really had no idea what you were consuming and because there was such a delayed effect when it hits people quite often but have very bad experiences so there's a lot of people who are interested in consuming cannabis not by smoking it and would love edibles they just don't really want to take the risk of what's currently out there so that opens up edibles opens up a completely different discussion because right now on the black market as Michael just mentioned no one knows what they're getting really also there's the concern which is a concern for the Canadian Centre for substance use and addictions they have a concern about people who might not know what they're doing if they are taking these because the body processes edibles in a different way than if you were to say smoke a joint or smoke Agyei as the kids say have a listen I think one of my biggest concerns is is over consumption or over intoxication with smoked cannabis you start to feel the effects you know relatively quickly if you're using an edible cannabis product so it can take up to two hours before you can feel the effects so this is a next phase thing obviously that centre of the official we spoke with from the centre says this needs to be researched heavily there and there needs to be a lot of precautions around this particularly because there are some very serious fears about you know what if kids accidentally get their hands on this people who don't even know it's a cannabis edible eat it and they don't want to have an experience like that so there's still a lot of work to be done around that but for those who are interested in the edible products they gotta wait until mid-december okay Caity Lotz to chew on thanks so much Katie Simpson I've heard from the industry and people saying but you know we could make more money if you only did this or relaxed these regulations but quite frankly that's not our motivation our motivation is and will always be to protect our kids to protect the health and safety of our of Canadians and keep our community safe and displace that illicit market that has developed over decades Canadians will soon be able to legally consume a new range of cannabis products edibles such as baked goods candy and cannabis extracts will be available this December as well as topicals like ointment screams and even makeup but the government is setting strict rules on them each individual package of edibles will be limited to a maximum of ten milligrams of THC and packaging must be plain and cannot appeal to children also cannabis products containing alcohol nicotine or caffeine will be prohibited unless it's natural caffeine like what's found in chocolate for instance so is industry on board with these regulations Sebastian st. Louie is the co-founder and CEO of hexo a licensed cannabis producer based in gatineau he joins us now from Montreal Sebastian thanks for taking the time I want to start with your overall impression of the regulations rolled out today what's your reaction to those I think from hexose perspective we're really pleased at the progress that we're making in Canada I mean we're on the world stage world leader creating just amazing experiences for consumers and now we have a whole new way to delight our customers so we're very excited about October and December walk me through some of the specific regulations here though because it makes it clear that the products cannot be appealing to youth how do you navigate that what does that mean because a chocolate bar or gummy bear the cookies these are appealing to kids well we're working very tightly with Health Canada on exactly how we roll out the products and bringing a cannabis into responsible use has been a core tenant of what hex has been all about for the last six years the interesting thing about legalization of cannabis as we've seen in the stats in Colorado and now in Canada even is we see a reduction in youth use and so as we move into edibles now we'll simply apply the principles that we've learned from dried marijuana and oils and make sure that we don't put the products within easy access of youths make sure that the packaging is not appealing to them and of course avoid certain form factors when we're talking about gummies about things that could look like a toy or a gummy okay so you have to have plain packaging and how would you make a edible chocolate bar and cookie for example that isn't appealing to a youth because those seem my kids they like chocolate bars they like cookies it starts from the safety of the distribution and then from the safety of the packaging itself so we put everything in child resistant containers and then of course it's up to the adults that purchase cannabis to make sure they store them in a safe location out of the reach of children the limits of 10 milligrams of THC in the package of edibles people tell me that this is a low level of THC compared to what's there in black-market edibles so is this a potent enough limit for the market yeah the exciting thing about the research Heco's doing today is that we can actually increase the effect in body with much lower doses than what's typically seen in black-market we've been able to go to a smaller particulate side and the result is that it's a safer product it's a lower dose it's a better experience for the consumer and we are we're absolutely happy to work within the ten milligram limit people will have a very pleasant experience with with those levels it's legalizing it is obviously a new frontier and experience for Canada but for a lot of people who might try this for the first time edibles might not be the way they are introduced to cannabis for a lot of people so will there be instructions will there be guidance on how an edible would affect a consumer for the first time versus other methods of consuming cannabis so interesting that we're now only legalizing edibles but hexo has had experience with edible cannabis products on the market now for many years we were the first company in Canada to introduce our D carb product which is an edible cannabis powder which fits currently under the dried marijuana regs and so we've built a whole slew of Education programs and working with the distribution and the provinces in getting that information into the hands of consumers start low go slow right so but if I want to try an edible for the first time how am I gonna know how that may affect me is there going to be some sort of advice that comes with the package when I buy it or is it just gonna be trial and error there is reaction and depending on everyone's biological makeup for different doses so that's why we suggest for example especially in the case of our new beverages that we're launching with Molson Coors this coming October what we're gonna be doing is ensuring that the product is sessionable and that it starts at a very low dose especially in the case of THC so the idea that someone's gonna be able to work up to an appropriate dose for the effect that they're looking starting at say 2 milligrams of THC and then if somebody feels that they need to have a higher dose well then they can have a second or third session of the product ok so what are you doing with moles in Korres because the regulations on the Edible says no alcohol no nicotine no caffeine how's that working well we we think that mixing alcohol and both this is both hexo and Wilson's position the mixing alcohol and cannabis is unsafe and so we're not shipping any product that will have alcohol and cannabis together what we're doing is we're creating formulations powered by EXO that'll help people for fun sleep focus sport sex and Diet we're inserting those formulations into all kinds of great based beverages that Molson is investing in and those will range from sparkling waters to waters to of course some d alkalized beers that people are familiar okay so using them for for manufacturing and distribution and bottling and canning and that sort of thing but not alcohol connected with it no but the base products as well that they're investing in because they're starting to diversify and starting to buy other beverage brands outside of beer okay so most of course doesn't have trouble supplying the market with its product the marijuana industry the cannabis industry has had problems supplying the market since since legalization began how do we avoid some of the problems we've seen with traditional cannabis on edibles I think that there's been a lot of lessons learned by the industry in the in the last six years heck so for one is ready for October 17th now it looks like it may be a few extra months to get products on shelf but we're already ramped up the logistics supply chain is done we have the largest cannabis manufacturing Center on the planet in Belleville Ontario 1.5 million square feet of straight manufacturing we have over 1,100 employees hard at work including 25 top phd's food scientists and the products are going to be absolutely fantastic and ready on store shelves with our partners of course starting in Quebec with s QDC but Canada wide okay

Wow really really creamy texture of it it's just amazing Wow so you guys are all about doing stuff from scratch yeah is that part of food culture here in the Pacific Northwest yes it's almost like a religion yeah I mean you can really taste the difference I'm going honey mmm Wow mmm holy crap okay here's your milk great what do we owe you for that that's okay you can have it oh really yes my gift to you in that case here's my gift to you it's this really fine bud you seem like you enjoyed that Jay I have to say I did excellent so enjoy the rest of that bunch and we're gonna go put this to good use I've got my jar of fresh milk that I picked up from Cornerstone farm and I've headed over to Vashon velvet where one of Jodi's friends an amazing cannabis farm where she grows some really banging buds we're gonna pick our buds and I'm gonna go put this thing down cuz my hands are freezing right now [Music] before we do anything everybody needs a name tag state regulations excellent want to be in full compliance how did you guys get into the cannabis business when the state announced the rules for getting a license to grow cannabis they said there was a 30-day window and they might never have another window open so I thought chance of a lifetime we went for it and never looked back enjoyed every minute of it Bravo that is fantastic awesome and are you a cannabis enthusiast yourself I never know and then if it's a Saturday night I'll try some of the Laughing Buddha yeah so I wanted to show you the strain that I think would make some really great cupcakes this is our platinum blueberry this is a really space-age looking grow right here go ahead and stick your fingers in and take a sniff wow there are so many different flavors going on there I mean beyond just that tart blueberry aroma there's so much else going on like a maple syrup or yeah I can't get enough of that smell and as you can see we use exclusively LED lights which use about a third of the energy of regular standard HID lights so we're trying to reduce our carbon footprint as much as possible so Patrick how far along are these guys right here these are about two to three weeks from harvest at this point oh that good karma is paying off because I mean you've got these incredible looking buds so Jody do you think this is gonna go well in your cupcakes I like the sweetness I'm excited to see what it tastes like when these guys said they make stuff from scratch they were serious I mean every single ingredient comes from the source I met the cow that we got our cream from and I met the cannabis plant that we're gonna get our buds from and now I'm hanging out with the chickens we're gonna get our eggs from and then we'll be ready to make cupcakes [Music] we have all the ingredients right here to make cupcakes and it starts right here and we're going to skim the cream off the top how do we turn that into butter we have to churn it and this is a butter turner it's crazy steam punk jar that looks pretty arduous for one person but here check it out I have an idea if you just hold the jar and I'll go like this Wow don't hit this a little bit how long does it actually take it's gonna take about 30 to 45 minutes yeah that looks like butter all right and what we're gonna do is we're gonna put this butter into this bowl and we're gonna press it against the side to kind of squeeze out more of that buttermilk all right I think we are ready to melt this up and to infuse it with our canvas okay Jody how much weed do we have decarboxylate in here this is one gram of platinum blueberry from Vashon velvet threw it in the oven at 290 degrees for an hour and that allows it to decarboxylate which means it releases the THC what we're going to do with that we're gonna put this in this 1/2 cup of delicious butter we've been working so hard on and infuse it for 30 minutes from super low heat we're starting to smell good already so you're ready to strain it we got some cheesecloth in a strainer here with the bowl underneath it we're just gonna pour this straight through the cheesecloth there's all our spent weed flowers okay so what goes into a cupcake batter we're gonna put in the dry ingredients I have two cups of flour here then we have 1 and 3/4 cup of organic cane sugar so one teaspoon of baking powder and result is this gonna give you a little mix to combine them just a little make them next step we're going to add our cannabis butter yeah we put a lot of butter we get last wrap alright that looks good I like how it's breaking up we're going to take some of our wet ingredients and mix them together we're gonna start with four egg whites so we're gonna add to that a half a cup of warm water we're gonna add a half cup of sour cream we are doing in this recipe one teaspoon of vanilla paste and this is Madagascar per bone vanilla so we're just gonna whisk this together and now we're gonna incorporate this is going better let that mix a little and now we have a nice smooth delicious looking manner that is looking super creamy these are ready to go into the oven huh this is this is exciting as soon as we open that door back up we'll have cupcakes let's put them in the oven 325 we're gonna start with eight minutes and then we're gonna rotate it after eight minutes and do six more minutes or 14 minutes oh yeah those are perfect it's like beautiful awesome alright so while those are cooling let's open some good chip chocolate and get ready to make our buttercream this is our deep dark chocolate bar the Washington state serving size is 10 milligrams Wow tasty there's no plain tea flavor and I can barely taste it yeah you really gonna talk about it - yeah yeah I like it alright so what we're gonna do is we're gonna melt eight-pitch of chocolate bar so this is gonna be 80 milligrams of THC spread across 12 cupcakes that's about seven milligrams of cupcake we did the math on the cannabis cupcake batter and that is scene or so a milligrams per cupcake so you add that plus the seven and rectory all right great pretty potent cupcake we're gonna start with putting 2/3 cup of our delicious hand turn fresh butter so we have two and a quarter cup powdered sugar we're gonna add a pinch of salt blend it all up slowly so you don't get the cup cloud we're gonna put three tablespoons of fresh milk going back to the Madagascar I'm going to put one teaspoon vanilla and we're gonna add the cannabis infused good chip chocolate yeah that was amazing we're gonna let that mix in we're so close to having cupcakes so I'm a big fan of a hand swirl instead of piping on although you can do the other and grab a little dollop and then you do a very magical thing to kind of Pat it and then you give it a little loop right I swirl on that one Cheers thank you so this is the best cupcake in Washington State huh let's see what you think mm that's a good cupcake oh my god experts you know what they do they go like this they break the bottom up and you put it on top super easy get out of town I wish I knew that point but into this thing this thing is double infused we infused the butter that went into the cupcake batter and we melted a bunch of your delicious medicated chocolates and put it right into the frosting boom boom this is a strong guy this cupcake right here is a representation of the adventure we had I had the fortune of seeing where all the ingredients are a lot of the ingredients that went into this came from really I mean it all just came together in the best cupcake I've ever had excellent truly

looking obviously all you care about is edible so let's get to it I'm kind of always looking for a edible that doesn't taste like weed and especially edibles usually when I get edible and when like a festival I'm going somewhere boring or I'm going to your mom's house I don't know how someone can eaten at all like my best friend Katie didn't attaboy she just eats it like a puppy I'm sick do not taste that I get my little button to eat this nasty [ __ ] like you ever do that once it tastes like [ __ ] and your mom make you eat it you hold your nose put your I'll be 12 and then you let go and it's like okay we didn't tasted it off well that's what I have to do any eat edibles they're from I don't know maybe like 5 different youtubers now that this this edible does not taste like weed I was like so I'm excited to try it the flavor is almond nut toffee which is like my favorite too I love coffee and I love almond does my breath smell it's just a like a silver wrapper it's as liquid gold bars all over it the liquid gold bar but the people who make it it's called Jade farm labs and the way you find it if you want to try this for yourself is you go to G firm labs.com like google their website and they have a list of all the chocolate they have and then they have a list of all the dispensaries that spell it I also don't have my break I just had a call places that don't require a wreck and they just need you to be 18 over and they make you sign this waiver or whatever I'll leave the place that I got mine from in the description bar if you want to go there and try it yourself

"Q8XAXIZuKLU": "alright so the first product I'm here to show you today is some flour this is tangerine haze here and this would be one of the products that people would buy that is smoked or vaporize and we sell it by the week very popular somebody may use this particular strain and some people report that it's very uplifting good for the morning time to get your day started so everyone's experiences may vary what may work for one person may not necessarily work for the next but in my personal experience tangerine haze is really good because it uplifts mood gives me a clear head without getting anxiety so it's a good way that you can start off your morning one of my favorite parts about the bar is if you see here there is child resistant packaging so I actually have to squeeze both ends here and then and then to show you what the actual chocolate bar looks like on the inside and the really cool thing about this - which is important for the adult use regulation is for edibles the serving sizes cannot exceed 5 milligrams per serving and it cannot get more than 100 milligrams per package and each one of these pieces of chocolate here has our contains THC symbol with the little leaflet located right on the bottom and that is required to be on all so this consists of five pre-rolled joints so I'll show you the child resistant opening we got here and when we lift it up as you can see number 1 2 3 4 5 are your 5 joints and on the back which is the really cool part is it gives us testing information so we know how strong each individual joint is and how strong it will be and again like everything else we got our contains THC symbol on here so we got Moomins here which is another edible that you may purchase here at meta which is a strawberry gummy and just to kind of give you an idea of what they look like this is what they look like here and one thing you may or may not notice is on the actual edible itself and again it has that contains THC logo that's required to be on all of our edibles and our one person might choose to have a gummy is because they may not have dietary restrictions and they prefer gummies say choc over chocolate so this could be another way to medicate but just keep in mind that all edibles work the same so go low and slow and wait a couple hours before you begin pretty simply it is a vaporizer that works similarly the smoking step to a Down of the carcinogens that happen with combustion so with this this is a great way to get medication that if you need to be more discreet or anything along those lines and the one thing I like about this is for people who may have hand dexterity issues there's no assembly required you simply just your inhale will trigger the battery and then you go from there so one thing to keep in mind about the apex one is it's made with our distillate oil which happens to be the most pure and potent in the store so I may not recommend this to somebody who's starting off or if they are trying it too definitely again go low and slow and try it in a safe space to see how it makes you feel so the lotion is really good for localized pain relief myself I had a lot of back issues so I will put the lotion after a hot shower my pores tend to be open more so the medicine gets absorbed and it really helps with the inflammation and loosening my back up in that particular area and one thing to note is that most people report with topicals it's a non-psychoactive so a lot of people could use the lotion and go about their daily lives doing the activities they want without necessarily the psychoactive so for the lotion in particularly for most things I would say start with a couple pumps but definitely depending on the pain will determine how much lotion you're gonna want to use now elevation oil is a grapeseed / NCT cooking oil now you could use to add to all the recipes that you'd like I know some people use it for salad dressings some people just take it in the TSP and eat it and some people even use it as a topical application but the really cool part about this is it's dosed out by the TSP and for those who have dietary restrictions this could be a really good option for those who are looking for an alternative to a tables is a singular pre-roll that we sell here so you do not necessarily have to buy in the packs you could buy it by the pre-roll and this is about how big they are and what they look like so people can either have the choice to buy the loose flower like tangerine haze and roll it themselves or if they wish that it rolls for them for any reason so the next product that I'm going to show you is what we would like to call shattered now a little disclaimer with shatter it tends to be a bit potent so I wouldn't necessarily recommend this for somebody who's starting off with cannabis but just to show you why it's called shatter shatter is a butane hash oil that is then purged off the butane to give it a glass like translucent appearance so this is something that you so those who are inexperienced I might stay away but if you do again have a greener right sized piece and the Colorado middle some people tend to be more used to more regimented medicine meaning taking it at certain times in the day so we tend to make this a little bit easier for them and then also again with dietary restrictions this should be another great edible for people to try", "31V9LA922yw": "hey everyone shoenice again well basically you're probably wondering what's in front of me these are edibles the state of Colorado the

easy way hello my name is Jeff and I'm Andrea and we're from neuro growth CA nice and we are so excited to be here today to talk about chocolate making and be sure to click that bell below the video so you get notified about all our new content so we want to get this on the go right away Andrea take us away alright so our very first ingredient that we're gonna add to our double boiler is cacao butter so I'm gonna put this in and Jeff is going to explain some of the benefits of this yeah so notice how she did say cacao butter not cocoa butter this is something we would have to do a whole video on but when you use cocoa it is highly processed you're gonna lose out on a lot of the benefits that we're gonna be talking about in this video so be sure to do your best to use raw cacao butter and paste and we're gonna have links below the video for you to get all that so we've got the butter in there which is the fat from the cacao now what's this next one here all right so we've got 95 grams of cacao butter in the double boiler the next ingredient to go in is 95 grams of cacao paste so we're gonna put that in and maybe we should explain what a double boiler is so a double boiler method is a way of preparing chocolate that doesn't burn it so what we do is we take a pot and we fill it about a third of the way full of water we bring the water to a boil with a Pyrex Bowl on top something that's heat resistant and isn't going to crack under under the high temperature then once we put all of our ingredients in here they're separated from the element on the stove and that's what really prevents them from burning yeah you don't want it to burn and even furthermore if you want to take it to the next level you could use a thermometer to measure the water and to measure the chocolate to make sure you're right around or below a hundred and fifteen degrees Fahrenheit that's the magic number and if you start to go any higher a lot of the enzymes do what's called denaturing they start to deform and you're gonna lose some of the amazing benefits that raw chocolate has to offer and of course like she said the waters in the pot there's no water in the bowl so you're not getting any sort of contamination and this is all starting to mix together and melt quite nicely and why that why that's happening or sorry as that's happening let's talk about micro dosing for a second why would anyone want to microdose magic mushrooms now for me personally I've struggled lots in the past with depression with anxiety and of course you know I fixed a lot of that or worked with a lot of that via food meditation yoga but somedays especially in today's society even when I'm checking off all those boxes I've eaten right exercise sometimes it's just not quite enough I need a little bit more of that mood elevation that a psilocybin brings to the table and of course I'm not interested in tripping out or hallucinating and that's what makes micro dosing so amazing for me and do you micro know Sandra yeah I do my kurtosis I like to follow a regimen that's a four day on three day off schedule I feel like that's what gives me my optimal focus and just helps keep me I don't know like just content and happy and free from free from stress and it really turns off like you said the monkey mind that goes on in the back your head and just allows you to live in the moment and be who you are without the little voice you know behind on the on your shoulder and telling you to think you know telling you all these things all the bad yeah it's you know it's tricky I know that little voice in the head you know it can be so annoying tells you things you don't want to hear but you really want to learn to work with that voice and work with yourself and personally I have found that you know the prescribed SSRIs the prescription antidepressants turn that off it's insane to me it's you know after four weeks of being on them you know I had this experience where there was like no voice in my head and like we were saying I wish I could have an on/off switch for it but I never wanted to be gone and I find using a psilocybin doesn't really turn it off but it definitely changes the tone of that voice it's a lot more encouraging it's not like this you know nagging person who's telling you you're never gonna get it done you're never gonna do it so it's so important and it's something that you know is worth trying for sure so how are we doing with the chocolate here looking pretty good we're almost we're almost melted it's probably going to need a couple more minutes you know one of the things I was going to say about SSRI drugs also is that they often leave you feeling like you said just disconnected you know whereas micro dosing it's the exact opposite when you micro dose you tend to feel more connected to the people and the world around you which is a huge asset and a major reason to consider my producing I love how you said that and I've heard so many people explain it in a very similar way where they've been on these prescription drugs for a long time and they feel like they've lost a part of themselves and you know on the contrary when they microdose with mushrooms they feel like they're connecting to something so much deeper so that's such an amazing point and I also love how you said earlier how you do four on three off I'm more of a fan of the five on two off but no matter what you resonate with more it is extremely important to take time off every single week you want to keep your tolerance to a psilocybin low so that you're not having to constantly take more and take more and I know a few people who never take days off this becomes more of a crutch and then they get very depleted of their neurotransmitters so like anything it can be abused and when you take those days off it just keeps you in check keeps you responsible and now what an amazing thing amazing thing too but the days off as many people find that their best productivity and their best focus and best mood is on their off days and as the brain heals itself with these potentiating herbs and mushrooms that's that's exactly what's supposed to happen you're supposed to feel better long term and that includes your off dates yeah and I think it's such a confidence builder when you feel good on the off days it starts to make you realize oh I don't need to take these all the time this is actually healing something inside of me it's not just a drug I'm taking to mask something now another thing I love to take to help me with my mood and just you know overall feel good is of course chocolate so you can see how this becomes such an amazing synergy now one of the reasons I think you know raw chocolate raw cacao is so powerful it is it is in fact the highest source of magnesium in a whole food and magnesium is the mineral that most people are deficient in I can't remember the exact numbers but it's insane like over 70% of Americans are magnesium deficient so what does that mean you know why should you care about magnesium well it is an extremely long laundry list magnesium is used for hundreds of functions in the body in fact each and every one of your I think it's three trillion cells needs magnesium every single day it's needed for muscles I'm sure you all know someone with the restless leg syndrome and that can be a sign of magnesium deficiency so chocolate is such an important superfood and Andrea how do you use chocolate I like to have a little bit of chocolate every day I mean who doesn't usually mid-afternoon when the kids are getting home from school that's what I like to you know break a couple squares off and just enjoy it it's kind of I don't know helps me mellow out and set the tone for the rest of the afternoon kind of a little pick-me-up I love it and this is why I love making chocolate because if you buy it at the store it's not the chocolate that's bad for you it's usually all the other stuff in it the white processed sugars etc so when you can stay away from that and use other sweeteners then you know you're really gonna have a medicinal experience and not something that's just taxing the body and something it needs to get rid of and speaking of sweeteners what are we using to sweeten our shop yeah so we're using maple syrup to sweeten our chocolate you could also use honey if you preferred we've the reason we opted for a liquid sweetener is because it's just it's nice and smooth as opposed to a as opposed to a granule of sugar like say coconut sugar or you know any other kind cane sugar or something like this so when we add maple sugar it just blends in so seamlessly and we don't really have to worry about mixing it a whole lot so once your chocolate is totally melted then you can go right ahead and add the sweetener nice if you are using a granular sweetener I would definitely recommend it as opposed to just stirring it with the spatula yeah I'm a huge fan of the liquid sweeteners as well it just it blends right into the chocolate now I do like having some crunch in my chocolate but if you rely on the sugar for that then I find you know some pieces have a lot other pieces don't have much and it's just not a smooth experience and now speaking of crunch what do we got here up next yeah so our preferred way to add crunch to your chocolate is by adding cacao nibs which is more chocolate okay you can't really lose out so what Kanekalon abs are as they are just cacao beans that have been ground up and just into little small chunks now what we do is we grind them up even further in a high-speed blender just to make them into a bit of a powder and this retains the crunch still but it's nice and evenly distributed throughout the bars rather than having a big chunk like this I mean you could do this if you wanted it's all a matter of personal preference but this is this is what we prefer yeah Ike I said we're big fans of that smooth experience everything blended very well but definitely experiment at home and what's nice about having the cacao nibs just in the house is it's a way to eat some cacao with zero sweetener now it is quite bitter and in fact when you eat that this is when it will make sense to you that cacao is indeed a medicinal superfood it is not I mean I love the taste even the bitter nibs especially like I find it really grow on you at first you're like no not what I was expecting but you'll find yourself craving it and I think this all ties back into the magnesium is your body says hey give me some more of that stuff and just going back to some of the benefits of cacao this is an amazing vasodilator which means it opens that heart right up opens up the veins and the arteries it softens them so you can have increased blood flow which is excellent for exercise recovery and so many other functions and you know just so many is that literally the list is so long of what that can do for you but if you have blood pressure issues heart disease which is so prevalent in society today then cacao is definitely something you're gonna want to look into all right so let's give this a stir in it was getting in there now this isn't gonna emulsify completely like like the other ingredients that we've added there's going to be little chunks you're going to notice that there's little little grains of cacao nibs inside of your inside of your pot inside of your bowl yeah and that's perfectly fine it's those little granules that are gonna give you that nice nice crunch and so now I guess we've got one more ingredient here that's you know kind of part of the basic recipe and it's a such an important one what is it all right so this is right skipping a step here so this is salt so we like to add in an eighth of a teaspoon of salt salt is pretty much a critical ingredient in chocolate it helps to round out the flavor profile and so a little bit goes a long way just an eighth of an eighth of a teaspoon and your your goal good to go and don't worry how the measurements will have it all in the video description below but you know if we've have any chefs watching as you know that contrast in flavor is so important so we've got some bitter from the cacao we've got sweet from the maple syrup and now there's a little bit of salt it just gives it such a nice little twist and it really brings out some of the other flavors I'm speaking of measurements we added a quarter of a cup of the cacao nibs lips to our ice nice let's put her in got a little bit of salt in there so that's the basics for chocolate like if you were just gonna make chocolate for friends and family you didn't want to use any sort of medicinal herbs that was an amazing recipe to use as your baseline and then you can kind of like a set experiment with the different sweeteners more crunch less crunch you can have it more of a white chocolate if you use more of the butter there's literally endless endless possibilities atoms atoms are actually endless fruit you can use high-quality essential oils I mean literally the list is endless vanilla although insanely expensive these days is like vanilla and chocolate is just a match made in heaven and if your flavoring with things like vanilla and maybe extracts always make sure that they're oil-based because if you add water-based or alcohol-based extracts to your chocolate it's going to cause your chocolate to seize and you'll ruin your batch that would be so sad yeah it literally ruins the whole thing you're gonna want to stay away from that so now let's get into some of the medicinal things we're adding to this chocolate so we are actually going to make the neuro Grove snack chocolate bar so just like you're used to getting in our neural growth caps it's gonna be the same experience but via a chocolate bar so the first ingredient we have here is one teaspoon I believe one teaspoon of mucuna so mucuna which we'll let Andrea tout here this is amazing for dopamine it's got l-dopa in it which is a precursor it's just a fancy way of saying it gives your body the ingredients it needs to make dopamine which is one of the most important neurotransmitters in our brains it's all part of the reward system that our brain uses to make us feel good to make us feel like we've achieved something so so so important and another cool thing about dopamine is it can be a little bit energizing it can be muscle building it's even a precursor to HGH which is human growth hormone so so amazing and it's even got adaptogenic properties to help you out with all the stress we face in life today and then the next one we got one of our personal favorites is the lion's mane mushroom now once again we've got one teaspoon in there you can use more you can make it more medicinal you know you can add it in there stir it up like she's doing and then taste it if you say you know it's not very much for me I could use more than by all means make it more medicinal it's just gonna give you some more superpowers powers like you know better memory increased focus you know that's what lion's mane is all about and it's not even all about upgrading the brain but it has some amazing components that repair the brain and rejuvenate the brain all naturally so such an amazing amazing medicinal mushroom you know there's we don't have very many good studies yet but things like Alzheimer's disease especially in the prevention side of things you know huge hugely important and we've even seen some people with Alzheimer's they use the lion's mane with the oscilloscope in that we're gonna talk about here and they're getting some amazing results so it's definitely something you're gonna want to look into and just kind of stick up-to-date because there's so much research coming out right now it's it's tough to keep up with to be honest well the studies are rolling out like crazy the John Hopkins University and also the University of Toronto and P real college London all have psychedelic research centers now our human studies are going on so you're getting double-blind randomized placebo-controlled controlled trials all these high quality studies that people look for when they're trying to determine whether or not something is real science or anecdotal evidence and so these studies are coming out and you can just you can be you can see that maybe you like rolling out by the day cuz it's crazy you know we were really studying these things in the 50s and 60s but when a psilocybin became illegal we won't we turned it off we walked the other way so now that the doors are opening again we are just finding out some amazing amazing staff so now I'm gonna get into our final ingredient here the star of the show and this is our a psilocybin now we're not gonna mix this into the whole pot here and we'll show you what we mean because we've made enough chocolate here to probably make about six different bars and this amount of a psilocybin one gram is just for one bar I'm not a fan of making a huge batch because you want it to be as accurate as possible this is of course for micro dosing it's not for partying so you want it to be as precise as can be and of course some of the benefits of a psilocybin are increased in flow state it really turns off that default mode network in the brain which is a fancy way of saying you know when you look outside you're gonna see things that you know you've never seen before even though you've seen them a thousand times you're gonna see the same trees the same flowers but you're gonna go wow that looks so beautiful and you're gonna feel happiness and it just becomes such an amazing experience so I think we're ready to go here yeah so part of controlling the dose of the bar is measuring and so we know that in these particular trays that we can fit in a quarter of cup of our liquid chocolate that's what we'll do is we'll just measure out you might need a help guide help guide it in there or spoon maybe even to whatever you have on hand looks pretty delicious I'm definitely waiting hungry so then what we do is we put that into a small bowl and then we can whisk in our psilocybin yes so once again for one bar we're going with one gram of our golden teacher a psilocybin and one note I'd like to make two you know we're talking about the studies and and one of the biggest things when it comes to studying any sort of medicine drug herb is safety you know is this safe to take and one thing I always like to tell people is you know there are some psychological you know dangers I don't really think there is with micro dosing but with macro do you started with macro dosing you can definitely run into some issues like the bad trip and and so on but when the micro dosing scenario it's extremely safe and in fact there is no lethal dose of a psilocybin I would say almost everything in your medicine cabinet at home is more dangerous than a psilocybin mushrooms you know if you take too much Tylenol like you can actually die even taking a little bit of Tylenol although needed sometimes can have you know a toxic side effect so with the psilocybin this is an extremely safe herb or an extremely safe mushroom I should say so don't be scared about all the stuff they were saying in the 70s and 80s toward people away really do your own research and come to your own conclusions on if it's something you should try or not all right so we're just gonna pour this carefully into the mould as you can see it flows really really easily and we want to make sure that we scrape out this container so that we get all of the medicinal properties that we've invested in adding with these ingredients into our bar one cool thing about chocolate I never said either is that they're realizing it is one of the most complex foods on the planet there's actually several compounds in the chocolate and they have no idea what they are and I always just think wow that's you know we think we're so advanced but there's still so much that we don't know okay so once we have this poured into our mold we can pop it into the freezer just like just like so and how long is that gonna take before we can munch down I'd say for sure ten minutes but I'd give it 15 just just to be on the safe side you want it to be nice and crispy mm-hmm so we have some that we made ahead of time that we can show you so let's show you guys and yeah what's super cool about this mold is it's got ten individual squares that can be broken up so as you remember we used one gram of the oscilloscope on and it's evenly mixed into the one bar and that would make each little cube point one or a hundred milligrams which in my opinion is the perfect microdose and of course if you wanted to do more you could eat more and you would have an actual you know if you could measure it it's not just random and again that's why we like to mix the oscilloscope in right into the individual bar you want it to be as accurate as possible yeah and it's really really easy to do it doesn't take much time but it's a really important step because you are using this as medicine and you want to make sure that you're getting the right dose every time yeah I mean you just want to be respectful with it right you don't have to be crazy you don't have to be super super scientific but you do want to take it seriously it's not wishy-washy this is very very potent medicine and although safe it is you know it's extremely effective and you want to use it properly but anyways you know this was so much fun I love to make chocolate I love to taste chocolate Oh should we try some absolutely okay let's see how we did Cheers Oh Cheers mmm nice mm-hmm texture is good there's a little bit of crunch there it's creamy mm-hmm you know very soft just melts in the mouth very good and like we said you can take this in so many different directions with flavoring in fact I would love to hear from you like what is your favorite chocolate and maybe if you even if you've never made chocolate you know what do you find self reaching for it the store does it have fruit flavors is its citrusy is it minty not nuts as a very common

called punch bar never heard of this it look pretty good so I just picked it up it was $18 pretty pricey 225 milligrams of cannabis in it it's a chocolate so again it's going to be pretty potent and as the name suggests as well so I have Adam here sorry about the steady we're just on our way to the [ __ ] City Walk and I thought it'd be a great time to do a review so I'm only going to about 1/4 this is packaging ended pretty nice graphic design on there I'm open it this is the inside right here like without jeans pretty nice and a times divided so into 90 little pieces each piece has 25 milligram of cannabis in it Oh am I amita for it that's about I'm family guy ah so that's 35 milligrams right there then we'll be eating Adam is only if any and five milligrams as well so we're going to split this or we might have to do have to have one footed so this is what it looks like on the inside it's the divided into nine pieces 25 milligrams each piece it looks three nice and it has the graphic on the chocolate smells like chocolate no weed so we'll see what the taste is like and we'll tune back in and in about 30 minutes 45 minutes or whenever we hit the free night shelters by the way so here's the chocolate again we divide it into three pieces already I'm late one of these three pieces so let me be ingesting 75 milligrams it takes a lot like we so everyone like edibles that is like weed this wouldn't be the right edible for you like I said before you shouldn't be eating edibles if you don't like to take the weeds but yeah this tastes a lot like we listen in and like 30 to 45 minutes we'll be back see you guys later thank you so YouTube so I'm chillin as you can see I'm pretty stable the facts I would rate them like a 10 nah not it's not even 10 for the monitor well maybe a 10 yeah the time is it got me pretty good more like it was 50 wise very potent as you can see am i dead give away the fruits on here my boy Adam a chair sitting so I would recommend this like a 10 for beginners like a little square would be good maybe even half of that square for beginners intermediate it's like a square and a half and expert like Adams already would realize maybe six of the square is maybe pretty expensive in my opinion $18.00 but it will give you three doses 81 and okay hi so I rate this instead based on the amounts I ate not on not on us too high I experienced the pretty potent hires I'm saying for the mountain ight so I'm a pretty guy 135 pounds by 5 so 5 5 so pretty yeah just not dropped in the comments below which you want me to review next any edibles

back to another episode of life above the clouds your guide to elevated eating with a new cannabis feste every week so we have a set change I just moved if you care spring is officially here so I wanted to make something light and fresh so this week we are making cannabis lemon bars I love desserts with lemon in them because I think that the tartness of lemon is perfect with the sweetness of your dessert so lemon bars are one of my favorite things to eat and make because they're actually really easy to make we are going to start by making our crust in a medium sized mixing bowl combine your melted regular butter and cannabis butter with the sugar then add in the flour and salt and mix until it's just combined press the dough evenly into an 8x8 pan I have already greased mine and lined it with parchment paper then bake for 10 minutes at 350 degrees while it's cooling we are going to make the lemon filling first mix your lemon zest and sugar in a large mixing bowl then add your lemon juice the flour baking powder and finally the eggs mix until it's well combined and all the sugar is dissolved now pour your lemon mixture over the crust and bake at 350 degrees for another 25 minutes or until the filling has set remove it from the oven and allow it to cool completely before dusting it with powdered sugar and cutting it into 12 equal pieces and our lemon bars are already ready that was so fast and easy wasn't it I like to dust mine myth powdered sugar before I cut them and then after I cut them because you really just want a nice coating of powdered sugar [Music] mmm-mmm-mmm the crust is nice and crisp when the lemon filling is still kind of gooey but it reminds me of 11 starbursts I feel like I could eat a million of them but I will try not to I hope you liked this episode of life above the clouds be sure to subscribe to my channel if you haven't already and give this video a thumbs up and share it with all your friends and don't forget to check out my new patreon page if you want to send over a cup of sugar or a bag of flour I would really appreciate it thanks again for watching bye guys", "EvSRFG4Wg6M": "[Music] [Music] you", "GVmeX2dsOLk": "bouton oh hi welcome back to the cannabis sommelier I'm your host Andrew Friedman thanks for joining me for a cooking with cannabis slash cocktailing with cannabis recipe depending on if you'd like to put booze in this or not what are we gonna make an infamous fantastic heartwarming drink hot chocolate or in Nigeria known as chocolate tea the first known record of hot chocolate is about 2,500 to 3,000 years ago in Maya the Aztecs started drinking an amazing cocoa drink that was then popularized in Europe and since then has gone through so many adaptations there's a great saying that I once heard in Mexico that love without kisses is like hot chocolate without cheese I've yet to try hot chocolate with cheese but that statement resonated with me so let's learn how we make a little bit of infused hot chocolate it's very very simple as you could assume we need some chocolate so I have about 50 grams of baker's chocolate semi-sweet I'm just gonna throw right into my pan and then I have a Terry's chocolate orange this is a great Canadian favorite I pretty sure it's only sold in Canada in the UK and the most fun is you whack it and unwrap it so I think the ticket is to smack it and take it open and you've got this hilarious chocolate flavoured chocolate orange and I'm gonna have one of those in there today because that's what I would like to do then we're going to pour the milk in and we're gonna start on low and we're gonna increase to about a media low medium heat and get this to a nice simmer get everything together and then once it's at Heat I have a little bit of infused coconut oil that I'm going to use but we're also going to be using the infused whipped cream check out that card now so that you can prep that beforehand to put on top so this will be a double infusion but we'll put it on the stove on a low heat and slowly increase now alright so you can see the mixture is all falling together it's starting to look like what we know and love as hot chocolate so this is our time that will take our dosed coconut oil and we'll add that right in remember always figure out your own dosage my recommendations are never perfect it's just specific for me so luckily there is some milk fat in there there's some fat in the chocolate so it should help the coconut oil disappear so that we don't see any of those little oil floaties that you may have found if you've been trying to infuse or create drinks with your own tinctures at home so we'll let that sit for another maybe two minutes we'll bring it to a simmer and then it's ready to go into our cup and be topped with our infused whipped cream so our chocolate our milk everything is beautifully emulsified we've got this wonderful smelling lovely beverage and now again a test of my skills can I get it into the mug in one pour there we go I definitely could have made more didn't realize how big of a mug I had and we'll put that back here and then I have some wonderful infused whipped cream like I mentioned go watch that video so you can learn to make infused whipped cream easy fantastic way to dose any beverage or dessert thinking the video we did peaches and cream there we go wonderful little dose of use with cream chocolate and then what is hot chocolate without a couple marshmallows and a couple pieces of white chocolate on top just for fun and there you have it infuse hot chocolate to infusions coconut oil and with the wonderful infused whipped cream add anything you want to the top it's wonderful with a little bit of candy cane crush very festive make sure to LIKE comment share and subscribe and until next time Cheers what's my name what's my name the cannabis Somali yay", "_1su4Zt65is": "hey y'all hi here away of goodies and Friday right Friday it's Valentine's Day always so sweet um if you're in love congratulations if you not in love congratulations um today we're gonna make some chocolate some chocolate and some chocolate-covered strawberries it's supposed to be a really quick video we're just kind of gonna get into it so I have these molds and I want to show these first cuz they're so cute we got these from Dollar Tree these are roses and then these are some cute little hearts for a dollar okay um we have some strawberries here it's winter so they're not that sweet but chocolate is gonna fix that and then this is Oh Oh show my little test one that's my little test it's so cute okay we have here some vanilla candy wafers and we're gonna mix it melt this down with some coconut oil this is about one cup of wafers in like a tablespoon little over a tablespoon of coconut oil we're trying to make these micro do mousse and then we have a half a cup of chocolate chips semi-sweet chocolate chips we're gonna melt that down with some of our wax infuse can of butter it's a little less than a tablespoon of peanut butter again we're trying to microdose we don't want to make them too strong but if you want to make them strong for yourself go on ahead and then we have some food coloring here as I would definitely recommend gel food coloring one if you can afford it and if the store has it in stock which our Walmart's so they'll never have nothing stuck okay and of course we have a pot of water here to get a little double broiler double boil going okay you ready baby all right I gotta ask are you in love yeah oh she's in love okay I'm in love too I think ready let's do this so we're gonna start with our vanilla wafers so I'm gonna do my double boil this way just because I already put it in the measuring cup and I'm gonna get something to stir okay Sterne still stirring still melting but you don't want to rush have to take your time melt it melt it now let's move that over all right now I'm just gonna separate them so that I can make them pretty close [Music] let's add some color let's do obviously stir stir stir Oh I don't want to add a lot of food coloring cuz you know you get that terrible cheese so it's gonna be more pink than red but with gel food coloring you know it would probably bring well we got some pink I don't know I want to do green let's go yeah I like oh yeah I'm just like okay add as much as you want if you don't care about that food color and taste now let's get these in some moves let's do some green card and we will do green robes oh we sprayed these if you can't tell obviously just makes it easy to get these damn things out okay we'll do some pink and then I'll throw the rest of oK we've got all these in there in the mold so now we're gonna put them in the freezer or the fridge whatever it don't really matter but I'm gonna put mine in the freezer cuz I'm a patient all right so I almost forgot you're supposed to do this fancy trick here to get all the air out so our molds are in the freezer you know to harden and now we're gonna melt down our chocolate and our butter these are for chocolate covered strawberries so yeah we know you got a boo thing you wanna surprise give us some chocolate-covered strawberries or if you just want to make them by yourself that's okay - all right that looks good all right let's take that off okay let's do it I've heard so if I have some more white chalk white vanilla wafers Oh which I do have but I don't feel like that one any more down then we could do a fancy little drizzle on it or if you have sprinkles or nuts whatever fancy as strawberries yeah they make perfect gifts which we know first thing yes oh yes we dipped it we made these before and like last year for a friends housewarming yes and they went over very well of course he didn't share them with the guests he hid them away until the guests left what I don't blame them hey good morning yes it is now you don't even need to go to the grocery store and buy those expensive truck will come strawberries y'all cuz it would make the man wax paper and then spray it with a little nonstick spray just for easy removal so we're gonna put these in the fridge and let them Harden alright and there you have it super easy infuse chocolate hearts and roses for your lady or your man or whatever or yourself or your person or your home either way if I gonna be high and impress okay they're so cute and that's about it wait I do want to say baby rushing me I know but I just have to say the same thing I say every year on Valentine's Day Valentine's Day is not just if

it ok and that's it thanks for watching and don't forget to subscribe alright peace [Music]", "fHlIHqkl21U": "[Music] welcome back two weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary our job is to help you guys determine which edibles at your dispensary when you see that big glass case there that refrigerator full of a bunch of different products full but then bunch of different expensive prices and you're not sure which ones are worth your money which ones are actually gonna get you high and which ones are a bunch of duds that's what we're here for and today we are going to look at a brand new product a product that says it's been around since 2008 and we are taking a look at hubby's edibles their milk chocolate bar in this sparkly iridescent packaging here it claims that it's three doses with a minimum of a hundred and thirty group milligrams of THC in there so pretty clean packaging this cost $12 at the dispensary but I believe I got it for a $2 discount so got it only for 10 bucks so you know about average for 130 milligram an\u00edbal and it came highly recommended from the bartender they said they sell a lot of these so let's take a look and see how it fits I do like on the back that the nutrition information says that the serving size is one full bar yet over here it says it's three doses hmm curious I'm gonna follow the nutrition information and not the doses information but as always you guys should consult with your bud tender and with whatever the dosage recommendation is if you are not a seasoned edible eater make sure that you do not overdo it and always stick with whatever the dosage suggestion is me I'm a pro and my job is to make sure you get the whole product and know that how it's all gonna taste and how it's all gonna feel so here we go a pretty plain looking chocolate bar there comes in a bunch of different little rivulets let's uh Milty and the sparkly package is sparkly on the inside as well let's give it a taste that's not bad that's not bad at all there's definitely a slight weed taste to it um especially when you first bite into it but the chocolate is rich its creamy it sort of overpowers that weed taste we can give another bite here but that first bite was certainly far from bad even verging on on okay passes the taste test again not wonderful but for an edible pretty good however guys however gonna taste does not really matter in the grand scheme of things the most important part when it comes to the a DeBoer of you is its how is its gonna make me feel and for that you're gonna have to wait two hours or you're not gonna have to wait two hours you're just gonna have to wait a couple seconds I'll have to wait two hours and I'll come back to you guys and let you know how I'm feeling thank you so much for watching and see you in just a bit [Music] hi guys welcome back two weeks it's been Oh two hours here since I had the puppies edibles 130 milligrams no chocolate bar and it's right about in that sweet spot right about what I hope for it to be not too high you know not outrageously high but definitely noticeably high maybe about a six on the high scale and it feels like it's just about peach or peak maybe a couple of minutes ago so I'm pretty pleased with the experience so far again it was affordable at twelve dollars but I got a discount for ten so in that regard it's great as well right about in the price you would want it to be I definitely think I'll be picking up some more hobbies in the future to give them some reviews just because this first one seemed to be right about what I would hope for it to be again not out not incredible about about a six after about two hours so right in the ballpark of where you would hope it would be and that's going to do it for this review here on weeds guys we will see you on the next one peace", "F7pphiwz_LE": "[Music] hi there buds let's talk about my outfit really fast i bought this cardigan when i was like incredibly stoned asos was having like a semi-annual type sale and a lot of [ __ ] was parents and i saw this and there was like a video of a model wearing it was a nice tall guy and he kept swaying his arms and it looked so neat and i was like oh that's fashion like i need that and then i bought it and it came in and i was like what the hell was i thinking like how much did i smoke before i decided this was something that i needed in my [ __ ] life because now i'm highly embarrassed i've had this sitting in my closet for at least a year it's even got fringe like all the way around i've had this just like sitting there and i'm like what the hell like when am i ever gonna wear this and so i was like you know what i'm just gonna have to i'm just gonna have to make myself wear it so today i was like oh i want something new to wear something spicy so this is what came out you guys i'm not gonna lie though as ugly as it is i do have an amazing time waving my arms around in it and watching all the things just move like it has such great movement like this would be something great to go dancing or something i don't know i kind of i kind of enjoy it but anyways i hope you guys are all having a great day today i have something new that i've never tried before i saw this at the dispensary it's weed bubble gum i'm like you guys know i'm a sucker for anything new at the dispensary that's an edible i'm like i've never tried weed gum before and that sounds amazing this is bubble gum flavored by a company called joy gum it has 10 milligrams of thc per serving and there's 10 pieces so 100 milligrams of thc and i thought we would try it out i mean hopefully it tastes good hopefully the effects are really long-lasting i love the idea of using a gum as an edible because you can just sit there and chew on it like all day long maybe have like a gradual release of thc all day that's what i'm hoping for i've not smoked today so i can get a full feel of how this gum is going to affect me so i'm ready to dive in let's get into this [Music] open it up pretty easy just to peel off packaging [Music] it smells like straight up bubbles like [Music] there's no other wheaties at all you cannot tell that this is infused at all it just smells like bubbles it actually smells like really good bubble gum like almost like um i'm trying to think of the name of it the one that comes in the tape fruit by the foot oh it was at this moment that he knew he [ __ ] up oh my god my grandpa used to buy this for me when i was little and i used to just have pockets full of candy and the bubble tape bubba take i don't remember what it was called the tape like gum somebody out there knows exactly what the [ __ ] i'm talking about and i probably will be able to just google a picture and put it right here what i'm talking about but that's what this smells like anyways [Music] oh my god it has their logo on the go hope that focuses it says joy gum right there that's cute and on the back of that it has a little thc emblem just to show you that it's weedy all right i'm excited about this like they're super cute they smell good so we'll see we're gonna just do one first just for a little taste test and then i'm gonna chew this entire package all in one sitting because you guys know i like to i like to go boss to the walls cheers oh my god [Music] the taste is so familiar it reminds me of chicklets that gum in the 90s that was like it came in the yellow package and they were super duper tiny that's what this tastes like if i try really really really hard i can kind of take some weaniness but like you really have to focus on it overall first impressions the gum tastes incredibly good i'm gonna go ahead and put another piece in and another pretty soon if this is actually effective this will be a really cool way of getting some and with it being 10 milligrams it's like not too much for each piece you could easily just have like a piece of gum before you go to work and then be in like a little bit of a better mood than you normally would be without being like super stoned or repaired i like that but i like that they give you 10 pieces in a pack so that if you are like me and you want to chew like 100 milligrams of thc you can i wonder if it'll blow bubbles like i wonder if it's like a bubble gum let's see i don't ever think this is bubblegum but i'm gonna try again [Music] the texture of this gum is like one of those gums that kind of melts in your mouth it becomes really really really soft because all gums get soft obviously but you know how some gums are like they damn near feel like they're gonna disappear in your mouth that's how this one feels it's very very thin i don't mind that at all all right i mean i'm at 30 milligrams i mean it's only been like what like i've probably been recording like five minutes but i'm not afraid of 100 milligrams at all like i feel like that's not going to be bad for me so [Music] that's the rest of the gum [Music] i'm so sorry if this smacking loses about my god i feel like i'm spitting i'm really surprised about extreme this much come because it's like a lot i'm not gonna lie though it's pleasure like it tastes so [ __ ] good i'll be honest with you guys i don't feel anything yet like nothing yet nothing oh my god i'm gonna knock that over don't feel nothing yet but normally it takes edibles about 20 minutes for me to really build something oh my god like talking with those i'm going to do my heart maybe i fit in my cheek while i talk normally it takes about 20 minutes for like an edible to affect me so i guess i'm gonna sit here and shoot my gum circle the web a little bit probably get on my phone and um i'll give you guys a status update on how i feel after chewing 100 milligrams of thc [Music] [Music] all right it's been about 10 minutes and i already feel it like i definitely feel a little something my body feels relaxed i'm starting to feel relaxed like my mood is starting to feel relaxed i feel like this is gonna be a good one you guys like i'm really excited because i i don't feel like i normally feel effects like this quickly or this strongly i would say that i feel the same level as i did after drinking that whole 10 milligram soda already right now so [Music] i'll be back in like another probably 20 minutes 30 minutes and we'll see how it is [Music] i also noticed on the package that's zero calories so there's that and it's made in aurora colorado so it's like a locally made thing which is me [Music] edibles i feel like sometimes make me out of breath or maybe it's just all this to me regardless i'm out of breath then i'll be back [Music] i'm gonna be honest you guys i feel sick like i feel queasy i feel dizzy this isn't good like it doesn't feel good like i feel dizzy like i don't feel good at all and i feel like i'm sweating a little bit but i don't want to take off my cute little tassels because these are so much fun but like i don't i don't know i i don't know i don't know [Music] i don't know i don't like it like it's just like i don't know like i seriously feel like the room is spinning and i don't like that and i feel hot like i almost feel like i'm gonna get sick like i'm gonna get like like i'm gonna throw up or something but i know i'm not going to throw up like i didn't eat anything and like i'm in my mouth like i'm not gonna throw up i'm not gonna lie [Music] i'm just gonna tell myself this too shall pass and do few breathing exercises [Music] we're just going to power through this and see how it is in another 20 minutes or so [Music] also you guys i'm feeling a lot better like 100 better i don't feel dizzy at all i will say i do kind of feel like i don't know it's not shortness of breath it's almost like do you guys know when you get super stoned and you feel like something's almost sitting on your chest that's how i feel right [Music] now [Music] so it's like it's not like the best feeling in the world but like overall i'm gonna say like it's not bad so far like not horrible we had a little moment we breathed through that now we're in the little chest weirdness feeling but i'm starting to feel the like mental effects like i'm starting to feel strong a little bit which is kind of nice because i feel like edibles like they kind of go weird for me like some of them will affect me and only my body like i'll feel tingly all over like whatever and then some will affect me mentally and when they affect me mentally they affect me mentally like like really slowly so i'm starting to feel those effects a little bit like i feel a little spacey very relaxed still don't focus on my breathing just because it's so weird how when you get stoned you really focus on your breathing and then you're like i don't know particularly when you get that feeling and i know other stoners out there comment below if you've ever had that feeling because i know i know other people and i have it now i do feel tingly in my arms too my arms feel really deeply all right i'll be back probably in another 20 minutes or so again for another update i don't even know how long i'm going to update this because i think i'm going to shoot this stuff all [ __ ] day long because i want to say it was 15 there's no price on here but i thought i think it was fifteen dollars and if that's okay fifteen dollars for a full day all day so i hope that it lasts the full day and i'll see you guys around for whenever the next update is i'll be sure to let you guys know how long it's been i thought right now i would say probably i'll be back in another like 40 minutes or so but i don't know once you start to get to this level of your stone that's not the word that i was trying to go for once you get to this level of your high i feel like things get unpredictable like you tend to do things and you sometimes don't and it's just you know what i mean so i'll be back when i'm back and i'll let you know how long it's been [Music] it looks so much further down [Music] i work so much better as bubble gum after you really chew it for like a good hour or so because then it gets even softer and it works so much better bubbles anyways now we'll be back in like 20 minutes [Music] i feel like i should just fly off with these i'm like i looked at the mess i was like getting off here and i was like i want my transition would just be like and then when i come back i can just fly [Music] back what would you call this look you guys like what the hell would you call this for some reason it gives me like very mariachi vibes but it's like i don't know why i think it's because it kind of reminds me of a pinata i feel like i look like a pinata like i seriously feel like i could be on dancing with the stars with this outfit like what was i thinking i'm back it is now about 4 p.m i've been chewing on this gum all day long i haven't even taken it out for a break like i've some water with it but that's about it i will say the flavor of the gum it's like the flavor of a gum that's lost its flavor if that makes sense like it has that like mmm there used to be flavor here but there's not anymore and it tastes kind of like blend that's how it tastes right now the gum definitely shrinks over time i don't know if i'm just like accidentally swallowing it or something but like it definitely felt like a huge wada gum in my mouth before now feels like just like a slightly oversized piece of gum [Music] it does blow bubbles better now now to the effects i will say that i think that it's still effective like i still feel slightly stoned right now [Music] i don't feel like this was a frame frame i do feel like it was at first like within the first like hour it was really really really strong after like the first hour and a half like two hours kind of like a little bit so like i still feel like if i like chew on it a lot and actually like focus on chewing it i do feel like a little bit like i do get a little bit of like a revamp of the high like i do think that this is to in order to get the effects you do have to like sit there and chew and chew and chew and chew and chew because if you just let sit in your mouth i don't feel like it does as much for some reason would i buy this again yes would i use it all in one setting no because i felt like that wasn't necessary i feel like i probably would have gotten a lot better of an experience off of this with using half of it and i probably would have felt probably the same i would i mean like that's just my guess i feel like this was a little overkill for what it is particularly because like the effects don't last long like or like longer i mean they do a little bit because it's a gum and you have to chew it to get the thc to come out it is like an extended release in that aspect but that thc actually goes pretty fast i feel like like i feel like you get 70 of the effects of it probably within the first two hours and then after that you're just getting like a little twin to look the last thirty percent i'm definitely gonna chew it through bedtime but i don't expect any different results if i do have any different results i'll definitely check in and let you guys know but overall i would say i recommend it um for 15 you can split this up in probably like three or four different um sessions and that would make it like a little bit more affordable and not so expensive because for a one-time treat 15 is a lot but i'll definitely try this again i wonder if they have different flavors i would be interested in a mint um the bubble gum like it just loses its flavor and then it just kind of is like and i feel like with minty gums when they lose their flavor it's not as bad if you know what i mean um anyways thank you guys so much for watching this video if you like it give it a thumbs up leave a comment down below let me know if you've ever tried joy gum if you've seen this in your dispensary if you're gonna try it now let me know because am i the only person who just gets enticed by all the little things in the dispensary i literally feel like a kid in a cannabis candy store every time i go in there and there's like something new and i'm like anyways thank you guys so much for watching and i'll see you guys around for whatever shiny activity or video i come up with for next time and hopefully i'll be in a better outfit than this or if this is your definition of good then hopefully i keep this bar hi thank you so much for watching bye guys", "kC0PG3GqVMo": "thank you too so today I'm going to show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what you solo today don't forget to check me out on instagram at the NJ chef don't forget to

Friedman thanks for joining me for another episode cannabis edible reviews cannabis edibles are a brand-new category to the Canadian legal recreational cannabis market and exploring all these new goodies has been really interesting although I haven't found as many savoury products as I'd hoped I'd see I have found some sweets and really monitoring how much they cost and the quality of ingredients going in is what I'm here for I'm not gonna speak to any of the intoxicating effects because the dosage is quite low and if you've watched any of the other canvas reviews I don't actually ever talk about how the intoxication makes me feel the best rule of thumb is that cannabis will make you intoxicated and to know your dose and start low and go slow but you should be safe no matter what eating a 10 milligram edible on that note but I'm not a doctor so take my advice that way anyways onto the edible what do we have brown bag nice descries is the cheapest edible I've bought so far and it is the chewy Oh wowie milk chocolate just straight-up milk chocolate and it has you note the milligrams ten milligrams THC and ten milligrams CBD so that is pretty awesome twenty milligrams in here and I paid five dollars and fifty cents for it so the cheapest edible uh purchased with the most amount of camera noise in it we'll put up the math for what that is dollar amount equivalent to milligrams so these balanced chocolates are made with ten milligrams of THC and ten milligrams CD per piece each piece can be easily split into two squares enjoy with friends recommend starting with just one square then waiting to feel the effects before having more while you wait you could invent backstories for strangers try not to think about capybaras watch clouds for more info visit us at channel alley so that's pretty you know that's I like the bit of marketing and brand they present it I like the color I like the logo this feels kind of like the most cannabis edible thing that I have purchased yet out of all my reviews you know from what we've seen in the legacy market so it feels it feels familiar it feels comfortable I like that Nutrition Facts eighty calories fats five grams three grams saturated nine grams of carbs eight grams of sugar one gram of protein and everything else doesn't really matter and unlike our other edibles it does not say how much the equivalent of this edible is in dried canvas that was a kind of confusing oh yes it does the equivalent of 1.1 grams of dried cannabis and this package weighs 16 grams so whatever that's worth I guess it's equivalent to dry weight is equivalent to whole weight of the edible still confuse by that keep out of reach of children so there's chocolate sugar whole milk powder cocoa butter unsweetened chocolate soy lecithin natural vanilla extract canvas extract contains go this way very very simple ingredients one two three four five six seven eight nine and you know everything on here there is no so that's always nice let's open it up let's see how it is again I like how it could hang to this is uh this is the nicest laid out one here's our duty seal will rip through our Alberta Duty seal on our $5 and 50 gram 20 milligram edible was look like oh it's you know little bar smelling here first smells like any milk chocolate you would get it Easter not Joey wowie okay so I actually like the branding also on the edible it kind of reminds me of Willy wonka-esque it's pretty cool easily split into two bars very easy and let's see we'll warm it a little we'll do our chocolate tasting and see our assessment of quality but you know for the this is the best value edible we found five dollars five dollars and fifty cents for twenty milligrams almost seems up propria it's getting there that's definitely the trace direction that we need to work towards as far as the chocolate goes it's not very fragrant there's not anything no interesting fruits or berries Roma's hopping out of this chocolate its milk chocolate it's it smells like normal chocolate bar quality milk chocolate that you would I can't get it Easter I mean chocolate bunny yeah what can you say it tastes like chocolate it didn't say it was extract I can taste the idea of cannabis in there to be very very honest with you cannabis extract yeah so I think it's a full spectrum oil on this um cuz I can as I let it settle and the chocolate mr. Speers I can taste cannabis 100% so it's it's there and I always wonder if I could taste the cannabis is there really only that little milligrams in my edible so I can taste the cannabis now the chocolates gone and does taste like you know cannabis extract full spectrum cannabis extract that's not particularly refined let's have one more piece since the videos five is fifty seconds can see me eat it all might as well again I can't smell any canvas off coming off of it but I could taste it okay so where we have my overall impression is it's pretty good for the cost this is the absolute best buy you can make we know it's our cheapest milligrams so far where we sit as this video is recorded February 4 2020 so there's great value in the actual milligrams that you're getting the chocolate itself is definitely nothing to write home about you are paying for the canvas ingredients in this the packaging the distribution I think it's a pretty good option especially for the price you don't have much to expect from the actual food ingredients I would say though that tasting the cannabis in there for some people could be off-putting for others it could remind them that there actually is cannabis in it so interested to see I will give the Chihuahua milk chocolate a 7 out of 10 this is uh this is a good buy the food ingredients are nothing to write home about there's a good value for your cannabis $2 value and I liked the branding for what that's worth so thank you so much for watching I'll be make sure to LIKE comment share and subscribe as always share all of your favorite edibles that you've purchased in the market your favorite cannabis I'll make sure to look for them I'm in Alberta and I'm always getting new products here thank you so much for watching until next time Cheers what's my name what's my name somali yay", "J_zkLylv5u0": "[Music]", "bwbZTN4fMGM": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'll be showing you how to infuse starbursts so delicious and surprisingly was one of the easiest edibles i've ever made and i feel like i'm going to make these many times in the future they turned out so well [Music] to make these starbursts here's what you're going to need some starburst candy i wish i could have had the all pink kind but we don't sell them in canada so i just got the original infuse coconut oil and optionally you can also use a concentrate or extract to make them extra strong and some lecithin to help with absorption first i have the top part of my double boiler and then i'm going to peel the wrapper off of some starbursts and place them in the bowl i use 30 pieces here but the amount you use doesn't matter too much the recipe is very forgiving then you're gonna heat up a pot to a light boil and place your double boiler container thing on top and then using the spatula you're going to use to mix everything together add a scoop of some lecithin and then mix that in they do take quite a while to melt so just keep an eye on them and for the first five minutes or so they probably won't melt that much so you can pretty much just leave them be but then after five minutes when they start to melt like this um just keep stirring them and watching them until they melt all the way down then once everything is pretty much melted like this we can add our coconut oil so i'm going to be adding one tablespoon of coconut oil but you can add for this amount of starburst up to three tablespoons of coconut oil and to make it stronger i'm also going to be adding some concentrate now we just have to mix everything together so i'm having some trouble getting the starburst and the oil to emulsify together you can see um the oil kind of just doesn't really blend into it at all so i'm going to grab a whisk and see if that'll help us emulsify a little bit better so using the whisk aggressively actually turned out very well everything mixed together and it worked better than i expected honestly now i'm just going to put my starburst mixture onto a baking pan that is covered in waxed paper and then i'm just going to place another sheet of wax paper on top and kind of roll it and shape it out to the thickness i want in the end i feel like i wish i would have made it a little bit thicker so it would have been the exact same thickness of actual starburst but next time i'll do that i guess and then i just use this sharp utensil to kind of just shape it so i could have nice corner edges and then i placed it in the fridge now while i'm waiting for it to cool in the fridge i'm going to heat up my double boiler again because um i don't want to waste any of the starburst and the coconut oil mixture that's left in the pot so i'm going to make a little drink out of it so i have a whole video on how to do this and to be honest that video is going to give you a much tastier result than this one because this is just like a little makeshift one i did and i'll post the link of how to make that drink below pretty much you're just going to add some water and heat it up so you can get all the mixture combined and then you're going to add a drink mix to it and then cool it and serve it over ice but check out the video i have on how to make an infused starburst drink because it's like literally one of the most delicious drinks i've ever had and you can put quite a bit of coconut oil in there and you can't taste it which is very surprising considering how much i put in it okay so now that our drink is made and our starburst has cooled down a bit i actually left mine in the fridge a little bit too long it was about a half an hour and i felt like it was a little bit too hard for me to cut easily so i just took it out of the fridge for five ten minutes until it was ready to be cut so i'm just going to start by cutting these little edges on the side which i'll probably just snap on while i'm cutting and then i'm going to cut all of these into squares after i cut them i realized that i feel like the size was not accurate to the size of a starburst so when i make these next time i'm going to actually place a starburst on there and measure it out now they're all done so i'm just going to throw them into their little container and that's it they are ready to eat [Music] these turned out so well i'm so so happy with them this is probably going to be my go-to instead of gummies now they just just everything is amazing thank you guys so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thanks so much guys have a wonderful day [Music] you", "6mbH-SwT0pA": "I'm gonna tell you by the time I almost killed my dog hi welcome to antle's anything show and today I'm gonna tell you about the time I got my dog stone yeah so let's get into it you guys all know Panda she's adorable wait should we get her in here I feel like we should get her in here panda panda she never listens to me so the story goes as follows it was last week panda was home alone normally she acts like a sweet little angel but this time she wasn't acting so sweet and Dan came home from work to discover a dog laying on a couch not willing to get up to greet him rappers everywhere uh a trash strewn about everywhere and the remnants of a wrapper of a Snoop Dogg dark chocolate marijuana bar that I purchased in Colorado two months ago she also ate all of my vegan beef jerky strips which really pisses me off because those are very expensive and it's like Panda you're not even vegan you don't even eat it before we get into the store even further I just want to say I did not leave damn kept saying I left my chocolate bar out I left it out I didn't leave out I left it away where it's been sitting for months where I've always had a weak chocolate bar always sitting up on that shelf the Shelf is taller than her it's like in its packaged in a box the box was ajar but like gee is still I mean she's never gone over there so Fleur everyone's [ __ ] calls DSS or whatever ASPCA I did not leave it out but anyway he gets home he realizes what she's eaten but wait drop the dark chocolate stop seek for dogs and so is too much THC so she normally is obsessed with him so he walks in and she won't even like get up to say hello and I guess she just like couldn't even walk she couldn't even like walk like you know you first get high to get like a really high she couldn't even walk and she was just like all [ __ ] up look tall stone so I'm freaking out I'm like we gotta take her to the hospital so Dan takes her to the hospital I guess she like shits on his legs a little bit on the way or something I don't know she's in the hospital and apparently as she's sitting there in the waiting room she's like looking side to side like tripping balls like any little noise she's just like huh-huh wobbling when she's walking just like having a really bad trip or maybe she was having an amazing trip finally no she's like do I tell them what happens or joy Lyman no [ __ ] that you gotta tell them and I guess they like giggled I'm like oh that happens all the time and people usually are honest with us about it apparently it happens all the time so we're not horrible dog parents but they took her in they uh what else he's been fighting on remember they took her in they took blood work they did an x-ray of her stomach to make sure like [ __ ] was moving I guess and then they were gonna give her charcoal which like absorbs all the [ __ ] and keep her overnight chi-ching chi-ching chi-ching so um [Music] anything for our girl so Oh God so anyway he admits her whatever I'm at work I don't even oh I'm like not around he picks her up the next day we have the reports and they printed out of like what she did overnight and it's really funny because it's like 10 o'clock p.m. like patient feels this seems much better like 3 o'clock feed her some food she ate well it's like this [ __ ] can eat she can eat all day like nothing stops if she is a tank and then on the report it was like non-toxic amount of THC or chocolate so basically we didn't have to bring her in but what would you have done like I don't know this was the first time it ever happened I think if it was just the chocolate we would have just monitored her and if it was just the weed would've just monitored her but I think all of it together and like she seemed so [ __ ] up that it was just like a scary so we brought him whatever the money is spent it's done now I can't buy a house because we spent all this money on her dog Hey what you gonna do at least we'll be homeless with her dog you know and then people will give us money because people love to give homeless people a dog's money hashtag you can't afford rent and camp for his dog down the street so hey was I talking about oh so when he picks her up they're like she's fine and they're like no do you have a gravel driveway or gravel road where you live and Dan's like no nothing they would like that wouldn't have a driveway like okay because there's rocks in her stomach dan was like that's weird okay well I don't know she's home like a day or two Dan's on the computer and he's like panda and she's not there so he's like honey what's she doing she's being naughty so he finds her over by our house plant-eating the little pebbles that are around the house lately you know decorative garden pebbles eating them little pebble rocks munching go away keep in mind this dog we got her she had no teeth they're like numb down to the ground and the vet was like what does she can chew and how I don't know so she obviously loves tea rocks and she's probably been doing it for a long time and also keep in mind that earlier in the week before she ate this weed she had gotten worms in her butt a tapeworm not heartworm tapeworm and they're like oh it could be from eating larva of whatever and we're like what the [ __ ] is she has no fleas like what could this be she ate the rocks on top of soil that plant tends to get black flies which is why we don't put water in that's like dining in her house so but certainly as she got the worms that's definitely why she had the rocks in her stomach and up until about two days ago she'd been [ __ ] out literal rocks like she was [ __ ] in the house cuz like in midnight cause her stomach was [ __ ] up still she wasn't like [ __ ] in the house normally but you know when he gotta go you gotta go but it was like the cleanup was easy because it was not poop it was rocks this chick tore her butthole up pooping up rocks she loves them she [ __ ] loves them so $1,300 later pandas cured but she still has pica so we need to address that but that's the story of how our dog got into some [ __ ] last week and she got super stoned and that's basically at hide your weed chocolates hide your ox-hide you trash hide your vegan beep your key because pandas come into town well that's the story there it is hope you guys liked it and thank you for watching this episode of ant does anything show see you next time and tell the people you're alright you can't even look at me can you", "lK2pxyo3R8Y": "hi there I'm Mandy Lee the host of try this and try this is an educational show that is all about cannabis and cannabis products every Thursday we share with you how to videos and product reviews and much more to ultimately help you get the most value from our favorite plant and today we have for you for tips on how you can get the most value from cannabis tinctures so let's get to it let's dive in and let's try this now tinctures are extracted cannabinoids which are mixed into either an alcohol glycerin or coconut oil solution and they're ideal for people who are using cannabis for medicinal reasons or for people who are new to cannabis as well there's a few reasons for this one is that they're administered via a syringe so you're able to easily and accurately dose yourself in really small increments because you can basically count each drop as you administer it also the tinctures come in many non psychoactive options and they also carry little to no smell and involve no vapor or smoke now the most popular and beneficial way of taking them is sublingually so the solution is absorbed in the body through the oral mucus all and to do this you use a dropper and you place the cannabis solution right underneath your tongue you hold it there for about a minute before swallowing and then you will feel the effects typically in about fifteen to thirty minutes and the last you for about three to four hours this way of administering it the cannabinoids and the terpenes they're absorbed through the tissue lining into your bloodstream so this increases the bioavailability of the cannabinoids so if this is the method that you're interested in then here are four tips for you on how you can get the most value from cannabis tinctures now number one is specific cannabinoid options so when it comes to tinctures many people don't realize that there are many options pass the sativa indica and hybrid options that they're used to tinctures can be made with specific cannabinoids and some with different ratios of one two one three two one or twenty two one of a combination of cannabinoids to meet different patient's needs because each cannabinoid is known for helping to treat different symptoms and ailments and can cause different effects so you can find teachers that are in THC which is psychoactive CBD which is non psychoactive THC and CBD a which is the acid form of THC and CBD before it's exposed to heat and both of these are they're fairly new cannabinoids to be offered and studied their non psycho active but there are astounding results that have been discovered with patients who are using these cannabinoids for an assortment of different reasons number two is using whole plant tinctures from flower so here at green flower we tend to favor whole plant tinctures from flower as opposed to trim now the flowers are just the most cannabinoids and terpenoids aplan whereas the trim it doesn't have as many terpenes and it mostly has the cannabinoid THC in it so these types of tinctures they'll give you the fullest entourage effect from cannabis and provide you with the widest range of terpenes now the cannabinoids and terpenoids resides and with some trim only tinctures you just lose quite a bit of the medicinal value from this lack of a rich terpene profile so when entourage effect is present in many of these flower rich tinctures what happens is you have multiple cannabinoids and chirping that are present and they work together to enhance the medicinal value of each of their individual properties now number three is choosing alcohol extractions so we also tend to favor tinctures that are made from an alcohol extraction process since this process it's just the gentlest on the plant and so it keeps the terpenes more intact because some extraction processes they strip the terpenes from the cannabis and other ones like co2 break apart the bonds between the cannabis and the terpenes and then they reintroduce the terpenes then ultimately what we've seen is that when you keep the terpenes completely intact with the cannabis that's when you'll see the best benefits and the terpenes make the benefits of the cannabinoids even more effective in your system and they carry a bunch of medicinal value themselves as well now Alison Attell from treat well which is a leading cannabis tincture company here in California she said that with alcohol extractions she's seen that with her clients and patients that they're not building up a tolerance to the cannabis so they're able to use less cannabis to achieve the exact results that they need which is a really big plus number four is choose products with testing and proper labels so when you're purchasing tinctures there are a few that you want to make sure to look for and to favor you want to make sure that the bottle itself says how many total milligrams of THC and other cannabinoids are also present in it as well as how many milligrams are in each dropper otherwise you're not going to be able to accurately and safely dose yourself and then we also recommend checking the company's website before purchasing to make sure that the cannabis teacher that you're purchasing has been lab tested for

to review or talk about products if you don't like it you can do what now or if you're under 18 you can do what now you got to kick rocks not smoking blue so what's up welcome to my channel my name is michie michelle mc269 upload on mondays wednesdays randomly on other days i do crappy comedy and i review smoke tons of candles because i'm a medical canvas patient here in florida also building a shipping container home so if any of that's your bag subscribe assist to my channel assistant if you're new here welcome and if you're all here welcome back and if you're a hater welcome you guys listen i haven't been able to get these listen i just wanted to get these the price point is great i mean it's it was a chocolate bar how could i not okay so i got the true gels pineapple oh oh it comes in a bag of five okay so these are not individually wrapped there's like here's like here's a dose here's the dose for me anyhow so what i am going to do is i'm just going to put these in here i'm probably going to do um i'd say 50 milligrams combined because i'm going to eat i'm not going gonna lie i'll eat more of the chocolate and then i'll eat the gummies so this is what they look like they're the pineapple let's go ahead and eat two of them real quick hold up i met you through these mmm i think they say thc on them but they're kind of soury oh my gosh tastes like pineapple that's just fire i'm gonna do three of these and two pieces of chocolate cause these are really good i can actually like eat these as candy truly could you just sell this recipe without the distillate it does not taste weedy at all i'm not even gonna i am not lying yeah i know my microwave agrees okay so the taste of those are it tastes like pineapple juice like celery oh my god i would eat these as regular candies all day every day those are delicious let's read the stats on these it says ingredients dislike cannabis oil sugar corn syrup water fruit pectin citric acid i knew that was in there and pineapple flavoring propylene glycol natural it's 10 milligrams this is 100 milligrams then 100 milligrams okay so this is the chocolate bar i wonder if it's going to be like willy wonka and i'm going to get a golden ticket oh i got there was dark and light chocolate i got light okay well so it's in a thing it's in a thing it's definitely child resistant i it's i can't even get it out so it's obviously idiot proof too oh okay it's got these little things okay okay my bad it was it wasn't that hard you push down on these things on the side and it comes out all right so here is your chocolate bar it says thc on it alright so it just looks like a chocolate bar and each of these are 10 milligrams and they say thc let's try them oh okay it was like two and a quarter pieces hmm this actually kind of tastes like dark chocolate oh good okay oh you don't taste any weed we're going to go ahead and make it i think 70 milliliters i got oh i got okay i'll see you guys in 45 minutes four to five minutes later you know i'm pretty sure the way that you can like see what batch these came from because it does have that scan code i didn't do that um if anyone's really interested i suppose that i could but i gotta tell you i'm feeling saucy oh man you know okay so i like to make my own edibles i i understand you know personally for me making them is just easier but for the price point if you were just like gonna go somewhere and you had to have see this is why these are good because you could take these and not have to worry about it if we make them ourselves we still have to worry about i suppose like if we were to take them anywhere out yeah i don't know and these are still showing that it's medication we i don't know i think there's a bonus to that also there's people who don't want to make it and there's people who just want to try it and not want to buy a whole thing a distillate so for that true leaf we thank you and those pineapples those are so tasty uh i don't know i did a combo i did a combo with the pineapple and the chocolate so i had pine chocolate and i would have to say that is quite the nice combo i'm not mad at you truly i'm not mad at you so yeah hi sorry i know i posted a video yesterday so you're getting one today there's that i just i actually picked this stuff up yesterday i was gonna post this video yesterday but i was like no so yeah

a friend of mine here his name is Holden he creates a hippie or high tea we're gonna get high on high tea yes hi I'm not smoking cannabis that is it we're not smoking do with it we eatin eat I'm not eating cannabis but it's a new thing they do it in cakes this is shops everywhere even in Lube you've got CBD Lube don't shout that too loud round here in 2018 California was the first US state to decriminalize the recreational use of cannabis ever since San Fran has led the way the guys are very excited all right entries first of all can you smell oh yeah Wow it's like a strong cannabis smell is it Oh golden right now Holden is a top chef here in San Francisco what everywhere in the world what is trying to do here is to pour cannabis into food use it like an alternative ingredients so it's not like that you come here and you have to get high how big do you think is gonna become as a food trend right now I'd say CVD is the largest food trend out there the annual US market for cannabis edibles already exceeds a billion dollars there are two types of infusion used in Holdens catering CBD known worldwide for having medicinal properties and THC the one that gets you high well you hear a lot about CBD CBD is not necessarily not psychoactive because if it wasn't psychoactive wouldn't have any of the health benefits that people are sort of proclaiming that it has so the CBC is very relaxing its relaxing at you high it won't get you high won't inebriate you th see it's it's an irritant and it's it's just like you know though the stuff your mom warned you about holden bikes all these food virgin so his customers can control their own buzz I make this little tincture here and one drop of this tincture is one milligrams so I'm able to really precisely control how inebriated my my guests get can I offer you guys some tea yes yes please yeah who wants to get high on the tea and who does it THC mm-hmm yes PG tipps they say five drops or five the grams of THC to a first-timer is enough to get you higher than I'd ever want to go so this is completely virgin how many oh you're putting juniper trees okay solutely thank you more than a cup of tea it's a cannabis cup of tea a Sierra we have your classic cucumber mint and then this is smoked carrot and that is sugar-cured cannabis leaf so this is the normal one is there all I'm going for this one because I don't like number would you care for me to infuse that for you no no I'm fine with that would you would you care for a drop enough see ya also mmm why did you inject in food some people don't enjoy smoking a joint and for smoking and and eating at the same time it's not everyone's cup of tea if you're saying that I'm gonna make that beautiful sandwich taste better uh-huh because off the additional ingredient that's hard to understand for Jeff's point of view because it's not improving the flavor it's improving the state of mind well I've tried it and you put it a drop net and you have it a touch of a bitterness it's like a little bee when you pour like sage or time to me this is different it's exciting is new is modern it's fascist for you I get high on perfection you get high on leaves how many drops money to put in here how many you want two drops yeah can you slow down cuz you're gonna be like a hot air balloon in a minute give this a little taste Holden's next offering is smoked salmon mousse on rye toast delicious all on its own it's lovely music did you want to put one more on I want to see the difference in flavor I mean you're putting juniper trees okay no you're in for a friend for a pounds I'll do this one because I want you to experience yeah you know it's fine so now we can see the effect yes such a slice is in there now is it no there is no there is no rag I'm fine people can get very very high so these honey want which one is we this one has the THC in it it's for friends mmm I really like that one's very home it's good isn't it very distant I told you trust me I'm gonna take your experience only the shadows we can talk to each other laughing like a teenager because just found these balls how much did you take I don't know you don't count the drops I think that is good though the drop painting thank you yeah let's go just steady careful watch the stairs oh I'm fine yeah it's like hey hey yes Ciao Bella let's go I'm with punk rocker Johnny Rotten on this one never

chocolate bars and a happy birthday to me alright bye", "ePPz2hSgyIM": "[Music] hey bakers so tonight i wanted to make something that is super easy it's 10 minutes or less to put together and you don't have to bake it at all but you will still get baked from it if you make it this way so it is called no bake chocolate peanut butter bars and i got off a website called sally's baking addiction and she has got some really great stuff on there and this one has just five ingredients so first thing get yourself an eight by eight baking dish if it's nonstick you don't have to necessarily line it i just lined it across with some parchment paper or you can line it with aluminum foil set that to the side and then in a large mixing bowl you're going to put together first uh half a cup of melted butter and this is a combination of one quarter cup regular butter and one quarter cup can of butter and then to that you want to add one cup of crushed graham cracker crumbs that's about eight to nine graham crackers and two cups of powdered sugar so all that goes in the bowl together mix that up oh wait hold up i know i was forgetting something you also want to put in this cup of peanut butter and that's why i measure all my ingredients out and get them together before i get too high because i have definitely even with this method managed to leave out but you want to get all four of those things mixed in here just stir them up until you get all that powdered sugar to kind of disappear into the peanut gram crackery goodness and of course that nice cannabis butter is in there then right into your pan it should just kind of slide right out there and now we're going to press this in and i found you know the easiest way you can use your hands spatula whatever but um when i cut this parchment for the pan i just tore up another piece here so that once it's mostly flat in here and take this piece of parchment and just help you smooth it out since that's the part that's got the weed in it you do want to be sure that that's pretty even if you got your corners missing you can try to fix that a little bit and then the last step is about a cup of chocolate chips these are semi-sweet i microwaved them for uh about two and a half three minutes on low power just to get them to the point that i could do this nice and melted you can do it on the stovetop too if you want and then add to that about two tablespoons of peanut butter all right and then stir that up nice and good there peanut butter and chocolate and then all you're gonna do is spread that over the top of your peanut butter layer this doesn't have any cannabis in this chocolate layer so not as concerned about getting every bit of it on here but get enough of it out that you can spread it to the edges like so this is so good i can't believe i haven't made this in a while because it's easy and it's delicious so i'm a little high but i'm trying to get this last bit here there you go so you've got the no bake chocolate peanut butter bars from sally's baking addiction and i'll i'll post the link in this youtube video and also online at cookedwithcannabis.com and actually you know what i'll do i'll throw that in the freezer for about 45 minutes to an hour and then take it out and be ready to eat them and then just cut them up and store them in the fridge after that all right thanks for joining and uh we'll bake again soon [Music]", "e6xIaIWI8l8": "it's true buzz TV back with the medical milk-chocolate 120 milligram hybrid bar I'm about to crack into and try for the first time I'll go in for a close-up of the package [Music] [Music] [Music] pretty damn good tasting like keep a bar may have a rival no I just ate one for three just 30 milligrams silly that let's say I come back to you in an hour and a half really message", "x-GPBmmK-UE": "[Music] [Music] you", "tJ02IaNxvG8": "[Music] hey guys Chris here from the YouTube channel Subrosa today we're going to make some mushroom chocolates typically mushroom chocolates are made with philosophy cubensis or other types of psilocybin mushrooms but we could also make mushroom chocolates with medicinal mushrooms so for example I have some lion's mane mushrooms and some reishi mushrooms here I have some more ELLs and you could all you could also mix different make a mix of different mushrooms and put them in your chocolates and typically when people people take medicinal mushrooms and in that capacity they would dry the mushrooms and then use a grinder or a mortar and pestle and they would they would put the powder into some of these gel caps like this so typically typically mushroom chocolates are made by psychedelic mushrooms but they could also be made with medicinal mushrooms so we'll start with our dried mushrooms and we'll either use our mortar and pestle or we use a grinder and we'll turn them into a powder and we'll need a double boiler to melt our chocolate so here we've got two pans one pan that fits inside of the other and we'll put some water in here and that will keep the chocolate from burning and from sticking to the pan at once once the chocolate is melted we'll remove it from the heat and we'll add in our mushroom powder and then we're gonna pour it into this candy mold this is a cool looking candy mold I found on Amazon Prime I think it was maybe $7 so pretty cool mushroom chocolates and a shape of a mushroom and you may wish to wait your mushrooms first for example if you have 15 grams of powder and 20 chokolate that would be about 3/4 gram per chocolate so I like to shoot for it maybe 1 gram or a half a gram per chocolate - just to make dosage a little bit easier you know we've got a couple food safe gloves and since I'll be given some of this away as if somebody make sure that I wear my gloves when I make a move it's a good idea to break your chocolate up into little pieces you could also grade it if you want to but you it's really not necessary [Music] I've got the heat on low and it shouldn't take about a couple of minutes warm enough I plan on using about a bar and a half of this chocolate it's about three and a half ounces so that would be about five ounces like even a white chocolate but a white chocolate will sometimes end up looking a little bit on eater you also want to have a spatula [Music] got our chocolate in our pan it's almost moping don't scale here wait out our mushrooms we have 12 grams so I'm hoping to make I'm hoping to make two sets and each set will be twelve chocolate so shooting for a half a grand per chocolate so we'll see how we did with our measurements on our chocolate so we'll grind up our mushrooms here with the coffee grinder so we've got our mushroom stirred into our chocolate real good and it's kind of pasty so I'm gonna put it back on the heat for just a slight second before we put it into our mold reason that we don't put it on the pan and put it on the heat anymore than we have to is because the heat will do damage to the package of ingredients in the mushroom so you want to stir the mushrooms in well after you've taken the chocolate off the burner there so we're gonna start scooping our chocolate into our mold and see how that goes [Music] so that's a little messy but we've got our chocolate into our mold and and we'll put this in the fridge for just a couple just about maybe a minute minute and a half alright so we've got our chocolate mole was in the fridge for a couple minutes we're gonna pop out our chocolates trim them up a little bit with our razor here and we got a paper towel that we're just gonna put the extra chocolate back on our back so I've got my first had that chocolates trimmed here and I'm just looking what a little bit of chocolate that I cut off back in the pot and we'll do a second round and we'll see how many chocolates we end up with and I'm filling up the last of the second tray right now looks like we're going to have exactly enough just a tiny bit of extra material myself I'll take that little tiny bit of extra material I'll make one bigger chocolate with that we got our second tray filled and we'll go ahead and put this guy in the fridge for a couple of minutes and not too long because if we leave it in there for too long it'll turn white on us it gives the chocolate a kind of unattractive to it so here I've got tray number two and we're gonna pop these guys up I left them in the fridge a couple minutes it seemed to be coming out so when the trick to trimming these is that you want to touch them as little as possible and make sure you wear your gloves and I have even been changing gloves after her a couple chocolates and then getting on a fresh pair of gloves to keep them real nice [Music] [Applause] all right so that worked out perfect we got 20 for mushrooms and we had 12 grams of mushrooms to start with so each each little mushroom would be approximately a half a gram so that turned out really well I think they look pretty a pretty decent little bit ragged but it's a good first start let me know in the comments if you guys have any ideas about how you go about making mushroom chocolates [Music] I'd be great to hear from you guys with your ideas how're you guys doing and thanks again for checking out the video if you want to like share subscribe that'd be great peace profound and lvx [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "lQPp1cWEDA0": "[Music] hi folks welcome to wheats the marijuana edible reviews show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we're looking at a new product that I've never reviewed from bang a company that I love quite a bit normally they I reviewed maybe five of their chocolate bars in the past loved them all they're all great they're all more potent than their milligram it seems to indicate so this instead of being a chocolate bar is a chewy chocolate truffle and instead of being a bar it's just one big what they call the bite so this is bang the bite chewy chocolate truffle on the back we've got our nutrition information all that fun stuff and again it's a hundred and eighty milligrams in this little tiny container and I always like small edibles I'm always a big fan of potent edibles and small little packages so I had to grab this when I was at the dispensary cuz again I'm a fan enough potent small animals so let's open it up and give it a taste here if I can get it open okay similar packaging to all the other bangs you've got this fancy cardboard box and then a little back you seal bag I'm gonna vacuum seal back okay so here it is as it said it's a big chewy chocolate truffle smells like chocolate and a little bit of weed just as you would suspect so I'm gonna plunk this whole thing my mouth I probably won't be able to talk much after that I'm gonna plug this whole thing in my mouth and then I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how this the bite is hitting because that's the most important part of any edible review it's not necessarily how I taste but how it makes you feel so guys I'm going to throw this in a loo-loo our thankful waffle will be it tastes good it tastes good I activate a stewing no weed taste it's good welcome back two weeks it's been two hours since I had the bite the bite 180 milligram an\u00edbal from bang and it is just as good as the other bang products really really happy with it guys bang has another hint on their hands with the bite tastes great but she's like a kind of like a caramel chewy caramel but with a more chocolatey flavor and I'm pretty blitz for a hundred and eighty milligram edible just like their chocolate bars but they seem more potent and they say have nothing but positive things to say about it on the prices I think $14 so about what you'd expect on that range so not too bad on the price range either just wouldn't get me super pleased with the things the bite dispenser near you do not hesitate to go ahead and pick one up that's gonna do it for this review here on weeks guys

dispensary and if you look around here we're currently in Nevada on our way to Idaho to the plane of totality for the Eclipse super excited so I've got this long 16 hour car drive and what's the best way to make a car ride a more palatable that's using animals and we're talking about how these edibles today this is the fourth hobbies I reviewed I believe I've liked them all quite in the past quite a bit in the past that is they cost $12 at my dispensary but you can get them at a discount for about 10 bucks so reasonably far price for a hundred and thirty milligrams and this is their milk chocolate crunch variety which is just like a crunch bar just like a pub price inside of milk chocolate so let's go and open it up and give it a taste and then I will be back to you guys in this same berry car or maybe right outside of this very car in two hours to let you know how we're feeling but for you guys it'll be just a couple of seconds so here we go there's the honey bar broken into these little six pieces like all of them tough price in the back give it a taste let's okay chocolate while he's not incredible and there is a slight cannabis taste to it but it's nothing terrible I mean I've tasted far worse it's just not on the same level eyes like a keep our troops of quality of chocolate but it's not bad so guys this and I will let you know how I'm actually feeling which is the most important part of the head of review in two hours for you just a couple of seconds thanks for watching guys and I'll see you soon peace welcome back to week skies it has been two hours since I had on this beautiful state that I'm not gonna say that I'm in right now well I'm also in a state of Pinus because I just had this how these edibles two hundred and thirty milligrams three doses milk chocolate crunch I see them in solid five right now I I'm a little bit less high than on the other these probably because the fact that I'm travelling just everything is new and beautiful to me out here things and not getting into sort of that the normal service state of affairs so I'm not feeling it as much but I still do recommend them if you see them and if you're looking for something a little bit different I don't think you're as good of a value as a Kanaka or akarova but for chocolate bars something I gotta say you know they're not bad if you Sam and you're looking for something a little bit different you might want to give hubby's hubby's a shine it's not the most ringing of endorsements but it's a it's certainly a and all right guys that's gonna do it thank you so much for

we'll meet my favorite Chocolate Chunk cookies yes I'd like a chocolate chip cookie those little chocolate chips just won't do so I like to make it chunky me today's episode is sponsored by backbone and also the marijuana crime drama a sea of green check it out fully loaded on our YouTube channel you can also get it on DVD shut up and take my money now if you're like me chocolate Aulick I like to use chocolate chucks I like my chocolate today's recipe will be infused with Keith's very commonly on hand for most smokers usually collected at the bottom of your grinder you want to keep it in an airtight container I keep mine in a mason jar and keep it away from the light I like to go to the light no keep is one of the easiest ways to get THC into your edible if you're like me you probably have a lot you want to decarboxylate the Keith I am so confused right now it's just THC a and you need the heat to activate it just like you would when you're rolling your weed in the joint and you light that first hit got a big enough joint there right you need the heat to get high and we want to get high want to pre-heat your oven to 300 degrees so in order to decarboxylate the key you're going to use an oven safe Bowl we're going to use some parchment paper it's contained in the parchment paper which makes it easier and I've already pre-measured my two grams of Keith and I'm just gonna put it right in here with this piece of paper and you want to spread it as evenly as you possibly can to put it in the middle right you want to set the timer for seven minutes you want to allow your Keef to completely cool before adding it to any of your recipes a good rule of thumb is D carb your Keith before gathering your ingredients that way it'll have enough time to cool by the time you need it mmm smells delicious for this recipe we're going to use two cans of Keith two and a quarter cups of all-purpose flour a teaspoon of salt a teaspoon of baking soda three quarter cups of granulated sugar 3/4 cups of PAP dark brown sugar one teaspoon of vanilla extract two sticks of unsalted butter softened and two eight now let's get to baking in order to make the cookies you want to pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees we're gonna add the softened butter the granulated sugar the dark brown sugar and the vanilla extract along with the key in the mixing bowl carbs wise it's gonna set me back don't even give a [ __ ] we're gonna add a teaspoon of kosher salt you spilled the salt and a teaspoon of baking soda and then you just want to gently mix it we're gonna take the butter and put it right in the mixing bowl now we're gonna add 3/4 cup of granulated sugar mm-hmm that must be the sugar oh gold that's gold the dark brown sugar you'll probably need a spatula for this one since it's tightly packed yes and a teaspoon of vanilla extract [Music] hold your parchment paper and add the kief to the mix the great thing about parchment paper is that the kief doesn't stick to it now we're gonna cream the butter the sugar the vanilla extract and the keith's in our stand mixer or you want to touch the mixing bowl to the stand make sure it locks in place and you're gonna use your whisk attachment to make the cookies you want to blend the ingredients well until it forms a nice creamy mixture turn it off halfway and make sure you scrape the sides of the bowl we don't want to lose any of that swipe swipe swipe swipe swipe swish [Music] now we're gonna add the eggs one by one if you recall from the brownie episode we do it one by one in case there was a bad egg then we don't ruin the whole mix she was a bad egg [Music] you also want to make sure you scrape all of this down when you add the eggs to make sure everything gets well combined add the mixture with the flour baking soda and salt after that comes the chocolate chucks hmm you know what I need a little chocolate pick-me-up make sure you lower the bowl when you add the flour you want to start the mixer off slow so that the flour doesn't go flying everywhere [Music] scrape the sides of the bowl so you make sure you get all the flour into the mixture now it's time to add the chocolate chunks [Applause] waiting for cookies now it's time to portion the cookies make sure you clean off the whisk we don't want to lose any of this yummy goodness you can eat that you can use a small scooper or a table spoon whatever you have at home you want to use an ungreased cookie sheet or baking sheet or like I use parchment paper you want to have enough space around the edges for the cookie to spread please I'm gonna need you to spread I'm gonna try to get a good amount of the chocolate chunks along with the cookie mixture that way you ensure that all the cookies have chocolate chunks in them and the last ones aren't just sugar cookies once you've portioned out all your cookies depending on how small or how large you make them you can figure out how much THC is in each serving plugging that back in he takes the derivative and he solves the equation crowd goes wild it's also secondary Tomich THC percentages in your Keef again if you smoke high grade weed your THC should be at higher levels and if you smoke that schwag who does that then you're probably closer to the 20% mark we have a thousand milligrams of THC in this recipe we've made 43 cookies with two grams of keith's giving us a total of 23 milligrams of THC per cookie I have five numbers sitting all around me here we'll put these in that 375 degree oven for nine to eleven minutes until they're golden brown once they're golden brown will allow them to cool for two minutes on the stove and then move them over to a baking cooling rack cookies it's not that sniffing it's not for you let them cool on the stovetop for two minutes and then move them to a wire rack to completely cool now that the cookies have cooled on the stovetop for two minutes we'll move them on the cooling rack for them to completely cool once the cookies have completely cooled you can store them in an airtight container leave them on your countertop or put them in the freezer the last longer thank you for watching episode 3 of new medical

with a hoot and a holler hey we're coming in with something a little different a bit of an educational video if you will now hope you guys enjoyed this one drop a like if you do and without further ado let's dive right into it so first and foremost i want to clarify why this video is being made right i get a lot of people coming into my twitter dms or my instagram dm's and they send me pictures of edibles they get and they're these like nerds robes or these gummies or all of these different things and you know up until recently i didn't have as much knowledge on the topic i guess you could say as i did now right like i never really bothered to actually learn much or educate myself because i kind of stopped buying edibles for a while but as i got back into edibles you know i kind of started learning more about what the current street edibles are like and listen alright ladies and gentlemen there's a trend going on that when i mentioned it on stream the other day the vast majority of people in chat not the vast majority but a fair bit of people were like what are you talking about like oh i didn't know that and today we're going to address that right i'm going to give you guys some tips on how to spot a fake edible what a fake edible even necessarily is but first and foremost right i think it's important to note that there's really only two cases where you should even be buying edibles right a go to a dispensary dispensaries have great edibles that are made in ways that a lot of street edibles just can't be made because it requires equipment that is so expensive no dude in his garage is going to have it 99 of the time right or b buy it off a friend of yours who makes it right if you are buying a street edible and it advertises a milligram amount 99 of the time that is wildly inaccurate nothing close to the real dosage right but we'll get to that part later because the real thing i want to push here is like folks make your own edibles okay before i get dive into how to really spot these edibles it's so simple to literally just get together with your homies smoke some weed and cook edibles it's some of the most fun i've ever had in terms of anything weed related making edibles is a blast dude if you've never done it before it's literally it's so easy dude brownies are the easiest thing to make give it a go okay but now let's get into the the real beef of this video okay so first and foremost there's something i want to highlight right not all edibles are made the same way right there's some edibles that are sold on the street you know specifically if you're buying a pre-packaged edible if you buy nerds ropes i guarantee this is probably what you're getting 99 of the time right i know these are a huge trend right now everyone's eating these [ __ ] nerds ropes dude there's probably a few of you guys smacking that [ __ ] right now while you're watching this video okay listen i'm on to you okay i'm on your ass now all right listen so there's different ways that edibles are made edibles of course can be cooked and that's more common when you've got like a brownie or a cookie you know they take an oil or a can of butter and they actually cook something but there's a new and kind of i wouldn't say new but a what's becoming more common trend which is spraying right and a lot of people when i mentioned this on stream the other day this is the whole reason i'm making this video a lot of people didn't know this exists what people will do is they will take distillate and just spray it on the edibles you take a [ __ ] piece of wax paper and you lay it out on a table right and you take nerds ropes obviously are such an ideal candidate for this because you could just put them so tightly together and just spray them down and waste no distillate right so you take this wax paper and you lay these [ __ ] edibles out you lay some let's say you go buy some candy you know you go buy some cheap wholesale candy you lay it out and you just spray the [ __ ] out of it it's so much quicker than actually cooking and think about it for a minute do you really think your plug knows some guy who is handcrafting some [ __ ] nerds ropes one by one in his garage or has like a nerd's rope machine listen there's machines that do a lot of things but there's no machine making nerds ropes and there's also no guy dumb enough to hand roll a bunch of nerds ropes when he knows he could just buy them and spray them and sell them for a shitload of money right you have to understand that this is a very common trend in the comment section i'm actually going to link an article that talks about this right there's a couple articles i found i'm gonna link you guys can actually read some stuff hey you don't gotta believe me that's fine i'm not always the most trustworthy source hey but these articles are okay these will tell you some facts right but moving on from the whole sprayed part there's a couple prop well not moving on but there's a couple problems with it a you don't know what the [ __ ] the dosage is right you have no idea what these people are putting on you can't dose it they're not actually cooking it the spray is uneven but that's really the least of the concerns of the sprayed edible because you have to look more at the fact of like what are they actually spraying onto this product right when something is cooked like you know let's say let's say someone takes an oil or like a can of butter and they make a brownie or a cookie or something like that with it typically you're you're more going to be questioning the strength of it you're not going to be concerned about a synthetic or something fake in it but when you spray an edible you are opening up the door for synthetics to be sprayed on it and this is becoming a more common thing people don't realize that not all edibles even have thc in them sometimes you can get an edible that is just sprayed with synthetic [ __ ] right k2 for example they spray that right that's not like an actual plant they spray some plant matter and you smoke that [ __ ] right they can do the same thing with edibles if they really [ __ ] want to right they can spray it with some synthetic chemical [ __ ] that you don't know what it does to you you don't know where it's from and there's a million different chemicals that they can choose to spray on these edibles and that's why you have to have due diligence when you're buying and you have to look at what you're purchasing and honestly in my opinion the brownie in a ziploc bag is a hundred times safer than your prepackaged nerds rope or sour patch kid is ever going to be okay because like nobody like sure there might be exceptions i know there's of course gonna be that one guy in the comment section he's like well goblin you know i actually have a sour patch kids nerds rope factory in the shed in my backyard and i have over 15 employees churning out nine different machines of nerd ropes you know what good for you you're the one in a million all right but the rest of the people watching this video they aren't in that scenario they're buying it from some guy who is spraying some hoopla right they're buying it from some guy and they're not buying it directly from that guy either it's passed through a hands on hand so you're getting marked up sprayed [ __ ] you're not you're not even getting a good deal on this you have to realize your plug like if you hit up your plug and you asked to buy like a hundred of these edibles in bulk i guarantee you're gonna get some ridiculous price that makes you realize wait a minute how does that even work and i'll tell you how it's probably sprayed specifically if [ __ ] are selling these little nerds ropes or whatever man are these other candies that are on you know trending nowadays you know you go on tick tock and you see these people claiming they they make these edibles you know oh look at these candies brother just spray that [ __ ] dude 99 of the time they don't actually cook something into it but even when they do cook something into it here's the next concern the next concern is that there's no actual viable way of really testing a street edible right you you can't really know you know nobody's taking dispensary weed where they know the exact percentage and cooking it in edibles they're taking street weed that's never been tested and cooking it into an edible that that that's then also never been tested so they really don't know what the dosage is in these you know they could tell you how much they put into it and you can maybe ballpark it but when you get something that is packaged and your plug says yeah it's exactly this dosage don't believe them right if you've got a plug it just tells you yeah these [ __ ] are strong eat half that's honestly probably more reliable going to be a better product than the guy who's trying to sell you some thc milligram that he doesn't actually know exists right so always should have your due diligence and once again this should just be a an advertisement to cook with your homies dude go make some edibles hey go hop in your group chat right now all you need is literally like like a half ounce an ounce and you can make a small little batch of edibles bro that's all you need you and the homies will have a good [ __ ] time you know what i'm saying listen and you don't even need good kush you can get mids bro you don't even need good [ __ ] but hey that's for another video all right another thing that's very important to talk about specifically i see this on some of these right this is a small little disclaimer that we're going to talk about here is i see some edibles advertise activation time and that then and there should tell you to run if if there's ever a packaging on an edible you purchase that says oh man you'll be stoned in 60 minutes oh dude man activates in 45 minutes dude everyone like it's your digestion dude like everyone digests products differently the only way you could advertise that is if you're spraying it with some boo-boo [ __ ] that does actually activate that quick but if it's actually cooked into the product and you have to digest it right that's a whole different story right that's a whole different story and obviously you can't advertise activation time like that so just what i'm trying to say here in this video guys is is really think before you purchase an edible and it's really sad that the street market has become this way you know when i was young and i first started smoking it was just you'd buy some mids and you buy some mid wax and edibles was something you made with your friends out of one of those two things nobody really sold them unless it was your homie with a tray of brownies who was selling them right pre-packaged edibles were unheard of around me right now that's like the norm everyone's selling this crazy carts [ __ ] fake edible [ __ ] it's crazy man and that's why that's why i make some of these kind of informational videos just spread the word about it dude hey man listen if you're a plug out there selling these shits dude you're guilty okay you should feel terrible about yourself but either way hope you guys enjoyed this video drop a like if you did hope you guys learned something let me know in the comments if you did thank you guys for tuning in i will see you guys

welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are talking about one of my favorite brands again we are talking about punch bar punch bar key lime pie this time I've reviewed I believe three punch bar products in the past I've liked them all they're an impressive little package this cost me $12 the dispensary know we're thinking $12 for something so small but as the name suggests it does hit hard and it tastes pretty good too or the ones I have had in the past have I've not had the key lime pie before but I am looking forward to it and hoping it is just as good as the punch bars we have reviewed here on wheats in the past so we opened up we can see a little chart there telling you different 25 milligram breakdowns but of course we're going to ignore that and eat the whole thing and if you've never tuned in to weights before and you don't know how this works what I'm gonna do is I'm going to open this up eat this bad boy or at least a portion of it here in front of the camera for ya and then I'm gonna come back in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because that's the most important part of any edible review okay so the key lime pie is white chocolate which is not my favorite kind of chocolate but you know could still be good has a slightly donor and a lime motor for short you can smell both weed and lime break it apart there ignore all those 25 milligram little break ups you can see it's fancy little printing there this little fist printed right into the chocolate pretty cool just give it a taste that's interesting um not my favorite thing I've tasted from punch bar but it definitely tastes like white chocolate with a hint of lime in it um it's good nobody like my chocolate I do like one so it's uh it's okay oh and there is I take it back there is some actual like a cookie crunch in there as well for the philip for the crust of the pie it's a little bit but you guys pretty much you're gonna know exactly how this tastes imagine white chocolate with a slight lime taste and a slight cookie crunch and also a slight weed taste that's the fudge bar uh uh just trying it here is not the most important part and the most important part is what happens in two hours from now which is when I'm gonna come back to you guys to let you know how we're feeling and hopefully it'll be just like the other punch bars in the past and it'll hit pretty hard and we'll be singing their praises so guys I will see you in two hours to let you know if this punch bar continues on with the positive legacy thanks for watching well we hit the two-hour mark guys and I am pleased to tell you that the punch bar key lime pie does not disappoint it's just a star strong as its brethren love it love punch bar the only problem is they're a little expensive at my dispensary this warrants 12 bucks which probably is a value for a lot of you but for my dispensary runs a little high but it is uh again such a little a nice package it's so small you know for a small thing you would expect you to have a heavy weed taste there is a weak taste it's not overpowering but it's easy to transport easy to get down and it really does hit hard it does so man this might be the last punch bar I do of the 225 milligram variety they have a whole bunch of flavors I don't think I need to do them all for you guys but I even more happy to have done the ones that I have done so far uh yeah so guys punch bar gets the highest seal of approval from us here at wheats thank you so much for watching and we will check you out on the next review bye hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to

"mAZXWAuWp6E": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys welcome back today I'm gonna be showing you guys how to make nerd ropes here's what you're going to need two boxes of nerds one cup of gummy bears and some tincture the first step is to fold some foil in an accordion shape and spread it along a baking sheet then you can pour your Nerds into each fold of the tin foil make sure you have enough because if you don't the gummy make sure we'll stick to the tin foil and it'll be harder to take them out after then you'll melt you're going bears in the microwave for about 40 seconds and if you like add 1 tablespoon of ginger and stir it in I'm gonna be pouring my gummy mixture into a squeeze bottle so it'll be easier to dispense be careful not to pour too much just like I did on that first one take it slow and just do a thin line now you can top the ropes with some more nerds once they've all been filled squish the tinfoil together to make them into a tighter more compact shape then put them into the fridge or freezer I still had some remaining mixture left and instead of making more ropes I'm just gonna make some little nerd bytes by using a mold that I had on hand I also added some more nerds on top before I put them into the fridge once they've solidified in the fridge or freezer shake off the excess nerds into a bowl and then peel them off the tinfoil now some of mine came off okay but some of them I had a little more difficulty with so I decided to leave them out for about 24 hours outside of the fridge or the freezer so that they could dry out a little bit more which made them a lot easier to peel off the nerd bites in the silicone mold came out really easily after letting them sit in the freezer for about an hour [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you guys they turned out so beautifully it did take an extra day for them to drive because they were sticking to the tinfoil but after I let them dry they turned out absolutely wonderful just make sure you put enough nerds on the bottom part of the tinfoil so that you're not having issues with the going mixture sticking I can't believe how fantastic they all came out I'm so excited and they're so delicious because I have already tried some and the little bites are so few I love them so much I could have made more ropes but I kind of liked having these little ones if you just grab I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you to the person who requested me to make this video because I'm absolutely in love with these and I'll be definitely making them again thank you guys so much for watching I hope you try these out have a wonderful day", "_9GRtUCa_II": "[Music]", "NiaPli8UDB0": "welcome to episode 4 of mmm medical edibles I'm chef Tynan Nicole chef and culinary nutritionist and today we're gonna make flavored candy also known as Jolly Ranchers this episode is sponsored by fat bull and the new ill-mannered film series custom agents check it out on our channel in our playlist section the following are the ingredients you'll need to make the candies okay today's ingredients are sugar light corn syrup flavored oil food coloring water vegetable oil Keith and confectioner sugar for this recipe will be using Keith if you'd like to learn how to deke are pure Keith you can go ahead and watch episode 3 this Keith is from this tangerine dream are you high for today's recipe what you'll need is a candy thermometer a pastry brush and several spatulas I prefer silicon some candy mullets metal measuring spoons and a large saucepan start with your large saucepan our first ingredient is 2 cups of sugar and I like to sift the sugar in case there are any large lumps that's annoying next we'll add 3/4 cups of water which I've already pre-measured here for this next part I recommend you pre grease your container with a little bit of vegetable oil spray that way the corn syrup won't stick to it and you'll get the correct measurement oh yeah got any grease yes I also recommend you do this with your spatula as well and your measuring tool I'm just gonna use this to make sure it's all coated okie dokie for this we're using a 1/3 measuring cup all of the tools have been sprayed with vegetable oil now we're going to measure out the light corn syrup we need 2/3 of a cup so we'll measure 1/3 of a cup twice you can see that the syrup is not sticking normally you have to fight for it to come out we're gonna do this again now that we've measured out our corn syrup we'll just add it to the rest of the ingredients and you can see how easily it comes out of the bowl now we're going to take this over to the stove this next part of the recipe is going to take some time so you want to make sure that you can really pay attention to the saucepan on the stove you want to watch what you're doing make sure you're not on the phone or distracted you don't necessarily have to attend to it in terms of storing or mixing it but you were going to be watching the temperature because we want to make sure that we get the right consistency for our Jolly wrenches it can go from soft candy to hard candy to burn candy the mixture can easily burn and then the taste is going to be really off you'll still be able to eat it but probably will not be enjoyable so make sure you have time to pay attention that way you won't have to start over from scratch and waste your batch you want to turn the stove on to a medium heat you're gonna stir your mixture until the sugar dissolves you can see that it's sticking a little bit so just put some elbow grease in it oh that's greasy that's really [ __ ] I said yeah it's greasy get in the corners because sometimes the sugar tends to clump up together on the bottom and then once you see the sugars pretty much dissolve you can just leave that alone we're gonna use our candy thermometer and you want to make sure that you don't put the bottom of the thermometer to the bottom of the saucepan because then they'll give you an inaccurate reading I put a little bit of water in here what you're gonna do is you're going to take your pastry brush and just dip it a little bit in the water and then I'm gonna wash down the stuck sugar crystals onto the mixture you don't want that to interfere with how the candy comes together you can see that the mixture is coming to a boil and that's perfectly fine we're waiting for it to reach 260 degrees so once the temperature of the candy reaches 260 degrees you're going to add your food coloring okay you can get this at any grocery store and we're actually gonna do the mint green color for the green apple flavor that we're doing today and that's just following the instructions on the box start with nine green drops and 3 yellow drops and then we'll see what that looks like and then adjust the color accordingly if we need you we just need about one or two more degrees some more and then we can add the food coloring one two three nine well once you've added the food coloring you're not going to mix it at all you're going to just let the boiling action mix it itself it looks like it's a nice bright green I added a little bit more yellow because it was just a little bit too much of a grass green than a green apple green I passed on grass all the time the minty green gives more of a green apple tone to it we've pulled the pan off the stove at 300 degrees we're gonna add green apple flavoring to this I'm adding a full tablespoon you want to keep all of the essential oil with in the saucepan and now we're gonna add our Keef as well now remember this has already been decart so we don't have to worry about that and we just need to get it off the paper there we go star very quickly you don't want the essential oils to evaporate completely this may smoke so I have my lid ready and because we're using Keith versus BHO you may not have the same uniformity but this came out really really good all right we're gonna lift the lid on and now you're gonna take your candy moles and spray them with vegetable so the color looks really good I try not to over pour it if you have someone that can help you they can kind of shimmy the candy tray so that all of the portions are pretty equal I've done this several times so I have a pretty good grasp on it the colors of these Jolly Ranchers look really really good they're really bright and green they have a uniform texture to it you can't see the keep at all I can't even see it in these when you pour these you want to have a very steady stream and a steady hand the higher you go the smaller the stream will be but just remember that the candy cools very quickly you just want to make sure that each one has about two-thirds full these green Apple Jolly Ranchers are for Bernadette price we'll be seeing her later in New York what would be filming a video for the new Sean price out and they have compressed show senator so they don't we'll put a link to it in the description I hope you like them you want a lot of these two completely cool for this recipe we made 200 pieces using five grams key so I use all silicone tools because as you can see the candy is all on it all up on it so I usually just run it under hot water along with the saucepan and any other tools and I find that it cleans very easily some of the mixture fell onto this silicone pad that I have here and that's actually completely cooled it cooled we're gonna stack the candy rolled trays just the silicone mat with confectioner sugar and then we can pop them out of the candy molds that will prevent them from sticking to each other I also have a container with the lid that also has confectioner sugar on the inside and then we can store them into the freezer [Music] by spraying the moles with vegetable spray it allows that the candies come out very easily you can see that there are really nice bright green the Keef is evenly distributed throughout the candy you really don't see very many speckles at all if any I like to sprinkle in between now let's go grab a sandwich bag and use it as a glue here we are green Apple Jolly Ranchers if you want to make these sour candies you can just add some citric acid to the bowl and shake it you want to make sure that all the powdered sugar is coated on each and every one of these so what I like to do at the end is put a bunch of powdered sugar on the top put the lid on and just shake it vigorously before I put it in to ensure that they're all individually coated this is episode 4 of mmm medical edibles please subscribe comment and give us a green thumbs up that was awesome [Music]

infused flamin hot cheetos now only RV is going to be absolutely amazing they are also the easiest recipe you're ever going to come across on this channel and it only requires two ingredients what you're gonna need some flaming hot cheetos tincture or infused butter or oil the first step is to spread out the cheetos on a baking tray if you're using tincture like I am you'll pour it into a little spray bottle I like this bottle because it does a really nice fine mist if you're using oil or butter you'll need to make sure it's warm enough to be liquidy and use one of these oil mister bottles like this I'll post a link for each of these items in the description box below now all you have to do is spray your Cheetos with the tincture or the oil if you're using the tincture you can just leave them out to air dry and they should be good after a half an hour to make them even stronger I'm gonna flip them all over and spray them again you can repeat this process and spray them as much as you like to get the desired strength just make sure not to use too much so they don't get too soggy if you're using oil or butter you'll need to put them into the oven for five minutes at 200

wednesday afternoon thanks for tuning in to cannabis legalization news where we explain marijuana laws so you can change them today we're joined by stephanie mcgerno from thc production out in vegas we're going to get into cannabis extracts and infusions but first we do have to cover a little bit of canvas legalization news so tom and miggy what's going on in the news this week busy week busy week i just got an email 20 minutes ago from normal and they say that the house rules committee has advanced the marijuana opportunity and reinvestment and expungement acts h.r 3884 which removes marijuana from the controlled substances act and harmonizes the federal law with the state laws that like illinois or likes washington state yeah but this is just all semantics right because it won't matter until theater of of politics and so it's a committee and so it gets out of one committee now it's got on another committee and then there's going to be a full house floor vote up or down and then if you like that don't forget to hit the likes and subscribes to cannabis legalization news because we'll go live after the vote or during the vote and we'll try to see who we can get on because this is just a link like it see you you watching this right now or are listening listeners our listeners can't participate as easily but the viewers then you know it's just a link that we send out and this provided somebody has the internet they could come on here and we could ask them stuff so we're going to try to reach out to our former guests but man that's awesome it could be it could be like today it could be tomorrow maybe friday and it sounds great but i just like to remind people that keep your eye on georgia man like like if you're in georgia if you know someone in georgia you still have five days to register to vote and if you're 17 by the 5th of january you can still register to vote now yeah and then the other thing about georgia is this could be a lot of mail-in ballots because it's supposed to be in january so kobe should still be out there i hear that's going to be like 20 or 25 million doses of the vaccine in december and then like another 20 or 25 million in january but it's january 5th so if they can vote now i hope they are and then uh what's going to happen in this more act vote because it's symbolic because the senate's not going to vote for it but what if the senate was controlled by democrats oh my god dude that would just be a new america that's what i'm talking about just focusing on georgia point it would there would be so much not going on i mean i mean this will be bs but yeah it would be less you would not be dependent master anymore but it would be very interesting to see that's that's that's all pie in the sky bs let's talk about something that really happened this week the u.n yeah the u.n vote was huge man yeah this one's been waiting for a while too you read a pro who recommendation to rescale cannabis reschedule cannabis in a historic vote now this has to do with the united nations commissions on narcotic drugs and a treaty that goes back to 1961 the single convention on atari narcotic drugs and it was in a schedule four and a schedule four is different than uh how we do it in america with a schedule one schedule four was like the bad one with heroin and whatnot and so they've they voted on removing it from that so that's that's really awesome no i think uh this is gonna be huge nationally right like this is the reason why other countries uh started doing the same thing that we're doing making cannabis illegal in their country now we explored yeah it was it was after world war ii the united states was feeling itself and it's like i'm gonna go ban this marijuana plant everywhere and yeah and if you don't do it you're not gonna get any of our love i mean the money yeah pretty much funny but on top of that you know what other country uh decriminalized it or unscheduled it what's that thailand thailand it's awesome then removes cannabis from narcotics list well i remember when we were talking backstage in the green room uh i used to live in korea for a year you've been to korea it sounds like because of the navy and uh don't you remember hearing those stories that if you really wanted to have some weird crazy fun you'd go down to thailand because they have way more lacks drug laws and so people would go down to thailand and lose their [ __ ] they would do drugs like if you wanted to do drugs like if you is there like a quintessential what'd you do last week drugs that would be your trip to thailand for the most part but you know i've been to thailand and at the time i've been with pattia and the other thing that ireland is known for unfortunately is their sex tourism like some [ __ ] up [ __ ] [ __ ] that we just they were also really lacks on that it was like weird but uh they also have beautiful beaches i i hear i'm not saying anything you know if you if you're into that kind of drugs and and weird sex stuff thailand's there but i hear they have great beaches as well oh no it was gorgeous dude i mean for like 50 bucks we lived like kings a [ __ ] uh jet skiing and and had a little mound of beer cans around us like a castle i mean we're broke sailors living large but uh throw some wheat in that [ __ ] oh my god i want to go to tomorrow oh man uh thailand's also where they have that form of kickboxing which was hilarious because i guess i did that when i was in korea and they would the people that taught it they would usually go down to thailand to practice for so many times during the year and you would see the the fights that they would have and the records for the thai fighters you could always tell because it'd be like 285 and 64. because they like they lived at the gym they they were just so poor that that's that's what they did they got taken in by a kickboxing gym and then they uh helped around the house or helped run the family business but it's also uh technique because when we used to pull into thailand they'd always warn like don't get drunk and step in the ring like because you know the american ego oh i got this four foot [ __ ] no i'm gonna show this little guy who's boss and he will kill you he will kill you it's true yeah i remember like trying to fight this guy he was fast as hell and it's like suddenly his foot would be kicking me and it was like how did it get there so quick boggled the mind uh and then that doesn't have anything to do with cannabis legalization news except it was an anecdote and and thailand has legalized cannabis or taken steps there too uh what else was going on in the in the news this week we talked about uh the un we talked about the more act thailand oh tyson let's figure out the tyson sports yeah speaking of boxing that mike tyson mike tyson fought over the weekend and uh did you see the fight i didn't pay the 50 bucks i know a lot of people did you made a lot of money for charity but oh you were traveling that's right and i i just i wasn't gonna pay 50 bucks to watch boxing uh and so uh i i heard that he looked good and he and it was a draw oh i didn't hear results but i just saw at the end where he's all like of course i smoke that's what i do yeah that's uh i'm glad that we actually got uh meggy to do the impersonation of mike tyson so that he could explain that he'd smoked weed before and then of course after uh he boxed and it appears that it might be a performance enhancing drug if you're in your 50s and trying to have a boxing match but according to the boston herald cbd is not a performance dehancing drug because they said cbd doesn't matter when it comes to driving do we get that one why would you matter when it became the driving i just think if you're more chill yeah less less road rage let's do this right right yeah actually i could see an upside to it you know you're not gonna be freaked out and paranoid you're gonna be like all right well moving on i mean you'll be fine i'd like to add in my personal study i did this past week when taking my board of minnesota that thc doesn't appear as well either this is just a personal uh experience that i'm still studying and i'll work on a doctorate later for everybody to read and improve you have to see if you can confirm your hypothesis that it's okay and so like so far how many of these tests have you performed oh [ __ ] in a 10-year span oh yeah sample size yeah we can get an epistemological or something on this right all right no epidemiological yeah over the 10 years would you say that you've done it a hundred times oh more than that my friend okay so uh uh you're still fine yeah just that just saying uh but these are the fun things we get to do here on cannabis legalization news get a little nerdy about it and uh and then talk about various aspects of the cannabis industry well speaking about nerdy i mean our guess is infusing that that they're getting about foodies it gets birds are infusion yes i mean the the cannabis plant is complex and the technologies they use to do the extraction they aren't all some are some are quite old but then what is quite old decades yeah let's bring stephanie on hey stephanie thank you so much for joining us today thank you for having me it's great to be here can you tell us a little bit about what you're doing at thc production absolutely we're a really unique cannabis extraction company in nevada and what makes us unique is our innovative products there are a lot of companies producing great cannabis extracts in this state but we do things that are catering to different niches that other people ignore or reject so for example we produce some vegan and sugar-free edibles for people with you know dietary restrictions we have a line of we were the first line of ratio tinctures in the states so that would be things like different ratios of cbd and thc each designed to have specific effects as well as the first cbn rich product in the state and a whole line of wellness tinctures that combine the essential oil from cannabis with essential oils from other plants to enhance the effect for things like respiratory function and digestive function we also uh partnered with the oldest and most award-winning craft brewery in the state of nevada great basin brewing company to do the very first line of hops infused vape cartridges in the state so that's just a very brief overview of what makes us a little bit unique now how much science is involved in all that um well there's science in many different levels number one there's the extraction extraction i mean if you go into our our lab uh where we do the extraction our extraction room it looks like a bunch of erector sets i mean there's a co2 extraction a machine there are rotary vein evaporators there are all kinds of crazy distillation uh glass tubes and equipment took together for both distilling terpenes as well as distilling cannabis distillation is uh the most advanced refinement that people do with cannabis so you you pull everything out of the cannabis oil that is not cannabinoids and that is definitely scientific um you know you have to deal with boiling points you have to deal with um the vacuum pressure you have to learn exactly at what points to be uh changing gears and changing glass uh receptacles etc and even the refinement of it uh you know as we've gone we've gotten better and better by trial and learning and applying new methods as well as input from other people so there's a lot of science and then uh it sounded like when you were describing all this science a lot of infrastructure you said like an erector that so your overhead if you would describe your overhead in the terms of expensive to quite affordable would it be expensive um in terms of the startup cost yes there's a high barrier to entry into cannabis it requires a tremendous amount of capital so it's not like oh i'm going to start a consulting business or even i'm going to start a restaurant it's much less expensive to start a restaurant than it is to start a cannabis company and we're a small company even um you know one of our competitors uh they sold their company evergreen organics and they sold it um a few years back and they had close to 14 million dollars in liabilities on their balance sheet because of the cost of starting up and how much it can be we're a smaller company that's not what it took to start ours but it's still uh you know in excess of a million dollars yes and i and i just thank you for you know that and i hope that our our listeners and our viewers because a lot of them want to get into the industry and uh and i'm always like okay let's really talk numbers here because you want to start this where you're going to make these cookies or these types of things that means that you need this type of infusion license or you want to grow and create these extractions and these distillates it's very often its own licensed type but here in illinois it's just kind of smushed in with the growers and so you have to look at the type of operation that they're trying to open up and do it compliantly and then to do it correctly in the right way it's not a cheap endeavor no and then there's 280e which i know you've discussed um so you know it's very very possible in this industry to lose money over the course of a year but have to pay income taxes as though you made money um because you're not allowed to deduct sales expenses so if you pay sales commission to a sales rep for selling your product you're not allowed to deduct the cost of bookkeeping or accounting you're not allowed to deduct office supplies for your operations manager i mean there's so many costs and you you can you can't uh you cannot deduct the cost of delivering the product to your customers or the cost of cash collection we're a largely cash industry and so rather than have our you know 93 pound sales rep go pick up money uh we have an armed guard that goes and collects the cash for us and brings it to us so all of those kinds of expenses you don't get to write them off as expenses you have to pay income tax on those expenses unlike any other business right and i'll see that when we look because uh josh and i are launching a pitch deck thing so like we'll make a pitch deck for a team and we like to break that out be like now guys this is the money that you think you see don't forget to include this and so we'll have opex broken out from cogs and that can really just eat the profits of the dispensary or because yours is science and so because it's a lot of that science you have to make that product so at least a lot of those costs can be recouped so that the growers can very often they have an easier time getting around this but yes what we need in the more act which evidently is coming up i mean let's talk about some uh some help uh why don't doesn't the federal government have to disgorge all this money they've taken over the past few years talk about getting the industry involved then be like hey we paid you now we want it back you know it's going to start reinvesting and and uh and and fixing the war and the harms of the war on drugs this irc 280e to be honest i mean that is a a lead weight around the industry and the only reason it's there is because it is i mean it's but are you talking like reparations though because every time you talk about something like that repayment it's a tax over payment have it declared being a tax overpayment because if you know you're taking the money these states are legalizing it and then uh we're still getting just taxed through the gills because you're not allowed to deduct any of the carry-on expense the advertising the sales commissions all that stuff correct you know when when you think about it the federal government almost has a financial disincentive to get rid of 288 because they're going to make a lot more money continuing the status quo than repealing that honestly but if that's that's what the more act does it it removes it from the csa and so if marijuana is going to be removed from the csa and then there's policies in the moore act that says let's fix the damage that we've done substantively uh over the decades well some of the damage is quite easy to calculate because the irs has the records and it would be very nice if all that money is returned yes why couldn't they put that in legislatively i mean right but i doubt they will what about the money though well it's not going to pass yet you see it's not going to pass yet it's going to pass the congress it's going to hit a brick wall in the senate georgia's super important in january then the industry could be like wait a minute what if we do put that in there okay and then they start paying off their uh their their elected officials well they make paying contributions to their elected officials and then maybe then it would actually pass possibly i mean money talks um the the only way that even uh state legalization measures have gotten through is because of treating it like uh like a business endeavor where there's a lot of money and consultants and all kinds of people who've been brought in to make sure it happens so yes if you put money behind it there is a possibility yeah you know you talked about um social social equity and the injustices and things and it reminds me one of the things that's highly unusual about our company is that we are everyone who works with us is female a person of color or uh somebody who's over 55 and that is extraordinarily unusual in the cannabis extraction uh sphere um we didn't set it up that way it's not that we said oh sorry you're 54 you can't work for us or you know anything like that it just so happened um in fact we have the only head of extraction that is a female in the state of nevada probably one of very few in the country um so that's something that we embrace that you know we don't look at someone and say well oh you're not the typical cannabro so we're not gonna hire you man you know but we we allow chances for all kinds of different people to um be part of this and to contribute it's funny you say uh about the female owned extraction facility uh washington state halo labs has the female only uh it's a female-owned extraction facility and they're great and yeah they're working with i think terpenes and some other cannabis group or whatever but always putting out good information stephanie why extraction why did you choose to go with the extraction field not be a gardener say or whatever else actually it it just was happenstance um the there was a grow in north las vegas that had a an extraction license that they had not built out so they uh somehow got connected with uh the person who is now the managing member of the company his name is rick and they'd gotten connected with him and they said listen we've got this extraction license we're growers we don't know anything about extraction we don't want to invest any more money how about you put up the money and the expertise and you partner with us and build this out and so uh i rick and i were actually partners in a different company different industries in a startup company and i helped him look at the opportunity and helped him start the company i continued you know in my other my other business and then about nine months later he came to me and and asked me to to join the company um so first i did that as the controller part-time and then uh took over the operations so i've been running the company for the last three years and it wasn't something i planned it just kind of happened all of it just kind of happened but i'm so glad it did because it's such a unique industry to be part of um you know when i when i got involved with the company was only medical and frankly i thought medical marijuana that's code for i want to get high which i was totally okay with but um but that being said very quickly when you get into this industry you learn that the medical marijuana is no joke that that there's very real uh benefits for people struggling with all kinds of illnesses so um so definitely something that we're passionate about and that's that's fascinating and this is like a recurrent theme when we have a lot of these conversations well you said yeah it was code for you want to get high and then you actually start learning about the medical aspects of this plant and you find out there's a whole endocannabinoid system and then you should get upset that it's like wait i remember when i was a kid this is your circulatory system that you're nervous nobody ever even mentioned the endocannabinoid system and so if we had that knowledge i think we would have well the laws would not have been what they are but uh we didn't know it until like the early 90s and so it's it's one of those and it's it just it blows a lot of people's minds and i think the people that are growing up now are spoiled you know and there's like oh of course we do that well yeah you're lucky yeah if you look at the the transition of legalization right i mean first aids epidemic and cancer patients were the ones proving that hey this helps us right then uh you know even earlier in my activism online when you and i met tom you know people seem to come to you when you say hey this is you're not a wrong person when you say i've legalized weed now people coming out of the woodworks and they reach out to you say hey me too i had this one gentleman in louisiana uh he was in a wheelchair i think he suffered from ms but he showed me he's like hey man thanks for i appreciate you look this is what it does for me he smoked it he stood up out of the chair and you know for like six months i still was like i don't know i don't know if this is like no [ __ ] medicine because like you said it's that party we're still trying to get through our heads like okay it's feel good it's wellness what's wrong with feeling good and well and it's harassment why are we so in our heads like this can't be medicine this can't be i don't know i don't know but um stephanie how is it being one of the few women representing the industry uh what are some of the things that you think other women that are trying to get in the industry and like you said you just kind of fell into this position of leadership what's some advice you would give to those other female entrepreneurs out there wow that's a great question um really i've been fortunate um in my life that uh you know i grew up in the 80s and even though yeah you know the don't the you know speaking of the propaganda of the 80s and the you know this is your brain on drugs with a cracked egg and you just say no and you know thank you nancy reagan and all that stuff but uh but that being said um you know uh having grown up in that era um and you know having come from a yeah a quote-unquote middle-income you know family i had a lot more opportunities as a female than people who grew up in um either more economically depressed communities or people who grew up in an earlier era so um it's never even occurred to me that being a female would ever be a problem business if that makes any sense so the uh in it and it hasn't been um but really the and this relates to the advice portion you ask what advice i would give is is um is that if you are if you've got a lot to bring to the table then it's not going to matter what you look like it's not going to matter um you know what you your gender is what your age is in this industry particularly that's not true in all industries don't get me wrong um and there's definitely a glass ceiling you can look at who's the ceo of fortune 500 companies etc but in cannabis i find that it is a more diverse and open-minded space in that regard so this is a great industry for women to get into and in advance in um so it's it's really just about being confident in what you can bring to the table and making sure that you put it out there well like we said on the radio show you kind of infused your career right like you took your normal day job and just kind of transitioned it over a little bit and the only thing you're doing now is adding more paperwork to your layers of bs yes um and you know the everyone in our company half of our team doesn't actually use thc um and the other half does we've got a mix of you know old school stoners um you know recovered cancer patients uh people who are a little trepidatious about even drinking alcohol let alone getting high um so like a whole mix but all of us um use cannabinoids in some form or fashion and all of us are very very passionate about what we're doing um and that has led to you know somebody was touring our facility a week or two ago and they said you know most companies ever since recreation went into effect they've just shifted everything to the recreational market and they just ignore the medical market and i appreciate the fact that your company doesn't and what she was speaking to isn't simply that oh yes we have some medical chocolate bars that only people with a medical card can buy but that we're producing they just have a higher degree of uh thc in them that's it oh they could get even higher yeah yes exactly um but she was speaking to our our tincture line um because you know frankly if somebody wants to just have a good time they're probably not going to grab a tincture they're going to grab a joint they're going to dab their you know something more maybe an edible just like have a piece of chocolate um people who are using tinctures they're using it because they have a problem usually and so the fact that we have this whole product line that is a huge portion of our um of our inventory that is really geared towards people that have a an issue that they need to solve and that's important to us and we're going to be continuing to roll out even more um because that is important and then you know starting the radio show just really providing a lot of cannabis education to people so it's really just part of our mission statement almost to you know make products that not only make people feel good um you know on a recreational level but that make people feel good on a health and wellness yeah i level how you mentioned it oh good bro oh no no i was going to ask about market trends we can talk about that after your question well i'll just say i love how she mentioned that in our campaign system right and most of her employees are not say flower smokers or whatever but you learn too you walk in the store and how everybody's smoking weed everybody everybody some people like edibles some people will just put a little bit of concentrate rss or whatever receipt owners say cbd and i like to include i like it's the plant you know and so the when you and i like i was looking at your your website and you have uh ratio tinctures you mentioned that at the top oh the one thing that i really wanted to find out is how do you pronounce picture anyway is it tincture is it tinkature is it uh what's the appropriate pronunciation of this we call it tincture tincture and most people in our state do i don't know maybe in illinois they call it something different it's one of those words you always like i just read before and then suddenly people are saying it and then it's like well what is a tincture i don't know you know you put it on your tongue and it usually is can have cannabis i'm like oh okay interesting but uh i like how you have the whole plant aspect of it so there is a lot of cbd and so cbd's health and wellness and and beneficial applications are just ridiculous and so i just think yeah in the future it's going to be fairly common for everybody to be using some form of cannabis not necessarily for uh inebriation like they would for an alcohol but for some form of like health and wellness and rejuvenation so that's really interesting that you're is that part of your marketing strategy then you know just turning it into trends more uh because you're coming at the plant from a more holistic medicinal side and then from that what are the products that you're seeing for 2021 that you think are going to be uh popular um well there's a difference between market trends and where we're going and why um i mean right now flowers king uh certainly in nevada uh the growers can't they can't grow enough fast enough to meet the market demand flower has just become dominant even normally it's you know 50 of the market in many states it's become much more than that um over the last few months um so that is one market trend um and another market trend in nevada is actually products like tinctures are re reducing market share um but some edibles are gaining market share uh vapes have gone up and down uh you know of course when there is that whole uh lung scare with the uh black market vapes being sold with products that weren't good for you and it was causing people to end up in the hospital so there was a reduction in vape usage for a while and it's recovered somewhat so there's all kinds of different trends going on um but our strategy and you know how it relates to the market trends are all about what's unique and all about uh catering to smaller market segments so we're like a craft brewery in that way you know we're we're not michelob or budweiser um we are like the great basin brewing company as for beer in our state um we're a craft cannabis operation and so um we all the new products that we're releasing um are things that no one else is doing or that they're um we've gotten customer requests for so two things that are coming out right now or that just came out i can't believe no one's done a peanut butter chocolate bar in the state but no one's done a peanut butter milk chocolate bar so we just did it and it's delicious like i just want to eat this all day long it's so good well how dangerous of a proposition is that because i made these cookies over the weekend and i think i nailed it but like you know the goal was to try to make a cookie about 10 milligrams because then you can eat cookies and not like two in deep too quickly so how did you get a chocolate bar well it's 10 milligrams per serving um because that's the you know state regulated limits um but really it's funny because this very thing the fact that it tastes so good you want to eat more inspired us to make single serve little bites we call them that are the size of you know like a ghirardelli chocolate score they're a full treat so you get your 10 milligrams but you get a much bigger amount of chocolate so that you feel satisfied micro dosed five milligram ones because then you could eat another one it's only five milligrams we do have some micro dose products so um our most popular product right now is our chocolate covered almonds we introduced that within the last year and it has just taken off like hot cakes um the chocolate covered almonds we have chocolate covered blueberries chocolate covered uh espresso beans so our espresso beans are five milligrams each so that allows for a micro dose and today our chocolatier because we do have a chocolatier on staff he's making our chocolate covered dried cherries so that's going to be our next new product but you had asked about 2021 and and big new things the biggest thing actually is our soul delicious infused partnership you guys got to audio meet ben the founder of soul delicious and uh he's had a seasoning company for 15 years selling at farmer's markets local grocery stores and he makes his own spice blends so it's not like oh go buy cinnamon or go buy garlic he has a vegetable seasoning a chipotle fire rub a lemon pepper garlic black and rosemary all purpose all these different blends and we're infusing them and they will be hitting store shelves in about two weeks from now and it is the first product of its kind in nevada and everyone we've talked to from people that run cannabis magazines to people that run dispensaries has said this is going to be awesome because you can make anything inedible you can make your steak an edible baked potato but think about it like the prob totally with the baked potato and stuff like that but steak if it's an infusion and the grill is fire grill so it's like a thousand degrees or something right like they might burn off because it's it's a rub so be on that top layer but like you know if you braised it or something so like it didn't it didn't evaporate that smoke point full disclaimer tom's a vegetarian just saying oh whatever i'm still i'm just thinking about it propaganda i'm a vegetarian too so in fact our seasoning blends that we're starting with are not vegetarian um but we have approvals for three more four more blends and one of them is vegetarian because i said nope we've got to have a vegetarian seasoning seasoning blend bin so that'll be the lemon pepper garlic but thank you um you're welcome and you know i've actually what you've just talked about i've asked our chemist to look into um because our head of extraction is the you know master's level chemist she used to teach distillation at unlv not of cannabis obviously um they don't allow that yet but um but yeah so she's a chemist and i said you know look into this because even though he will convert cannabinoids there's also the time factor so if you put something in a 500 degree oven for 10 minutes the amount of loss that you would experience is very minimal for example when you make gummies um gummies usually the the liquid is very hot to get it to melt right and so you're putting it in this in this vat or a pot that's several hundred degrees and you're adding the cannabis to it yet the cannabinoids don't all just disappear so there's a time factor that also is involved so i've asked her to look into um this more so we can give users a guideline for you know don't put this in a very really really hot thing for more than x period of time um so it's not as it's not instant um but that being said you can make you know jicama slices apple slices um you can uh you can add it to your to your baked beans or your burrito you know after it's made if you like um and so this is great because there's no sugar in it most of the edibles are sweet on the market um and then this allows you to have a full-size treat because you can eat the whole burrito you don't have to eat just a tiny piece of the burrito and you could also you could also uh titrate the dose and move more seasoning in put less seasoning in yes because our seasoning is homogeneous um every product in nevada that is an edible has to undergo homogeneity testing um the so for example if you make a chocolate bar they want to make sure that all 10 pieces have the same dose in them um and we have to individually bag every dose of seasoning and put a little thc symbol on it so we can't have just a jar of spices that you pour on um it has to be individually bagged now the regulatory compliance segment of the show awesome thumbs up and subscribes for regulatory compliance but thank you stephanie yes you're bagging the individual seasonings and then what happens you know um so before we bag it the cannabis is already infused in the seasoning so that means that we didn't just add some thc after we bagged it so you have no idea like where it is if you're gonna get it if you only pour half no it's throughout so um so that means that you can use half the package and get five milligrams if you want um so it is really good for micro dosing so the package itself is the serving yes that's pretty dope can you keep talking like the type of extractions that you'd be doing like i have friends that are in history and like they can't get so i keep up i'm an electronics guy everything that has a light and beeps i like but like they get into like and tom does too like biology uh terpenes and then like solventless and solvent like you know i know it's a big deal to have an extraction and be able to dissolve it in water what kind of extraction are you doing so there are four main types of extraction in cannabis one is solventless that is no chemicals then there's carbon dioxide co2 it's 70 percent of the air we breathe um it's also used to extract cannabis uh ethanol alcohol uh so obviously we drink alcohol um but the the alcohol used to extract cannabis is you know 90 to 100 pure then there's hydrocarbons things like butane propane heptane etc uh we actually do three of the four the one we don't do is hydrocarbons and that is uh for two reasons one is that we're on the second floor and any piece of equipment that we put in we have to bring up the stairs we when we did our when we put our our co2 extraction machine in we had to cut a hole in the roof but um yeah so there's some physical limitations and you have to put like a bomb shelter in your lab when you have hydrocarbon they're just the weight limits the size we couldn't do it so um the second reason we don't do hydrocarbons is that we are a little bit concerned about the leftovers um so when you use ethanol or you use hydrocarbons to extract cannabis there's some leftover ethanol or leftover hydrocarbons in the product and you do what's called a purge there's sciencey stuff you do to try to pull that out and to the greatest extent possible and alcohol although probably like not super awesome to be inhaling it at least we drink alcohol you know um no one's drinking lighter fluid or if they are they shouldn't be so um propane hexane yeah all the other type of hydrocarbons that you know they're lighter fluid they're gas you know yeah so you know it's it's really important when you're using those kinds of products um just check the levels of at least in nevada it's all listed on the lab report the levels of residual um chemicals left but um the and people love hydrocarbon extracts because not only is it very cost effective but they love the flavor um so i would never fault somebody for you know doing it as long as they're doing a very good purge on it um so that being said when we started out we were solventless only by necessity um we didn't have a co2 machine yet and uh and so we started out we were the first uh company in the state to do old school hash so temple balls a la frenchy cannoli um um bubble hash rosin that you were doing the solventless extraction so fascinating so you guys were the is there a high-end hash scene in uh nevada um there's starting to be a hash scene in nevada um we were um you know four years ahead of the curve um which you know is why we were pushing to get the solvent extract as well because there wasn't enough market demand and we knew that from the get-go it was brand new so you know you know it's fine to be six months ahead of the curve or a year ahead of the curve but four or five years you can't you know run your business on that so uh so we were uh so we diversified um but the there's there's a growing market for solventless extracts in nevada um it's the thing about solventless extracts is that even though they're amazing they're more expensive because you get a lower yield so if you take a pound of let's just say flour and you put it through a solvent-less extract you might get 10 if you put that pound of flour uh through butane extract you might get 30 yield so um therefore just just that alone gives you an idea that the price per unit is going to be higher for the solvents um that's before the manpower cost isn't solvent list isn't that usually more difficult to make as well yes it is it's more labor-intensive and um because it's it's done by hand even when you use machines there's still a lot of human um labor that has to go into it um so you know there's for example washing machines use a washing machine instead of a bucket and a paddle and you put your cannabis in that washing machine and you run a little spin cycle well then you drain it and it goes into a bucket stack with mesh bags in it you gotta scoop the hash out and if it's not ready you put it back in the machine if it's ready you put it on a tray then you've got to freeze dry it then you've got to um to take it to like a cheese grater once it's dry i mean and then if you're going to service little grams eventually you have to wait in a little ground and then maybe do you put like a little uh a little symbol on it or something to have like a little uh imprint that you could make that has like your logo like oh it's our hash no we don't do that but we do our packaging um our epc we have two in-house brands epc experience free and cannabis and omg thc epc is our solventless brand um and all the packaging is eco-friendly so our hash packaging and our rosin packaging you can actually plant it in the ground and it will grow wild flowers um whereas our tincture packaging is all biodegradable or it won't grow wildflowers but it's even the glue on the labels is biodegradable or recyclable um so that's part of our environmental commitment and so that's how we put our mark on it so your environmental commitment was that a part of like your plan and your application did you have that environmental commitment from day one or how did that arise um no it's not part of our application it was just part of the bent that we those of us had who were starting the company um our original extractors and um our managing member and myself um so we said yeah let's let's do that and um we've continued that and so our epc brand is good for you and good for the planet um that's the that's the the slogan that we have for you right that's nice yeah i like that and then that's the an aspect of the industry that i i see often is this type of beneficial aspects so people are going to buy your brand because it's going to then continue to benefit them even after it's not waste it's what did you say it grows wildflowers yeah yeah you can plant it in your garden so yeah the um and our omg thc brand that's our solvent extract brand so that's where we use our co2 extraction um and we do some bucket tech ethanol extraction um so co2 is very clean but it has the lowest yields so um the extracts tend to be more expensive that's why the industry has gone away from co2 so five ten years ago co2 was the thing um but then you know quickly um ethanol and hydrocarbons overtook it for the cost savings um and the greater yields that are provided um so the co2 like i said it's very clean that's one of its advantages the other advantage is that co2 equipment is excellent for extracting terpenes so you can really preserve those natural flavor compounds that are in the plant and it's not just flavor but as you know that that impacts how the cannabis affects you it's that's really what makes something a sativa or an indica right yes correct we've she's done it we've won everybody she's just exploring the difference between a sativa and indica it really is just the terpene profile and the other the other uh what do they call that things when like the morphology of the plant so like you know sometimes the plant has oh it's short yeah sometimes it's short sometimes it's got the wide leaded uh leaves all those types of things all those genetic diversities that's really the difference between the sativa and the indica it it's still all the same plant it's still all the same thc but some of them like the the indicas they might have more mercy or they might have more uh lianowol which i'm not all that great pronouncing uh and that's really the difference and one of them makes you more upbeat because they're just more invigorating terpenes do you i've heard that like and i've never watched anybody operate uh a carbon dioxide extractor but i've heard they do a certain pass first for the terpenes and then they'll come through and do another pass for the thc or the cannabinoids can you explain that yeah it has to do with different settings so with the co2 machine um there you're dealing with temperature and you're dealing with pressure so the you have to have certain pressure and temperature settings that are optimal for extracting terpenes and then certain pressure and temperature settings that are optimal for extracting cannabinoids so um so that is you know why you can't run them simultaneously they have you know if you do one when you do a terpene extraction you're just not really getting cannabinoids out of the mix and vice versa does that make sense no no absolutely but i just don't understand how they actually do that through the machine i know that they have different vapor points and so like they would get the terpenes out of temperature a and then the cannabinoids come out of temperature b but i've never seen anybody operate one of these machines i mean i can i've operated an ethanol extracture extraction just as like a home you know the magical butter machine device that you can buy it's a very crude one but that's exactly what it is you know you could use an oil do you use any like oils for your extractions or infusions or or no no um so we don't do the can of butters and things like that um uh so omg thc our brand every package on it and it's we have a some some extracts under omg thc but that's where edible line is every package says damn delicious and let's face it if you're using canned butter it's not going to be damn delicious um it's going to taste like weed so um so instead we we take a distillate and infuse it into our our actual product that we're making gummies chocolate etc um but we believe strongly in the power of full spectrum extracts which are different than distillates distillates you've taken everything out of that oil that is not a cannabinoid and pretty much taken everything out of that oil that's not thc but spectrum extracts have all the cannabinoids and the terpenes and the phytocannabinoids and flavonoids found in the original plant you've removed the chlorophyll you've removed the waxes and the fats and so it's a much more holistic uh a much more holistic product the problem with full spectrum extracts is twofold one when there concentrates they're darker and people assume that that means that darker is bad that's like saying oh that whole wheat bread is brown instead of white it's dirty it's not good when in fact the opposite is true and full spectrum extracts are the same way but the market education isn't there yet and not enough people know that just because it's dark doesn't mean it's bad in fact it may mean it's better um so that's one issue um in terms of the concentrates and the other issue is that it's it's not going to taste good so we're actually thinking about doing a third brand you asked for what we're going to do next year and our trends we actually think about making a third brand centered around full spectrum extracts and we might do more of those cannabis infused oils and stuff it's not going to taste as good but the effects are going to be mind-blowing well i mean you could try to see if you're able to do some type of flavor preservation at the terpene specific level but that could be extremely difficult yeah it might be it might be like jumping the shark now you said you do use ethanol extraction though right yeah bucket tech old school you know um the kind of thing you go on future 4 200 and learn to do at home but yeah so we do some it's rudimentary ethanol extraction um not you know mass scale with a hundred thousand hundred fifty thousand dollar ethanol extractor um so but we do use you know uh different temperatures and etcetera in the process um and that we do that's very specifically for one particular product um line which is our afghani hash so we have solventless bubble hash which i described um you know using washing machines to um cleave off the trichome heads of the plant which is where all the little sacks of goodies are that people want their kit um but with with the afghani hash it's uh it's different so in afghanistan one of the ways that they make hash is to take key for sift and then they'll add water or tea and work it to become taffy like almost but if we added water or tea to cannabis it would encourage microbial growth and it would fail lab testing so we don't do that instead we took our own spin we took the keef or the sift and then we made a full spectrum ethanol extract so it's the full spectrum oil and we mixed it with that keef until it had that taffy like consistency so that's our own take our own spin on the afghani hash um and so that's the product line for which we use the ethanol extracts ah man that sounds delicious so if i was in nevada how much would a gram of that that hash cost um it depends on which dispensary you go to um dispensaries have a markup of anywhere from 2.2 to three so what i mean is if they buy something for ten dollars they're gonna sell it for anywhere from twenty two to thirty dollars depends on the dispensary um and then there's the eighteen percent sales tax or recreational tax um so you know you at the places that have some of the lower markups you might be set back forty dollars plus tax um for a half grand okay stephanie thank you so much for joining us today where can we go to find and follow what you guys got going on at thc productions uh you can go to

revealcannabis.com, where I teach you how you can use cannabis to live a healthier, happier life. And today's video is all about how to make cannabis infused beverages. This is really exciting for us Canadians who don't have cannabis infused\nbeverages on the market yet. They will be coming in October of 2019, but for right now, I'm gonna teach you how to make your own. Basically, what I'm\ngonna show you how to do is to make a simple cannabis tincture that you then add to the\nbeverage of your choice. I'm gonna walk you really quick how to make an alcohol tincture because I already have a longer\nmore detailed video on that that I'll link below. And at the end of this video I will provide you with a recipe book that can hopefully stir\nup your creative juices for what you could make with your cannabis infused tinctures. So let's get started. I'm gonna show you what you'll need to make the tincture first. Okay, first thing that you have to do is decarboxylate your cannabis. So, basically this is\nheating your cannabis up so that you are getting THC or CBD instead of what's naturally\nfound in the plant, which is THCA or CBDA. The easy way to do this at home is to put your cannabis into a mason jar and put it into a preheated oven at 240 degrees Fahrenheit for one hour. The reason you put it in the mason jar is it helps to keep down the smell. However, if you have one of\nthese beautiful little machines, you just put your cannabis in and press the button and away you go, when it's done it shows a different color. Again the advantage of this is that you get more of the\nTHC or CBD from the flower. After you're done, you are\ngoing to grind your cannabis just slightly to increase\nthe surface area, you're not trying to turn it into powder. So you just zap it a couple of\ntimes in your coffee grinder. If you don't have a coffee\ngrinder for cannabis, that's okay use scissors or\nyour regular cannabis grinder. So I'll show you that it looks like that, right now the nugs and I'm gonna go zap it off camera so you don't have to listen to it. So, put your ground up\ncannabis into a mason jar, same mason jar you used to decarb it, if you used the oven which is fantastic. I'm all about less dishes. So it looks like that when it\nis just a little bit ground. And then you're gonna\nadd in 1/2 cup of Alcool, or Everclear or whatever you're using. So I'm using seven grams of cannabis and one 1/2 cup of Alcool. You can increase the\npotency of your tincture or decrease it by using\nless flower or more flower, less alcohol or more alcohol. So I'm gonna shake this up, and then all you do is you\nput this into a crock pot that has water that covers\nthe amount of your tincture, and you're gonna put this\nin your crock pot on low for about eight hours\nand then you'll be done. So, thanks to the magic of television. I already have a cannabis\ntincture ready to go. So when you're done, you simply dump it into a\ncheesecloth lined strainer. The other thing I've seen people do is use a reusable nut milk bag, so those are bags that people use to make almond milk or cashew\nmilk and they're reusable. So you put it into your little satchel, your cheesecloth satchel and then actually like get right in there and really squeeze this. You do not wanna lose any of your beautiful\ntincture to the garbage. I know people do lots of stuff with the satchel of cannabis leftover when it's infused into butter or oil. You can make it into high chai or you can just dump that\nright into some baked goods. But when it's done with\nalcohol, it tastes terrible and I haven't seen any\ngood uses for it yet. So if you see a good\nuse for this at the end, please let me know in the comments. Otherwise, just squeeze\nuntil you feel like you've got it all out. You're gonna store this\nbeautiful mixture in one of these to keep it away from the sun, and then I'm gonna show you how to make some infused\nbeverages, let's go. Before we go any further, I wanted to point out three things. First, make sure that\nyou open your mason jar that's sitting in the warm water about every 1/2 hour to an hour while it is infusing in there to let go of some of the pressure, that's called burping your mason jar. Second, if you are trying\nto get a CBD tincture, then just make sure that you\nstart out with cannabis flower that's really high in CBD. This is a great recipe to have on hand because you can really\ncustomize the ingredients and get the exact type of\ntincture that you'd like. In fact, some people even\ninfuse other herbs and flowers into these tinctures. Let's think about some\nof the delicious drinks that you can make now that you know how to make a cannabis tincture. So this is really where your\nimagination gets to run wild. Basically any drink that you drink can now be infused with cannabis. You just take a couple\nof drops of your tincture or a dropper full of your\ntincture, and away you go. So lots of people love to make lemonade or just put some into their coffee or tea. People infuse or have cannabis\ninfused Pop, Coke or Pepsi, whatever it is, you can really\ndo whatever you want with it. The only thing to point out is to avoid mixing cannabis with alcohol. Let's talk about dosing. How do we know how much we're getting in a dropper full of\nthat cannabis tincture? There is a way to get a\nreally good approximation, it's not gonna be totally perfect, but this is a good way to\nget a good approximation. First thing is that you're gonna find out how much THC or CBD is in your flower. If you're buying lab tested cannabis, then you can just look at the label and it will tell you how much\nof those components are in it. If you don't have it with a label, and you do know the strain name, you can head over to\nleafly.com and type it in and they'll give you an approximation of how much you THC it might have in it. And if you don't have any idea what it is then you can take a guesstimate. Average THC concentrations\nright now seem to be around 15 to 20%, so take a guesstimate. And once you know how much\nTHC or CBD is in your flower, then you can go to this\nhandy-dandy dosing calculator. So it's at the wakeandbake.co website which I highly recommend if\nyou haven't checked it out, and all you do is fill out\nthis happy little chart here. So the Tangerine Dream that I infused had 15% THC and 1% CBD, and I use seven grams of it and I infused it into 1/2 cup of alcohol. So I know that in my whole infusion, there's 1,050 milligrams of THC, and in each teaspoon,\nthere's about 43 grams. So let's go back here and\nsee what we can do with that. I just wanna say though, even though you're using\na dosage calculator, that does not absolve you of the responsibility of\nstarting low and going slow because every time you make\na new cannabis infusion, it can be slightly different, so don't depend on the dosage calculator to give you the exact precise dose, make sure that you try it first and see how this particular\nbatch fits with you. So, most recommendations are to start with five milligrams of\nTHC or less per dose. So let's talk about my\ntincture that I just made. We know that it has 43\nmilligrams of THC per teaspoon, and each teaspoon has five milliliters. In tincture bottles, the droppers are standardized to one milliliter. So there's five droppers\nin one teaspoon of THC or in one teaspoon of tincture. So 43 divided by five is about 8.5 milligrams per each dropper. So in my tincture for each dropper fall, it's about 8.5 milligrams of THC. If I was trying to get\na five milligram dose, I would have slightly\nover half of the dropper and that would be my dose. It's really easy to adjust\nthe potency of your tinctures. If you wanted a more potent tincture, you would add more cannabis\nto the same amount of alcohol. So maybe you'd add 14 grams\nof cannabis instead of seven. If you wanted to less potent tincture, you would just add less cannabis to the same amount of\nalcohol and away you go, you can really customize it. I'm gonna give you a recipe for a delicious strawberry-mint spritzer, that you just put a couple of drops of cannabis tincture into\nand then it's infused and you can have a great afternoon. So what you do is you\ntake a cup of strawberries and a 1/2 cup of fresh mint and a couple of tablespoons of sweetener, whatever you're gonna use\nand mix it up in a saucepan so that it really begins to\nbreak down and come together and the mint releases its oil, it's gonna smell super beautiful. So do that, it takes about 10 minutes and then let it cool down and put it into a\nblender or food processor and pulse it until it's smooth. Grab a glass and fill it\nup with some spritzers or soda water and then put\nin a couple of tablespoons of your beautiful\nstrawberry mint concoction that you just made and however much of your\ncannabis tincture that you want and stir it up and you\nhave a beautiful infused, delicious cocktail.

to be showing you guys how to make your own diy infused nerd ropes so if you haven't already follow me on instagram at daverny freeman i will be doing some giveaways so you want to follow me on instagram that's where i announce all of my giveaways and if you want to be a young young young young guy go ahead and hit that subscribe button and the notification bell so let's jump into the video so this is everything you're going to need you're going to need some heavy duty aluminum foil it doesn't really have to be that heavy duty you can go get the 99 cent one whatever fits your grip baby so i'm gonna use some aluminum foil and with my aluminum foil i'm just gonna place them on a flat uh surface and you you will be putting this inside the refrigerator so boom pow now what i'm going to do is i like to create my own little mold i don't know if you guys want to go on amazon to see if they have these molds but i know a lot of people were saying they could not find any nerve rope mold so you really have to do them by hand so this is what i'm doing now i'm just making my own little molds which is just popping the aluminum foil up a little bit so it can have this barrier in between the two i'm doing that on each side so that's what i'll be doing right now [Music] and you guys do want to be careful when you're making your little liners because this is aluminum foil and it's easy to kind of tear through them [Music] so you guys i prefer to reuse these package this the packaging that comes with it so i ain't i'm not gonna buy normal packaging y'all don't play with me we're just gonna reuse these packaging what you do is you take where it's sealed all at either end of the rope and you kind of open it up like you will a bag of chips it's very easy to tear so you do want to take your time to open up the seal and once you open it up there should be a like a little cardboard against against the seal and you put your fingers in between the cardboard and the foil and you gently slide your fingers down in order to tear the packaging apart so that's what i do i do that then i set it aside and i take some nerds now this i do this all the time so i have additional nerve ropes and nerves in there and i like to take the nerves off of the rope which is very easy um so i don't have to buy a thousand boxes of nerve ropes yeah i mean i'm nerves when i could just use this now that you have separated your gummies from the nerves you're going to place them in a heat safe microwave safe bowl and place them in a small one i do recommend doing small batches at a time because if you do so many it's going to be kind of hard to control it so now you want to take your infused coconut oil i like to use liquid coconut oil instead of the coconut oil that goes back to solid and you want to use your tincture i'm using my eva clear tincture that i already infused with your cbd and they're going additional box of nurse just in case i need them but i don't feel like i will it's just whatever floats my boat and you also want to get yourself some type of piping bag or you can get a a condiment um container i think a ziploc bag is cheaper well not really cheaper but it's it works for me and i do reuse these so it's not like i throw them away because i know i hate plastic now i'm taking my coconut oil and i'm just coating this ziploc bag with the coconut oil if you do not want to use your infused coconut oil you can definitely use pam to coat this bat this ziploc bag but i'm saying if you're going to infuse something why not have everything be infused you get what i'm saying you're going to share but yeah so i'm going to do that and i'm also gonna do the same thing to my aluminum layers that i made my little molds because if you do not it will stick i don't care what anyone says in my i've been making these for forever in a day and they will stick if you put them in the freezer you put them in the refrigerator you will have pieces of aluminum stuck to your gummy now you looking at like a food like you're in third grade with goat with with aluminum foil in your mouth like it goes so yeah that's what you want to do just make sure everything is evenly coated then move on to the next step [Music] all right you guys so to my two rope gummies and six additional gummy bears i add half a tablespoon of infused coconut oil just to give you guys some type of starting point but this is definitely a trial and error type of situation so as you guys i have my tincture right here and i'm going to use five milliliters which is a teaspoon of t-shirt and i'm placing it to the side in a condiment disposable condiment container because i wanted to be you know on hand and you guys also saw that i had my liquid lecithin next to me just in case i'm going to need that as well so you want to take your rubber spatula or you can use anything that you're going to throw away i like to use this silicone rubber spatula because i could just wash it off and reuse it now i'm making sure that everything is evenly coated and i'm going to put this in a microwave for 10 seconds and it's going to look like this now i'm just stirring this around to make sure that my oil and gummies are combining together i microwave it again bring it back out stir it around and as you guys can see a little bit you see how they're the gummies in the oil is not coming together so what i'm doing is just trying to stir it a little faster and a little harder just putting a little bit of elbow grease into it to see if it's going to combine together and once it does as much as i would like for it to at this point i'm going to add my tincture to this i only add a half of the teaspoon into this at this time because you can always add more you really can't take it away so that's why it's super important to do this in small batches so you won't gotta worry about anything but as you guys can see the oil really did combine well with this so now i'm going to go ahead and add that t-shirt and do the same steps stir it around kind of be careful because it will splat it out okay y'all see what i'm saying i told y'all it'll splat out and that's nothing but my tincture splatting out honey that's why i'm like uh um let me let me try to put you back on in there girl then i'm stirring it around again just just to make sure that it is fully incorporated because if you do not do this you will have it will be set like oil and vinegar separate yeah this that's exactly what this will be baby your gummies will be to the right and your tincture will be to the left so you want to definitely make sure that it's fully incorporated microwave it again then you're going to place it in your ziploc bag or your piping bag remember this ziploc bag is already all uh down so i'm trying to give you guys a good angle but this is hot girl i'm like oh i'm about to stop the camera this is hot so you want to go ahead and pour that into there i use i try to use my rubber spatula to get the rest of it out but do what you can because it will kind of become you know it'll cool down a little fast so you will be working very quickly boo boo so once you get that together you're going to just whatever side you're going to cut it out you're going to cut it away from your workspace okay i cut it on the ground so you're going to cut it away from your workspace line a little bit of nerves just a little bit unless you want it real thick to the bottom of this pan and we're going to pipe on our gummies [Music] [Music] so you guys i am starting off with a thin layer i like to use at least when it when i like to make beans nerd robes i'm showing you guys how to make one and a half so with the measurements and things that i will put in the description box to my preference it makes one long nerd rope and kind of like um a quarter of one as well so what i'm doing now is i'm just going ahead and piping out my gummies and once i get done piping out the gummies i'm gonna take some additional nerd rope and sprinkle them on top of the gummies so they can have gummies on both sides i um really do this as a preference when it comes to how many nerds i'm actually putting on the rope so like i said this is really trial and error for some people you guys gonna have to figure out what what you like and what works best for you [Music] so all of those nerd roasts that you put on the side or if you're using a new box you're just going to go ahead and sprinkle as many nerves on this as you want to help you out you kind of want to make sure that all of the gummy is covered and go to your next step [Music] so [Music] all right so now you want to just go ahead and put your nerd roads in the refrigerator for several hours and once they harden up you're going to come back to them [Music] all right so now that it's been several hours i'm going to get my packaging my flat irons i don't use them on my head but i should use them for this okay and i get my nerd rose as you guys can see that it was covered up so you don't have to worry about anything getting on them [Music] now this is why it's super important to spray down that aluminum foil you guys see how easy they're coming out of here i'm definitely being gentle because i don't feel like anything cracking breaking or anything like that or in between boo-boos so you see how easy they're coming out but i'm just plopping them out ever so gently and now once i plop them out i'm going to put them on the cardboard that every nerd rope come with and i'm just going to place it on there and we're going to go ahead and package them so that's just what i like to do [Music] so now what we're going to do is i put them on my cardboard liners i'm going to flip them over so that the cardboard is facing up and i'm going to get the two ends of oh sorry you guys then we're going to get the two ends of the aluminum foil kind of put them together where where nestle had the glue already there so i'm just going to line them up as even as i can and we're going to heat seal them with our flat irons with my flat iron they go from like a one to a five and i believe i have them on a a two maybe a three i just want them to get hot enough so when my hand touch it my hand is not burning and i can kind of just like close it all together so heat sealing something together is really really easy you guys and that's just pretty much it you just heat seal them together and you will be all done with your diy infused nerve bros thank you guys so much for watching this video if you guys want to see any other type of infusion definitely put a comment down below and i really do appreciate you for watching this video i it means a so much so here go the little small ones that i did as well now this one i'm going to just do the same thing that i did with the longer one i'm just going to cut the nerd box so it fits this size you know what i'm saying so or you could just put them in your odorless airtight containers but you guys see how i have the little miniature one right there in front and that's pretty much all you do sorry for the noise you guys brandi and devin are outside playing tug of war with a stick yeah yeah yeah talk to you guys on my net video", "T26raig7XUk": "ayoh Florida medical marijuana patients what's happening this is Florida medical marijuana reviews coming at you with a little bit of an edible tutorial video we made our chocolate cream cheese cannabis cake here by taking a cannabis infused butter in mixing it with a little bit of store-bought cake batter / brownie mix and our own cream cheese blend and then melting it all together with our cannabis infused butter this recipe was super delicious and we can go about posting another video or possibly the recipe on our website but to get to the meat of the video here we are trying to tell and people about the misinformation that's out there the one thing that you truly want to do when baking your own edibles is make sure that you never have your temperatures reach above three hundred and forty degrees Fahrenheit and that's not just when you're infusing your cannabis into your product whether it be cannabis infused butter or cannabis infused oils it's also when you're putting the butter or oil into another product when you're baking it into the brownies or a cake or any other type of edible you never want to see those temperatures get higher than 340 it's going to destroy terpene profiles that are infused into your product and it's going to destroy cannabinoids that are going to help you with that entourage effect you don't want that to happen it is the number one thing to avoid thanks for watching Florida medical marijuana reviews", "EkalarGVJHg": "everyone's worried about catching a bowl of these days but my big concern on the recent flight was getting through security with two bars of medical grade cannabis chocolate thankfully I had no problems", "qG-Ac48CyVU": "what's up friends welcome back today i will be showing you how to make infused pixie sticks the powder inside of these can also be used to dip your suckers into to eat by itself and if you add a lot of citric acid you can get it so sour that it's even more sour than warheads which is kind of how i like mine in this video i'm also going to be showing you guys how to infuse the sugar but if you already have infused sugar or don't need to know how to make it you can skip to six minutes in this video to get right to making the pixie sticks [Music] to make the infused sugar you're going to need half a cup of tincture and one and one quarter cup of granulated sugar start by pouring your sugar into a large dish and then pour your tincture on top and stir it all together i felt like mine was too liquidy so i added another quarter cup of sugar and then stirred that some more after i added the sugar the consistency was much better you could definitely still see the grains instead of it being mostly liquid like it was before um if you guys aren't sure about how much sugar to use if you find it's too liquidy just keep adding a few spoonfuls of sugar until you get a consistency closer to something like this then we need to evaporate all the alcohol off of this sugar so we're going to preheat our oven to the lowest temperature that it can go for me that's 170 degrees and we're going to place it into the oven leaving the oven door open and i'm also having a fan just to help with air circulation because you are having alcohol in the oven you have to be very very very careful to make sure to never close the oven door and to always have good airflow then i'm going to set the timer for about 10 minutes and every 10 or 15 minutes i'm going to come back and stir the mixture this is what mine is looking like after the first 10 minutes so i'm just going to stir it and try to kind of scrape down the sides and i'm gonna have to do this quite a few times like i said every 10 to 15 minutes just come and stir it so because i am making pixie sticks um i want to flavor my sugar so i want two different flavors so i'm just going to get another baking dish and pour part of this mixture into it and then i'm going to add a flavoring oil to each dish now we want to do this earlier in the process so we can help with the evaporation of the liquid but it doesn't really matter if you put it in the first 15 minutes the second 15 minutes or anything like that just try and put it while there's still liquid in there so that it can evaporate with the rest of the liquid then we'll just put it right back into the oven for another 10-15 minutes again we're going to have to repeat the process of in the oven for 10-15 minutes take it at a stir put it back in the oven for 10-15 minutes take it out to stir until it has returned to its original grainy sand consistency so at this point the sugar has been in the oven for about 45 minutes i think and is still a little bit too liquidy so again we're going to stir it and then put it back in the oven for a bit and continue to do this until we get a nice consistency so after about an hour and a half it was pretty much all good i did leave it sitting out um for a couple hours just to dry off any extra moisture and then here is what it looked like you can see it definitely made some clumps so we are going to break those up and each of these dishes are different flavors for me but um one is bubble gum and one is watermelon so i don't really mind if i'm using the same utensils because the flavors kind of go together but yeah so i'm just going to scrape all the sugar off the bottom of the dish and then we are going to put it in a blender to um make it nice and refined so i'm just pouring some of this sugar into my blender and we're going to try and grind it down into a finer texture unfortunately i don't know if it's because i put too much sugar that might be the problem um i it wouldn't really grind like the the blender wouldn't really get it to um like mix i don't know it just it wasn't working very well for me so i decided to use a food processor instead but i have a feeling if i did smaller amounts in the blender it probably would have worked a little bit better so using the food presser helped a ton it was coming out very very nicely you can see the texture is beautiful and i just continued to do this for all of my sugar until it was all ground down nicely i do want to mention that humidity plays a very important part in being able to make this sugar properly i luckily have air conditioning in my apartment so i set it really high so we could dry out the space as much as possible if it's too humid your sugar will clump so just try to avoid that if you can otherwise maybe just use extra sugar where i live in canada is not very humid at all so it's not something that i've really had to worry about but for those of you who do maybe you can leave some advice in the comments to help others out as well so at this point the sugar is pretty much done if you're going to use it for other purposes just store it in a airtight container um but for us we're going to be making pixie sticks so let's move on to what we need to make that our first and most important ingredient is the sugar that we just made we're also going to need some icing sugar some citric acid some kool-aid packets or some flavoring oils and some food coloring so this is 24 hours after i made the sugar and even though i did grind it down to a fine texture you can see it clumped up once again probably due to the moisture in the air i'm not sure um so we're just going to reprocess them i separated them into three bowls because i'm gonna do three separate colors and then we're going to start with the first one and place it into a food processor so i'm just pouring it in there and i'm going to grind it down first just to see how it's going to look and then we can add our other ingredients so it looks beautiful you can see it is so fine and not clumpy at all and then we're going to add our citric acid if you want to be sour just start out with um a teaspoon or so and blend it together see how it tastes and then add more as desired you can make it as sour as you like i'm also going to be adding some food coloring to mine i'm adding blue this is gel food coloring and i do have some issues using this as you will see as the video goes on at this point you can also add some kool-aid packages for your flavoring if desired i've already flavored mine with flavoring oils when i made the sugar but kool-aid packages work very well also and they have citric acid in them so if you don't have citric acid at home it'll help to get that sourness so you can see here my food coloring is not mixing at all it's just kind of clumping so i'm not sure why it's happening just yet but i have a suspicion that it's to do with lack of moisture so i'm just going to continue on with how i'd make these regularly and just see if maybe it binds so i'm just adding some icing sugar and this helps with the texture it kind of gives it like that baby bottle pop fine sugary texture that's really nice you don't need to use icing sugar um but it does help with the taste the texture and it also helps for people who live in more humid climates at this point the food coloring has still not properly mixed in so i decided it's due to the lack of moisture so i added my gel food coloring to a couple drops of water to create essentially liquid food coloring just a regular kind of kind you'd buy at a grocery store which i'm assuming most people that's what they would be using anyway so you probably shouldn't have this issue gel food coloring is just what i usually have on hand um but yeah adding a couple drops of water to the gel food coloring definitely really helped because clearly it looks very beautiful um and it mixed very nicely so i'm very happy with that now i'm just scraping the bottom to make sure everything is properly incorporated as well as adding some more citric acid so that it's extra sour and then i'm going to mix it a final time and then once that's done i'm going to pour it back into its bowl and set it aside until we have our other colors now i'm starting on my next one so same process adding the sugar adding some citric acid if you want to add your kool-aid packets you can do so now and then adding the food coloring for myself i am adding some water with my food coloring before i add it so like i said i'd let this sugar sit over 24 hours after i made it before i added um the food coloring and this whole process here today um but after i made my initial batch of sugar i did make some pink and i used my regular gel pink food coloring and i had absolutely no issues getting it to bind which is why i think it was because of the lack of water because the sugar still had a little bit of moisture in it yesterday but 24 hours from then which is now it was dried out more so that little bit of water added with the food coloring helps to restore that moisture now it looks like some of the food coloring got stuck on the bottom with the sugar so i'm just scraping it around to get everything mixed and then adding some powdered sugar the measurement is not really um well i didn't measure it i just kind of put spoonfuls into my taste but if you are looking for a measurement i would say use about half the amount of regular sugar for the powdered sugar so if you used one cup of regular sugar maybe use half a cup or less of powdered sugar but again it can be to taste or you don't even need to use powdered sugar if you don't want to [Music] now i'm just adding in a little bit of yellow food coloring just because i want to be a little bit more neon looking and then mixing it together you can see i have to scrape the bottom a little bit there um but yeah i think that the color turned out a little bit too green i kind of wanted to be more of a lighter green but that's okay anyway it still looks cool i was hoping i'd be able to lighten it by adding in some more sugar to dilute the color but it didn't really help that much and then that's done you can add in more citric acid or more sugar you can just adjust it to according to how you like it so then i'm just pouring that into its bowl and then i also have the blue one that i just made and then a pink one that i made yesterday and now it is time for the fun part which is filling up our pixie stix [Music] now we're going to prepare our pixie stick straws and we're going to seal the bottom of them using this bag sealer thing that i just bought i'm also going to show you guys later how to close them without one of these um i did just get this egg sealer thing but it works really well like look how great that straw looks um i think it was like 10 or 15 on amazon i'll post the link um but i am new to it like i literally just got it so you guys can probably see i will struggle a little bit but after the first few straws i got a hang of it better and then they were very easy to quickly seal now we're going to fill up the straws with their sour sugar powder dust whatever you call it um and i'm using this squeeze bottle to get it in there so i bought a tip that is slightly bigger than the size of my straw and i just put the straw in and hold it inside of that tip and then just shake it up and down and it comes out really nicely um the easiest way to do this would to just be buy bigger straws and then you can just use like a paper funnel to get it into the straw but if you already have these tools at home this works like the best it just it's not really worth it to go and buy it if you can just do bigger straws in a paper funnel then i just filled up all my straws using a variety of colors it was kind of annoying because i had to switch the tip every single time i did it if i want to change colors yeah just fill them up to however you like they can be all one color all different colors um and mine are flavored sour watermelon and bubble gum but they actually taste really good just with the sugar and citric acid like they don't even need flavoring okay now that all of my straws are done i'm just going to take my little sealer and close the tips of all of them now i'm going to show you guys how to seal the straws without a bake sealer so you're going to take an oven mitt or a folded dish cloth and then put a piece of tin foil on it put your hand inside of it sorry i didn't get this in the camera that well um put your hand inside of it and sort of shape it into like a little mitt like that with the dish cloth underneath to protect your hand now you're going to place the straw in your tin foil mitt hand and use a lighter to quickly light the other end then once it's lit you're going to quickly switch it over to the other side and squish it down holding it to seal it and then take it out see that looks pretty good so you definitely don't need to go and buy the sealer for this you could just use a lighter and some tinfoil and it seals very nicely the blue powder reminded me so much of baby bottle pops and it really like had that taste too i don't know i think it just because i used more powdered sugar in that one but i thought it would be really good dipped in or to dip suckers in there so i took these little bags and filled them up with some of each of the powders and then put a sucker in there these are just regular suckers because it's what i had on hand but if you really wanted to up them you could use a infused sucker and you can clearly see i'm thinking very hard about what color would go best i chose the dark one i hope that was the best color combination um i really like the way that the the red contrasts with the pink powder but yeah i think they all look adorable the green one's a little bit too green for me but i also really like all the colors mixed together so i did a mix of all the colors and then i'm just putting them into this little container because you don't need obviously those little bags to enjoy this you could also just put it into whatever you want and dip your sucker in there and i absolutely love how pretty all those colors look together once everything is done try to store it in a dry area so maybe keep them in a sealed bag or container to keep any excess moisture and they should last

I'm just gonna put this out there this week this is pretty cool this is like comes to church with the doses or bubble off so you could do that but here's what I'm doing the review I got they gave them give you the samples it gave me samples through my coop these are freaking delicious if you have the opportunity to try them try them I'm not even kidding and then potency please these it says on the back it says this is intended for strong medicine for people that would have a high tolerance they mean it so for me being somebody the high tolerance pub law I started with one of the section and then another section and I first like finished one whole bar of the vanilla chai cream which was freaking delicious to little tiny bit of cannabis taste but not much this is something that definitely I would highly recommend above the too much so for my two favorite chocolate bars as far proposed seeing taste have been the bang and these guys they have different all different kinds they got a dark tangerine which are stuff is so delicious however their chocolate makers Bravo my friend so if you want to find something that's got a good taste to it not good potency this is definitely a brand to check out so so they're theirs as their website was on the back of them and it is keeper confessions calm anyways thanks for the review walks interview and love peace and shares of Greece", "xyH5X4KElb8": "[Music] well howdy folks both in the weeds the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are going to be taking a look at another product from hi-5 chocalate we've reviewed two of their products in the past and today we are taking a look at their white chocolate 200 milligram bar I picked this up for 15 bucks at my dispensary so about inline with maybe a little even a little bit cheaper than a 200 milligram a chocolate bar chocolate bars are usually a little bit more expensive but I usually find them to be the best my favorite way to get THC and usually the most effective way you know Kiva's bang's default say all those great ones I found HiFi to be not quite as good as those but to be pretty good the other two that I had reviewed this one is white chocolate white chocolate is not my favorite kind of chocolate in the world I'm not a big big fan of white chocolate but you know I thought I'd give it a review anyways I as I said I like the other to review their dark and milk chocolate so I decided to give the white chalk on a chance you know finish this sweet out here and as I said this is 200 milligrams of THC and on the back we've gotten nutrition information which I always love to see it does not look like unfortunately the lab tests anywhere or if they do they don't let us know where the lab test results are which is unfortunate so you know that's a strike against it but let's go ahead and open it up give it a taste give it a smell all that fun stuff and then of course I will be back in two hours to let you guys know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review not so much how it tastes more how it makes you feel okay so uh solvent free distill it distillate distal eight something like that who knows who cares good stuff whoops all right finally got it open here here is our white chocolate with the HiFi logo on it you can see they're divided up into four 50 milligram rectangles let's give let's give it a taste yeah just white chocolate little bit of cannabis taste there at the very end far far from overpowering if you like white chocolate we're gonna like this I think you're like you just fine again an ever so slight cannabis taste to it the chocolate is not as good as kiva or de fauna say but it's it's it's not bad it's not bad white chocolates just not my favorite if you like white chocolate give this a go but guys I'm gonna finish this off eat the last three rectangles here and then I will be back in two hours or for you guys just a couple of seconds to let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching weeds and I will see you in just a bit besa Arnall here and I are back for the dramatic and exciting conclusion to this sweets review it has been two hours and you're all holding your breath wanting to know if I am high or not just for a second longer I can feel you you want to know so badly any interest I'm pretty high I'm pretty high uh you know I'm not outrageously high this is not a Kiva this is not this is this is about a bang this is about a bang level like one of the bang 180 s or so which is not that's not that's not bad maybe it's not quite as good as a bang Nady but it's good it's good the in the chocolate as I said is is fine and it's a fine price mumbly at like 15 bucks or cheaper I've seen it certainly seen it cheaper than that so I I have good things to say about the hi-fi line III like you duh again it's not my favorite chocolate bar out there I don't think they're trying to be the best chocolate bar on the market but you know in a pinch and they will certainly do and I don't think you're gonna hate yourself if you pick up some hi-fi I don't have anything else interesting to say about it it's good you're gonna like it if you like white chocolate get the white chocolate if you like milk chocolate get the milk chocolate if you like dark chocolate get the dark chocolate that's hi-fi in a nutshell and that is gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on a later review peace that's terrible I didn't even it wasn't even close I mean it wasn't even kind of close no what can you do", "6N94uVoIX8s": "all right it's 420 chef here back for more I want to show you how to quickly make some marshmallow Krispies I have extracted THC from marijuana and this is the oil I have a half a cup so what you want to do is you want to pour that into your pot and let it warm up I say to put it on high until it starts getting you know hot and then turn it down low we're gonna leave this whole video on so all right so it's starting to get warmed up here so with a half a cup of the oil I'm gonna take two bags of Marc bubbles all right so now that you've got your two bags in there all the marshmallows pay for them suckers all right so now we're just gonna start staring the heat is melting melting - mm-hmm I'm gonna turn it down see the marshmallows are green now from all the THC the marijuana oil what we're just gonna keep stirring it until it boils down okay meanwhile while that's warming up I'm going to get a pot and for the rice krispies three pebbles win coach that's the place to go so I've got a half a bag here already pouring into a bar all righty so now we got that pocket we're stirring we'll concentrate on this go back every once in a while stir you don't want to stick or burn so you're gonna do a full well so these are some of the things I've made I've made chocolate chip cookies these are potent you can probably eat this like three three times three servings on this cuz I've made banana muffins these were in the freezer always have some ready for me I made gummy bears I can show you all how to do all the stuff later yeah oh I made a cheesecake and as you can see I ate half of it and it's been a week so I need to really work on this wish I had somebody to share it with but all right so now we're stirring again and it's starting to melt and like I said it's a slower process and you can also take these marshmallows and the oil put it in that bowl and put it in the microwave in the microwave does the same thing I like to just do with the slower process up I'd like to be able to watch it you know you got a great amount of money and THC in there you don't want to burn it you want to be careful you're gonna go slow melty area and you know I'm gonna make some super potent so just more than a half a cup so I got about three quarters what's up so that's gonna make it just more more potent and so you eat smaller amounts so tomorrow's Thanksgiving I'm gonna make a pound cake this calls for a half a cup of butter sometimes you can get these boxes in it it'll say half a cup I mean a quarter cup of butter you just replace the butter with the oil instead of using the butter use the oil so if it says a quarter per cup and you want to add a half a cup add an extra egg that'll make your cake stick together better I'm gonna grab a pan think about edibles is you have to realize that it takes about one hour to two hours before they start to take effect mostly one hour but most important thing is to have a little something in your stomach because edibles work that way if your stomach is empty then you won't get that effect so make sure you have something you some guy drink a glass of milk or something before I do it the fat in the milk will bind to your THC and boom all right I want you to see mixture mixture of marshmallows up and mixture our weed oil up and you put it in the jar and preserve it put it in a dark area they'll last up to a year so put it away in a dark area and whenever you're ready to make your rice crust officially move it though all right so next we've got a nice melted consistency here and now it's gonna go right into now the stuff the weed that this stuff is the stuff that this meat is made out of this it's pretty much garbage weeds and it's the dirt weed of the dirt but when you take the dirt weed of the dirt and you break it down and extract the oil you just made yourself some top-shelf oil okay so here we go we mix it up real good make sure THC is all mixed up everything nice it equal that's how you know it's ready and if you see some more drive bits around it just what you have in there just roll it around it and it will collect right into your spoon or read into your your the rest of the gunk that you have looked all right so next you're just gonna start mashing around you can this is a ton of rice krispies treats for a half a cup and this crazy because this will last you for a block well you can have a party in and by some friends over and have a little you know paddle Wow and once they're all right so now I want to just pack it a little bit and it's kind of sticky of course and then 30 minutes later booyah that is so basically if I was going to eat I would like so this piece right here have you in love stoned all right so that's my tutorial to my friends on how to do this I'm gonna do more show you more how to make more how to make gummy bears and so on and so forth just stick with me and hang out and

this video don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music] peace", "NgoDsQqicvk": "[Music] um [Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'll be showing you how to make a delicious infused starbucks starburst drink i use all pink starbursts because those are my favorite and in canada we don't carry the all pink starburst packs you have to buy like the original one and then separate them out but that's okay i made mine pink starburst i think i used some red too and lemonade is such a good combination it's so good there's a whole tablespoon or just a little bit under a tablespoon of coconut oil in here and you can't taste it or feel it i thought it kind of would affect the texture and like the mouth feel and the taste and i can't notice it but it's so delicious i love it so much and if you guys like starburst flavor like how i do you should check out my diy infused starburst video which i'll post a link to in the description box below to make this delicious drink here's what you're going to need some starburst candy flavor of your choice infused coconut oil or tincture a flavor mix i'm doing iced tea and lemonade and then some additional lemon i just want to start off by saying my double boiler is not dirty prior to making this i made some infused starbursts and i'm just using the same double boiler so i don't waste anything at all and i'll post the link of how to make the infused starburst below this recipe is extremely flexible so you can just use whatever you think would be good portions for yourself i'm starting by adding about a third of a mason jar of water to a double boiler and then adding in five starburst candies you could add more you could add less five was good for me um if you added more it would be more flavorful and more sweet so if you don't want to use a drink mix and you want to just use the starburst you'll need probably closer to like 10 or 15. then we'll just leave it on the double boiler stirring occasionally it took about five or ten minutes for these to really start to melt so just keep stirring them until they fully dissolve which again like i said might take some time because they do need to melt and then you can add in your coconut oil i'm adding in about half a tablespoon you can do more or less depending on how strong you want to be surprisingly you couldn't taste the coconut oil i was worried it would be quite strong but the drink mixes and starburst flavor really took over an alcohol or glycerin based tincture would work well for this as well really any extract would work but i wanted to use coconut oil because that's going to be the most difficult to get to emulsify into this drink so you can see i've been stirring and stirring and you can still see those little oil bubbles on the side so we'll need to emulsify that so it has a better consistency so i just took the double boiler off the heat and put my immersion blender in the mixture which was a little bit tricky because um it's pretty shallow so i just added some more water so i could get my immersion blender submerged into the mixture if i was to do this again i would just add more water from the beginning the only difference is that if you have more water you'll need to put it in the fridge to get cold whereas if you use less water you could just pour it directly over ice and drink it right away now you can add your flavoring of choice for me for this one i'm using some lemon and i really love this powdered lemon because it tastes like real lemon and it's easy to always have on hand and then i'm also going to be adding um some crystal light lemonade and just mixing that in now everything's pretty much done i've tasted it and added some more lemon to my liking and then i'm just going to put it in a mason jar and put it in the fridge and as i put it into a mason jar i realized this would probably be the better way to emulsify it because the immersion blender really gets in there so just a little tip don't be silly like i was and try to use your immersion blender in a shallow dish when you could just do it in a large mason jar now i'm just going to throw it in the fridge to get it nice and chilly now that it's nice and cold from being in the fridge i'm going to shake it up and pour it over some ice the sweetness of the starburst mixed with the tanginess of the lemon and the lemonade is such a good combination and i really love it and the iced tea was good too but there was just something about that pink starburst lemonade that was just to die for too simple too delicious don't get any better i'm eating a starburst while drinking it that that actually does make a little better [Music] so good i feel like there's so many different combinations you can make with different flavors of starburst hope you guys try this out please let me know if you do if you like this video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thank you guys so much for watching [Music] you", "-fWfip8_nkA": "hi and welcome to Kara basics today we learn five easy ways to use cannabis vegetable glycerin tincture marijuana vegetable glycerin or VG tincture is a thick sweet and usually golden to dark brown color tincture which has the amazing capability to allow THC to mix easily into water-based liquids there are several ways of making vegetable glycerin tinctures some involving the cannabis and VG sitting for months on end others use heat to speed the extraction and sometimes alcohol is used to extract the THC which is then combined into the vegetable glycerin we'll put links to some of these methods at the end of the video and in the description but no matter how you make or acquire your tincture here are five easy ways to put it to good use one of the easiest ways to use your vegetable glycerin tincture is to make jello with it you can use it one small package of jell-o and make it just for the directions and once you pour your jello into your boiling water you want to mix that make sure it's thoroughly mixed and then go ahead and add in your vegetable glycerin tincture for one small package of jell-o depending on the potency of your tincture one tablespoon is probably enough next step is to go ahead and make sure that you've fully incorporated and by that I mean really really mixed the hell out of it and makes your VG in there and then now you're going to go ahead and get a cup of cold water ready I like to do that by pouring a water over ice and then using the ice to water and then combine the one cup of cold water with the one cup of hot water and again mix it very thoroughly and making sure that we get that tincture mixed all the way through as much as possible and then as per the directions of the jello put that in the refrigerator for about three or four hours and you're gonna have a nice marijuana infused dessert treat that you can hardly at all even taste the cannabis in this if you use that ratio it's very transparent a nice way to get a small dose of the vegetable glycerin tincture and it really helps if you have a sore throat of anything and that jello next up we have fruit juice because the vegetable glycerin tincture allows the cannabis to become soluble in water you don't really even need heat or anything like that to be able to mix it into a water-based drink such as this is a watermelon drink here but you could use pretty much any kind of drink that you want or a smoothie and just simply take the cap off depending on how much you're gonna put in you might need to take one drink out to make a little room but I've only put about a teaspoon in this and I didn't need to take any room out but just make sure you shake it thoroughly and again now you just want to make sure you incorporate it good so you don't get all of your tincture in one drink so you don't want to shake it a minute or so and then if you let it sit for very long between drinks you'll want to shake it up between each each sort of session okay and conversely as well as you could add it to cold drinks you can also add it to hot drinks so the third method we're showing here is to add it to a cup of tea but of course you could also use coffee and you could also even use a cup of hot cocoa but especially if you're using tea what you want to do is you want to make sure that you go ahead and let your tea steep fully and then go ahead add in your any other flavorings such as honey or lemon or whatever you're adding in and then add the tincture and last and you certainly don't want to add your tincture in first because it's gonna absorb into your tea bag so make sure that you've taken your tea bag out squeezed it out added anything else and then add your tincture and last again mix it thoroughly I like to use the dipping spoon to mix it when it's hot it'll melt all the takes you right off there you've got a nice marijuana infused cup of tea or coffee or cocoa [Music] okay and the next method is to make silly syrup and what silly syrup is is basically taking any kind of syrup or honey I would recommend real maple syrup but I'm just using kind of just cheap breakfast syrup here which has a very similar consistency to the vegetable glycerin tincture and not adding in a ratio I would say at least two to one but you probably want to go maybe even four to one for parts syrup to one part of the vegetable glycerin texture then once you have it combined mix it well again and you can store it just like it is for on the counter for as long as you could store the syrup usually but the one thing is you wouldn't want to make sure that you thoroughly shake or mix it each time before you use it but once it's made you could use it just like you would any other kind of syrup I'm putting it over some waffles here with some melting butter and it's delicious again the artificial maple flavoring and this syrup totally disguised that a pretty large amount of cannabis tincture that was in there you didn't even notice that at all and it's a really effective way to to get your medicine into you on a daily basis without smoking or causing any further harm to you and it's a nice subtle way to do it the only thing about this especially in the syrups or anything like that you want to make sure you label it and keep it out of reach of children if you make any of these kinds of recipes that would sit around and then she could use on in and then our fifth and final method here is to use it as an e-cig juice a lot of people don't know that this vegetable glycerin tincture will just vape perfectly right inside of your ecigs cigarette device and you just however you fill your device normally you just put in the tincture I use a little syringe with the the big needles which is used for that and it's perfect and it vapes good it tastes good you could add in some flavorings some lemon or some pine or whatever flavor you might want to flavor up your tincture but it's great just as it is this episode of cata basics

"H5f073sUB6k": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to week two the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on this review we are talking my favorite company on the planet we're talking canna Co another one of their 100 milligram erse one that I've never reviewed any of their this this one on any level before but I'm excited to do it because I love these kind of things and that's Kanako's 100 milligram lemon bar that's right 100 milligram lemon bar from canna Co super super excited I've loved every single can of coke product I've reviewed I've loved every milligram egde I've reviewed from them 100 250 and 500 although the 500s are definitely too strong for me to do in one go but I've done it before watch the video yeah so I'm super excited about this as I said I love love lemon bars too so I'm really looking forward to this one let's a look at the back of the box here I've already opened it up just a little bit to make this a little bit easier on me as we've got our back of the package here 440 calories for the whole thing the pure experience and lemon bar says on the front here delicious sugar cookie crust layered with lemon filling topped with vanilla icing and finished with refreshing lemon zest sounds awesome let's go ahead and get right into it here just a second and here we go here is the lemon bar a handsome product if I've ever seen one there's the sugar cookie crust the lemon filling and that baller-ass looking vanilla icing it's big it's very big much bigger than I thought it was going to be it weighs quite a bit it feels quite heavy let's go ahead and give it a bite there's a quality lemon bar mmm good crust get billing good icing no real cannabis taste what to me to speak up at all almost completely devoid of cannabis taste just a good lemon bar um all right guys well I'm gonna enjoy polishing this off and I will see you in two hours or actually I'll see you guys in just a couple of seconds but I'll be back in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching Wheaton I'll see you in just a bit peace hi guys it's been Oh actually a little bit longer than two hours I must confess I accidentally took a nap in between this review which might have tested the power of the product of the Kanak Oh a lemon bar 100 milligram that I felt it necessary to take a nap in between the the review there I enjoyed the product quite a bit I loved how it tasted absolutely left how it tasted and it got me up to like a solid six half maybe from a hundred milligram at a bull which is just I mean it's just ridiculous it's incredible as all kind of coat products seem to be I love them all this is definitely no exception for me I love love love the lemon bar 100 milligrams even at 100 milligrams it got me really really high so I'm completely pleased with it oh I believe it cost me ten bucks at my dispensary so an utterly affordable edible as well if you see one at a dispensary and you like the lemon bars do not hesitate to grab one you will certainly be happy you did that is again the Kanak Oh lemon bar 100 milligrams thank you so much for watching wheats guys and we will check you out on the next review peace I'm not gonna throw that at this camera", "puo5p23ySaU": "hey guys so I'm doing a quick little review for you guys today I'm gonna beat around the bush or anything I'm just gonna get straight into it and say that the most potent edibles I found by far are these kauravas I've had a lot of these Korova to 50 they're super super potent my favorite was the mint dip it was awesome hit the weed flavor pretty good really recommend kirova they're always on point there's like no other company they said it was like 250 milligrams crazy potent the only thing that can come close to it were these moon cakes like these moon bars a lot of them are like bars these ones are like very blasters that little chocolate balls in them this was also super potent but I would still have to give it up to kuba I would say that they were a little bit more potent now my favorite edible are these OG edibles they were only 5 bucks their potency was right up there like bang for the buck wise with kirova you know three of these there are like five bucks each pretty potent and we knew one place that was selling them they kind of stopped selling those started selling those good times ones these are okay they are not as potent as the OG edibles I don't really like the bodies anymore they are a little tastier sometimes these can be a little stale but they definitely got you high over five books you couldn't beat him yeah these are right there about on point with these TKO edibles they say a 160 milligrams I would say that's about right these guys are you know that it's pretty accurate they're kind of average same with Wally drops I think they advertise pretty accurately even milligrams of THC yeah Eddie Pierre pretty much the same thing nothing to write home about they're not that great but they're not screwing you over either pretty good these none of pots and helisas I'm not sure if they're the same company or not but they have like really gourmets this is what I would recommend to get someone as a gift who has like a lower tolerance not really a smoker that much really good candy in here a little little high not very much definitely less than 150 so you know be aware that but the candy makes it for it they're not that expensive the good guys this was actually a really potent lollipop it's at 50 I think it's actually more than that big piece it's kind of the same thing it says ten milligrams if you're smoker that's not gonna get you high more of a gift you know for a friend there's early smoke that much I'd be nice I had these micro dough strips they're pretty cool it's like the little mint things you put it on your tongue he's just like man there's 50 milligrams it on the back it says it's 40 I would say that's about accurate I felt about 40 sativa these were actually pretty cool I would like to get more you know just stick them under your tongue do whatever you have to do for the day it's pretty cool so and there is one more that that I don't have here and that's because I just threw away the packaging is also pissed it was lol edibles they were the worst so they get my award for worst edible they are not that great about the same quality stuff you find maybe at like Circle K but stale and their THC milligram claims are outrageous and there's nothing there it's totally a lie I hate that company they're pretty shitty but anyway to recap most potent Korova my favorite OG edibles best for a gift he's not a Potts T Elise's and stay away from lol edibles all the rests are pretty much about the same nothing too awesome nothing like super shitty these are really potent so go ahead and try those other than that yeah that's about it so that was my quick edible review so subscribe for more and I'll keep testing them out

clarifying it and i really kind of don't care to clarify it but that's just my business if you guys want to know how to make and fuse butter definitely comment down below and i'll get up on that thing girl so now i have melted down my infused butter i put it in the microwave for like 30 30 seconds and just stir it around and it should admit that melt down very easily so i'm just going to go ahead and use my rubber spatula and stir this around and i'm going to portion out my chips so there really isn't a cut dry type of cookie cutter when it comes to dosage it really just depends on you and how much you would like in your bags of chips i'm using five milliliters um that's my little dropper that i'm using right there to determine what my dosage will be per bag um this bag i made i believe i made like two to three ziploc bags of this and i was able to determine that each bag had about 23 me um milligrams of stuff inside of it and to me the average milligrams are five so i think that's kind of pretty good so whatever you use your cbd for you don't want to overdo it but you can definitely kind of calculate that if you guys really want a detailed video on how you can calculate this then we can go from there but you just want to make sure that all of your chips are nice and covered not soaking wet but covered enough so everything can infuse well then you want to lay them out very like in a single layer i really take my time to lay them out in a single layer because if they're on top of each other you're going to kind of like if that defeats the purpose basically so look you want to put a nice even roll do not overcrowd your pan like we never do easy bakers then you're going to move on to the next step now that i have them in a single layer i'm just going to add a little bit more butter on top of them because i'm a little extra and i like for all my foods to be a little extra when you think you got enough i'd like powder you don't so i'm going to put this in a 350 degree oven for three minute intervals taking them out after the three minutes just to really check on them to make sure that they're not burning because maybe they will burn when i tell you they will burn grow they will burn burn so i'm taking that same rubber spatula that i use to mix up that butter and just kind of mixing them around again just to make sure that everything is evenly coated and nothing is sticking down to burn then i'm going to go ahead and place them back on in that oven for another three minutes until they get to the smell in the infusion that i like [Music] and what you guys are seeing here i'm just trying to make sure that they're not on top of each other so much just trying to make sure they get that even layer as much as i can and i end up placing them in the oven about three to four different times for those three minute intervals [Music] just between you and us girlfriends good judy's honey if you guys get this video up to 4 000 views i can definitely show you how to make cbd infused butter tinkeridge as well as all so let's just get these views up and you guys will know how to make all of these good stuff [Music] so now i'm just going to let them dry for about 10 minutes but now that i'm done with that i can pick it up and you guys still see there is a crunch still to them it is not soggy like some other people they're very crunchy they're very nice and just to add up that flavor i'm just taking a little bit of chips putting that in my food processor grinding them up until kind of like powder because i want that heat just to be like packed out um the people that i invite to my parties and different things like that they like as spicy they like it crunchy hey so that's what i'm doing right now just giving it just a little razzie dazzy and i'm putting this over on top of it so when it dries it all just dries together now this is definitely an optional step but that's just something that i personally like to do and i also just put a little bit of tinkering on it too just to make my people really feel the effects of that cbd so that's just my preference with what i like to do but you are going to just let these come just dry a little then place them in your bags [Music] [Music] [Music] so you guys this was only about two bags i just did two bags and i thought it had 23 but with two bags it was at least 45 milligrams inside of both of those bags hannah so girl we were we had fun period [Music] and i'll also show you guys how i heat seal my bags too i just take my flat iron since i do not use them for my head and i just put it on the bags just like that i do this when i use my nerd ropes and heat seal my nerd robes in my cheetos in the smaller bags i just didn't have any smaller bags so i used ziploc bags this time but as you guys can see it is sealed you don't have to worry about anything becoming stale and that's what i love about these cbd chips and cheetos i can just heat seal them in and i can just get them at any time they last for as long as chips last on the chef baby when i tell you girl thank you for watching the video and i will definitely talk to you on my next one", "vLm9VAXFl6I": "and so I'd still take my life in it a fruit roll-up what's up guys welcome back today I have yet another gummy video for you guys and I'm very excited about this one because I think it's going to make a lot of people's lives a lot easier and it is going to be delicious today we're going to be doing a little experiment making gummies out of two ingredients store-bought gummy bears tincture or coconut oil so I just bought some gummies from bulk barn any gummies are fine and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to melt these down and I'm gonna add to some of them tincture and to some of them coconut oil and we're gonna see how they're going to turn out I think the ones with tincture will turn out amazing the coconut oil ones I'm not so sure about so let's try it out and see how it goes PS these are like the best gummies ever they're the Albanese brand you can buy them at a lot of places and they're so good they have like the best flavors the green ones and the white ones are my favorite so I'm actually not going to use them for this recipe so I'm probably gonna eat them while I'm melting them first step is to sort your gummies you don't have to smoke them if you don't want to but I want all my colors to be separate all right let's do this so I separated my gummies into yellow and orange purple and then my favorite ones just to eat while I'm doing this and we're gonna melt them and then add in our ginger and coconut oil and see how it goes I have no idea how long it's going to take us to microwave them so I'm going to start with like 15 second intervals and just check on them and then we'll find out how long it takes to melt them without over putting them I don't know so start with these great ones here there's a total of 13 gummy bears in here and they're just regular sized right there I mean they're a little bit bigger than like kuriboh gummy bears um but they're pretty standard so I was going bears and you guys can even see that okay so I'm gonna check on them in about 15 seconds and see how warmed up and melted they are so that's 20 seconds and they're starting to melt but they still need a little bit more so I put it in there for another 10 seconds okay so this is a total of 30 seconds pretty much melted and good to go I'm gonna add my tincture into here for this amount of gummies I'm going to do 1/2 a teaspoon of tincture so it's just room temperature you don't want to have it like really cold or frozen because it will affect the heat from the gummy so we'll just put that half a teaspoon in so there it is and let's see how well this stirrer is in if it doesn't stir it hopefully you guys can see that can you oh you guys can't even see that there we go so hopefully that stirs in well and if it doesn't we are going to add some lesson and lecithin into this to help combine it but I think that there's enough things and the gummy bears to start with that we shouldn't have any issues getting this to emulsify or combine or whatever you want to call it so that looks pretty good and then we're just gonna put these into a mold the same way you would with homemade gummies and let them sit and we will move on to our next batch so this is quite a bit thicker then they're coming mixtures so it seems like it's kind of hard for the little syringe to pull it up so that's one a little bit of an issue here so let's see yeah see we can't really soak it up so our options would be to microwave it more so it gets more liquidy or to add more liquid but I do not want to add more liquid so I am going to put it in the microwave for another 10 seconds okay so that was another ten seconds for a total of 30 are sorry a total of 40 seconds and I think they should be good enough to be able to put into our molds so I have about half in the mold then it's being a little bit trickier to put in that I thought it was going to be I'm having some trouble like getting the the dropper to like suction it up and that's because it is really thick so again I'm going to put it into the microwave for another 10 seconds and warm it up some more now if you had a lot more going there zero melting I'm like I did it this won't be as much of an issue because the heat will contain itself because there's a larger amount because there's such a small amount that's getting cooled off quicker and thickening faster and also like my dropper is like has a limited stuff to suck up so that won't be if you're doing a larger amount but it's not hurting anything by putting it in the microwave for just like 10-15 second intervals you just have to make sure you work kind of fast so let's throw that back in okay so looks a little different now I guess it just melted a lot more it's a lot more liquidy and put these interim moles okay so I put the purple ones into a molds now let's try some more but with the coconut oil let's do the yellow ones one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen so we'll do thirteen of them just like we did last time and then we're gonna microwave this I'm going to start it with 40 seconds okay here's our 40 seconds melted they're nice and liquidy still might be a bit of an issue with the syringe dropper thing but if you have like one of those bottles you can dispense them with that'll be like way easier but let's add in the coconut oil so I hope you know what nut oil is what I expect to be the most difficult but I think that there's already less lecithin in the gummy bears so the oil should be able to emulsify pretty good but we'll find out so let's have it half a teaspoon of coconut oil okay we got our half teaspoon let's mix that in so so far it's actually mixing in really well that's all something I do for gummy bears with tincture instead of coconut oil because they I think they taste better but I know that most people you should just have coconut oil on hand the texture is a little bit different with the coconut oil I'm going to put that back in the microwave for another like 15 seconds alright so I did another 10 seconds I thought 15 might be too much all right now let's put these in their molds it looks like it's a lot harder using these so I'm gonna use one of my squeeze bottles which will be a lot you hear well I guess I should say hopefully it will be a lot easier you can see that like the coconut oil's making it like that doesn't like stick to the sides of the bottle that much I'm actually very surprised how well the cup oil mixed in oh my god that's so hot oh god it burns okay so don't touch hot melted candy because it is really hot and it hurts okay and this is cooled off a bit now that I've changed the bottle so hopefully it comes out okay if not I'll put it until I got a hot bowl of water or something look at all that gelatin or gummies sitting on the top there and I gotta get him down I'm just gonna leave this to sit upwards to get this to come down guys it's just it's it's too sticky this didn't really work that well either I'm gonna take the metal cap off and I'm gonna put it in the microwave just like this hopefully that works okay I did it ten seconds in the microwave it still doesn't look like it's gonna come out like this No okay this is not working either see another way that we can get this into the mold I mean like it's still gonna taste delicious I'm probably gonna have to eat a lot of this like just peel out of the bowl and stuff okay my plan was to cut a hole and squish this through but I don't think that's gonna happen well let's let's try see oh it's working okay I mean it's a little hardened now Oh No okay this is not working very well okay so the melting of the gummy bears and adding coconut oil didn't work very well I don't know why it seems like it almost got like harder like I now I'm just wondering if I like I microwaved it too many times like I don't know it just it won't come out really it's too thick to come out of anything so I'm gonna make another batch with the tincture just to test that out um again and see it's like it's definitely going to work or if it's user error and I mean it still I'd still take my get it a fruit roll-up it still tastes good if you wanted to you just melt them and then I mean this is really good little easy to get through oh look but you could just melt it and put it onto like parchment paper or silicone and peel it off after and just cut it into strips it's like the same thing it just won't be in the molds the actual gummy product mixed really well - coconut oil it tastes amazing of course you just they just happen to make sure it's pretty making the mold so still work very good I'll be snacking on this later okay let's do some more with the orange gummies and let's put some more tincture and then this time 1112 where do we do 13 or 12 I remember 30 I think and you don't have to do 13 so it's just the number I'm doing I don't know just - just what it is I'm doing and yeah you can just use whatever amount you want obviously you're really good okay let's microwave this you've got 30 seconds we're gonna do double the tincture so one teaspoon instead of half a teaspoon see this looks like it might have been too much tincture too much liquid and they might not set but you could always add more gelatin but I have a feeling these will set they'll just be a lot softer but if you want them to be able to firmer you could just add a sprinkle of gelatin a little more liquidy consistency as will definitely be easier to put into our moulds hopefully this one works a bit better I think it will we just got to act fast I mean using a dropper I probably would've been fine I don't know why decided to use this because it's such a small amount coming out already there we go oh yeah that's perfect oh and also just FYI if you buy these bottles which are really great for gummy making when you're making larger amounts not like this much died by making the tape it comes with like this I don't know if you can see that it's really really small and the gummy mixture is usually too thick to come out so I just put a different tip that's a little bit wider on there to make sure it can get through this was really difficult to use with such a small amount that I had so use a dropper if you have one this is usually my go-to option to squeeze things into molds but because there is such little amount when I squeeze it it's not really doing anything whereas if there was like this much gummy make sure when I squeeze it the pressure would push it out but because I made such a small amount obviously it's gonna be a little bit trickier I will just eat this out of the bottle later I'm just going to put the gummies that I need into the fridge probably for like 20 minutes alright guys I'm back but it hasn't been 20 minutes it's been two days so I took the gummies Oh after 20 minutes and they were not nearly hard enough I couldn't even really get them out of their molds so I put them in the freezer for a little bit like about half an hour and once they were hard enough I popped them all out of their molds and just left them on some parchment paper but they still were a little bit too squishy and too like corn syrupy so I left them out for a day and they were still a little bit too squishy Tomo for another day which is where we are now so it's been two days and they are perfect so if you guys make these just leave them out on a piece of parchment paper for a couple days depending on how humid it is wherever you live it might be a little bit different like it's not very humid where I live at all um so they dry up pretty quick but if you live somewhere very humid they might take a lot longer to dry or they might even not work for you in the first place so I'll show you what they look like so both the purple and the orange ones turned out very well you can see they're sticky obviously because they are sticking to my fingers so they are a little bit stickier than like a regular gummy but they're they don't really stick together in the bag because I've let them dry out for a few days so the purple ones had half a teaspoon of tincture in them and the orange ones had double that amount so they had one teaspoon of tincture and I thought they were gonna have a lot of issues but they're totally fine yeah they turned out very well and they taste just like the gummies did before I remoulded them last thing just to clarify um my gummies with the coconut oil didn't turn out only the ones with the tincture worked for me I don't know why the coconut oil ones didn't work if you guys know why please let me know because I'm very curious so yeah guys these turned out fantastic I'm super impressed with the results I definitely am gonna use this method many times in the future um going forward what I would do is for every 10 dummies I would do half a teaspoon of tincture so you can just multiply that by however many you want to make in total but based on what I've seen with these with half a teaspoon and the regular teaspoon they both turned out so you couldn't probably get away with using a little bit more but if you're looking for a starting point I would go with ten nine bears and half a teaspoon all right please let me know if you guys try this out I hope you enjoyed the video and let me know if there's any videos you would like to see I hope you guys enjoyed this video please comment like and

boss goes on a trip to colorado and brings our team back some edibles i'm all about a [ __ ] i never tried that it was before but i had heard a ton of horror stories so i decided to be smart about this let's only eat half and wait a couple of hours i think to myself i'm so smart first [ __ ] up this edible is candy and i know and i know and i know that candida wasn't the worst to try for your first time most likely because it's difficult to discern exactly where the most thc is concentrated such was the case of my first edible it was a lollipop with the chc concentrated in the very center the freaking packaging neglects to say so but it does mention that thc dosage is right for a frequent habitual user so being every once in a while smoker i won't need much to lift off so my dumbass sits on my couch and sucks on the stupid candy for a few minutes until the sucker looks like it's about half the size it was originally [ __ ] was caramel caramel apple flavored [ __ ] delicious brilliant i think look at some look at me for being a responsible user do dosing myself out and [ __ ] i start playing the sims and wait for the fun to begin two hours go by and i feel nothing well [ __ ] i think this sucker must be [ __ ] i barely smoke this isn't even a buzz might as well eat the rest of the thing another hour goes by and i'm still feeling pretty normal just playing my game second [ __ ] up i stand to pee the second my knees look i'm i'm in yeah i'm in the [ __ ] a for my legs sort of give out and i'm sitting back on the couch helplessly needing to pee as my coach travels through space and time and a lot roughly the same speed as a freight train i don't remember much after this other than me being other than me trying to crawl up the scares to the bathroom so i can [ __ ] pee i feel like i'm going to spill the contents of my skull if i don't crawl with my head completely still i found myself in the bathtub a couple of hours later the tub drained of me laughing at my blank phone screen after about six hours i finally got down to a comfortable level of high and was able to fall asleep next morning i wake up still a bit buzzed to go to work and tell my boss about it she calls me a dumbass and laughs her ass off also at some point i apparently googled how high is too high as evidenced by that nice browser history ever since i can't take a single

support I just popped that 10,000 market oh my god think you could not have done any of that without your support guys I really really appreciate it it just means the world to me you like me you really really like me sorry just being an ass having some fun alright so today what I'm gonna do now that I showed you how to do canna candy sugar & Canas syrup we can now make our gummies without using butter and the Gerber is an emulsifier however if you want to make them super super strong absolutely go ahead and stuff the butter back in there but this gives you far more control over how strong or weak that you would like to make them now you guys are always asking me how much milligrams etc something is and I don't generally tend to answer that very often because it is all dependent upon what you make how you make it once you're starting THC is etc so what I've done is in the description there I've included a link for the calculator that I use it's a free signup it's a little course you're more than welcome to have a look take a look at it listen to her she's really interesting and lots of information but the calculator you can use for free and that's what I use so then you can go ahead and you can make your calculations and figure out how strong etc that you want to make your candies and with this it gives you a lots of versatility so you can go all can of sugar and syrup or half-and-half which is what I'm gonna do in the recipe so I will stop babbling on now and I'm gonna get into the ingredients of course and of course what we need and then we'll put all that stuff together and make some awesome gummies there we go alright guys all right so for our new gelatin for our new gummy version here you're gonna use one box of your paper flavored jello I three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin a half a cup of water for blooming your gelatin or what I use are these kool-aid waters so they're just flavored water so I now use these in place of water they're great because they add more flavour to it or you can kind of combine some flavors which is really cool to do so I use those things are nice they're lighter and sugar and said just adding more flavor now another thing you can do for adding flavor is juice crystals now I get these at the bulk bar and you can only get them during the summer time but I get these in all different flavors and I've got two tablespoons of those again enhancing the flavor that way if you don't want to use or have these flavors artificial flavors you can go use those which work great the other thing you're going to need is a quarter cup of your can of syrup and a quarter cup of water for our jello and then for our candy side our candy version so it's going to be like the other one where we do the cook you're going to need a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar or again you can use a full can of sorry a full cup of your can of sugar same thing with your syrup I'm using a quarter cup of canned syrup and a quarter cup of light corn syrup again you can go and use as much or as little of either of those as you like I like to do the half-and-half mainly for taste and not to kill people so that's my kind of my you I don't want anybody rendered completely useless and then we are going to need 1/2 a cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and then as well if you want to add additional colors or flavors you can add those optionally as well and as I said if you want to add your butter as well it really makes them super duper you can do that you're just going to follow exactly the same thing except the previous steps from the previous version with regards to adding the butter and the Goregaon to emulsify it now something else I wanted to say and the same thing now in this version I'm not using the clear gel however you can use the clear gel exactly the same way as you do in the previous recipe of the regular and sour gummy recipe that's a good one to follow it's the most up-to-date and gives you both those versions that you can use and that's all we need for our ingredients and now we'll get into our equipment and then we will get the best part go and we'll get all this stuff put together alright so the equipment that you're going to need just like the other recipes a double boiler I just do a makeshift I get a bowl that will make sure that your water does not touch the bottom of your bowl you will need a smaller saucepan for our candy syrup two spatulas you will need your candy thermometer and you will need a larger pot that your bought is that your saucepan small saucepan will fit into ice water water with ice in it but a little tongue-tied today and obviously your candy molds now a lot of you ask me how many candy is gum you will get out of a batch now it's all depending obviously on the size molds that you use if you use about this large size I got these from Michaels you will get about sixty if you use of this size gummy which is kind of a little bit larger than those big ones you're going to get it probably about 75 to 100 and if you use the little teeny tiny ones then you're going to get about 150 to 200 of them so that's approximately what that recipe will break down to you for you and now d'leh before we get started there is something very important that I found out from my other recipe when I started this is and I don't do this in the other recipes but when we're working with the can of sugar and the can of syrups it is a must that we oil down the sides and the insides of our pot for the candy syrup reason being when it heats up and starts boiling the oil THC oil starts to separate and it sticks to the smiths of the metal of the pot you might have noticed that if you did that with a can of syrup which is why I redid the video for that specific reason so we're going to do things a little bit differently than we do for the regular candy recipe but I'll show you all those details once we get into it but the very first thing and don't really don't want to forget is we're going to lightly grease our saucepan and hold on just couldn't dribble a little bit of oil into it and then make sure to work it all the way around make sure to get it right into the corners because anywhere that this oil is not where there's no oil your THC will sit the only thing that dissolves THC oil is oil because it is oil soluble by doing this we're going to be able to scrape anything that sticks to the sides off much much easier then seeing all your products that they're going oh what happened so you said you want to lightly grease that you don't want to have any excess oil so make sure to do that up as well as your spatulas you want to lightly oil your spatulas for the same reason when we scrape it off the sides if these are not oiled it sticks to it and it doesn't come off so you want to make sure anything that is going to be touching the THC the syrup you want to make sure that you all and that's it I'm gonna get into putting our ingredients together and get this started oh one other thing I wanted to cover is with your moles I don't spray my moles beforehand but I have found sometimes that they do stick but so what I do is I care them so I will spray them or oil them down lightly let it sit for 20 minutes in the mold and then wash them out so it still leaves that oily feel but it's not gonna leave your Piquet knees all greasy and makes it far easier for them to come as well as you only have to cure them once every few once every five or six batches or so so it lasts a long time by doing it that way all right so now I promise we'll get into the ingredients in our candy all righty so the very first thing that we are going to do is we are going to microwave our quarter cup of liquid for about 50 seconds till it's boiling and we're going to bloom our unflavored gelatin all right so you're going to evenly sprinkle your gelatin over the top of your liquid whether you use water or the kool-aid water and then you are going to stir it in now a lot of punches I explained in about whether that your gummies did not are not that they're too sticky but they're not gelatin enough that can depend a lot of power on your gelatin I just bought a batch of gelatin because I buy a bulb that didn't it wasn't blooming at the strength of it or something was not working well I did two batches and I had almost double the gelatin so a lot of it is dependent upon your gelatin now one test that I do is when I put in the three tablespoons and mix it in it should start very quickly to get the texture of apple sausage and clicking up pretty quickly now this is not so what I'm going to do is I'm going to add in another half a tablespoon of gelatin yes I've just sprinkled on another half a tablespoon and I'm gonna stir that in and now I'm getting that texture of applesauce can you kind of see what I mean that's how you know you're probably are at the great strength for your gelatin starting off if your gelatin is not right from the beginning if it's mushy I'll show you when we go to put this in but that's the texture it should be once you once we've got it mixed in now we're gonna set that aside for five minutes or so to let that bloom now meanwhile we will add our box of jell-o I'm giving the blueberries well berry blue and we are going to add in our boiling water and stir that around and get it dissolving see was it and then just keep scraping because the jello will cause the sides of the bowl are cool it's good to just kind of stick to it so just keep scraping the sides down as you go and turn your heat on to low so again we only want to melt our gelatin over a hot water bath we don't want it hot at boiling at all that's what breaks our gelatin a lot of the time is you don't even think that you've got it too hot but really past hot water probably by 150 degrees it is that's about all you need so that's that's a big mistake that a lot of people make myself included so I'm just going to continue to stir that gently until the gelatin is dissolved and then we will add in our corn syrup and our other stuff and once your gelatin and that has started to melt the sugar takes longer because the sugar melts at a higher at a bit of a higher heat so it just takes a little bit longer but once your gelatin and that is melted you can add in your corn syrup and your flavor crystals if you're wanting to add so you saw your canister your quarter cup of Kanna syrup and then your flavored juice crystals if you want to add those in as additional flavoring and again just stir that until it all starts gets incorporated and now for you guys asking for those clear gummies how do I get my gummies clear this well you can now you could have perfectly clear gummies so I'm gonna kick it continue to stir this and just gently mix it together until everything is melted and combined I'd you notice I got my nails done so for all of you those wishing that I get them done they're done and to those of you commented there you go I know I looked at the videos and thought make and those are ratty looking hands so I do apologize hopefully it'll be better from now on in the future I hope you like these a little bit better do you got a look at them for quite a long time so why not make them a little bit more attractive and also just remember to continually scrape down the sides of your bowl so that the gelatin is not sticking to the sides and just to show you this is just how hot your water should be there shouldn't be any boiling just a little bit of steam coming off of that that's as how that's as hard as you want to get it otherwise any hotter than that it's gonna break your gelatin alright so now that everything's pretty much dissolved I'm going to add in our gelatin now here's another thing if your gelatin is after 5 minutes or so blooming is mushy when you touch it then your gelatin is not strong enough so whether it's old and it's weakened or there are different gelatin with different strengths if it is nice and firm to the touch and no mushy you're good to go so I just split this up into pieces slap her in and you're just gonna let that you're just gonna gently again stir that until it completely melts and again if you start to see any kind of foaming may take it off your heat immediately it's getting too hot so I'm just gonna let them set them going to continue to stir that until my gelatin is fully melted well once your gelatin is melted and everything looks good and it is nice and translucent just set it off to the side and now we're going to start our candy syrup alright for our candy syrup in goes our half a cup of white sugar our half a cup of Candace Canon sugar our Candace syrup quarter cup a can of syrup like I said before you're more than welcome to play around with your different measurements on that as long as it equals 1/2 a cup either way it doesn't matter and our quarter cup of light corn syrup our half a cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to gently stir that till ever - your syrup till your sugar and water and everything's just combined and then once you're combined here turn your heat on to medium Cline to start and then we're going to drop it down to medium once it begins to boil and you're just going to continue stirring this make sure to get all around the edges because the sugar likes to sit there and so we're going to continue to stir this until it starts to boil now all of my and all the other candy recipes I say as soon as we start boiling we're gonna stop stirring and use our brush not in this recipe and I'll show you once it starts boiling as I said the oils yeah I got a little syrup on the burner there so the oils start to separate out with the heat and until it gets all to the same kind of temperature it will they will stick to the side so we're going to have to continually work the sides of the pot but you're going to want to be very very gentle because we don't want to spit dirt into the syrup so as I said I'll show that all to you once it gets there now you'll start to notice as as it's starting to heat up if you scrape the sides of your pot see all that that's your oil and that's what we want to make sure it gets back into our syrup so I usually have to use the two you want as I said you have to grease both spatulas here and work it off get it back into the syrup and we're gonna have to do this continuously through the whole cooking process so at anytime that you see any darkness starting to form on the side make sure to scrape it down and as your syrup gets hotter you can just put your spatula in it'll just melt it off and also make sure when you are scraping the sides of your pot hold on to the handle firmly I've done it before I wasn't paying attention and whoops and the last thing you want is molten lava being poured anywhere other keeping it in the pot so when your syrup begins to bubble starts boiling you're gonna touch your candy thermometer and remember this is normally where I say we stop stirring not this time so we're not actually going to stir it what we're gonna do is just to continually scrape around the sides of the pot but don't go deep into the syrup we just want to stay around the bubble area and you just want to keep pulling this in so this is the alcohol of the excess alcohol and stuff burning off and any impurities that are in it so see how it's gathering up on the sides that's what we want to make sure get them back into our syrup whatever is supposed to cook off will cook off whatever is good will stay in so again just gently don't go into the stirs syrup just gently keep going around the sides and you'll do behind the candy thermometer towards the end and we are going to cook our syrup - if you want a soft candy you're gonna cook it to 260 if you want a firm candy you can go as high as 280 280 is soft crack I'm gonna go to just before that I'm going to take this to 275 but you see what I mean about the oils how they just continue they'll keep going to the sides of the pot as it heats up and gets up to temperature it will it will the oils will get incorporated and once your syrup is boiling in that you want to just turn your heat down to medium just medium a little above medium I said then don't forget to get behind in behind the thermometer because it will hide in behind there I love the smell of this syrup cooking it's oh it smells so awesome oh and just as a tip for safety always have a fan either an overhead fan I've got one going or the if you've got an overhead on your stove regardless when you're ever working with tinctures even though you've working them in a dehydrated yeah most of it's cooked off some of them may not be and you just want on the safety side always have a fan going and leave don't be sparking anything up in the in the general area so you've had your gelatin sitting over on the side and you have a look and you've noticed that there's all this white inky foam stuff and you're sure positive that you didn't do it high on high heat the heat didn't get too hot that'll happen so nice if the gelatin is old and it's starting to break down so if you do see that in order to compensate for that bloom another tablespoon of unflavored gelatin and we're going to add it into the candy mixture at the end that's gonna help us compensate for the gelatin that's broken in our mixture here so that will help it so anytime that your candies come out super sticky and you can't get them out of the mold the reason is is because the gelatin is not gelling properly so there's a really handy tip there for you guys now in order to get that out because I don't want that in to go my syrup I'm gonna run this through a strainer before we put it into our syrup so now I might actually my syrup while I was babbling away there is getting close to temperature I've got my ice water ready to go and as soon as it hits temperature I'm gonna drop the bottom into the pot and once the temperature starts coming down and the cooking process is stopped I'm gonna set it to the side until the temperature comes down to 240 before we add our gelatin in just watch your thermometer till until the temperature starts coming down and your bubbles start stop bubbling and then just set it to the side and said until your temperature comes down to 240 all right so now my syrup is cooled and then it's say because I don't want that white foamy stuff into my syrup I'm going to use a strainer to pour it through that way it'll catch all the chunks of jell-o gelatin and being bad and I'm going to mix that in now I also what I did was I bloomed another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid and we're going to add that in a little bit in a little bit so right now you're going to stir your jello and your candy syrup until it is all combined and if you find that your syrup is a little too sticky and it's solidified you can put your heat on to minimum you just want to heat the bottom to get the syrup off the bottom now you can make sure that you do so that you scrape the sides and if you said if you find that it's too hard coming off turn your heat on and it'll eventually start to melt so you just want to want to keep doing that until everything is completely melted in all the same temperature all right so now that everything is all melted together and nicely mixed now this is a test that I do to determine whether my syrup is did a job correctly if I pull it up and you see how it just goes in a nice smooth syrup it doesn't really seem to start gelling or anything it stays in a fine line so that's kind of telling me that this is gonna turn out way too sticky it's gonna come out what's it like you can't get it out of the mold it's more candy than the gelatin that's what I said about my gelatin breaking there that I knew that was gonna happen so I've added it I'm gonna add in the additional gelatin that I bloomed and I'm just gonna stir that until it's completely dissolved so now if you want your syrup just translucent that nice clear there you go you've got it you can go ahead and put it into your bottles your squirt bottles or use the little eye droppers for dispensing into your molds but however I never like to keep things plain so I'm gonna do half-and-half or I've got translucent and solid and also just to give you a look to see how to go about doing that all right so now when after adding the additional gelatin in now when I do my test you'll see it's thicker and it'll start to split up and almost solidify in midair so that's how you know it's likely going to set correctly I still had to not do things correctly that's occasionally but that is a very good indication that you're safe and good to go so if you wanted translucent go ahead and put it into your bottles at this point or use your eye dropper dispensers or whatever it is that you get it into your moles however I of course need to always get fancy so I'm gonna split this into two colors so I've got half of it translucent and half of it of the solid blue whoops all right so I'm just gonna eyeball this here if you want to be exact you can pour it into a measuring cup and split it exactly however I've been doing this from this pot for quite a while so I'm pretty good at it sometimes so because I mix the blue with the green because obviously the green from our can of syrup and our sugar so it's turned out a little bit greenish and I actually want this to be blue so I'm going to add in a little bit of blue color and then on 1/2 I'm going to add in white so this one I'm mixing in a few drops of blue you can use any kind of food coloring the gel base oil-based water base for this for this particular candy recipe does not matter so we're just gonna get that stirred in oh that's a pretty color you see it on the white that's nice that's a nice kind of teal color then in my other half I'm gonna pour in some of the blue the same kind of teal but this is gonna give me the solid background as the white now if you guys have white on hand make sure that you shake it really really well if it's hot it sitting for a while it does separate and you will find that if you pour it in you're gonna get a little tiny white it doesn't go well you get little white lumps or something like that it just doesn't blend really nicely so make sure to shake it really really well you can almost hear it come back together it's like you can almost hear the water at the top and then all kind of comes together and sounds a little bit thicker so I'm gonna pour a little bit of that in isn't that pretty so again you're just gonna thoroughly mix that in until it is one complete uniform color and once I've got that i'll get it into my bottles and we'll get this into the mold there's a little trick i learned the other day find it by Occident that's on most things happen so I'm if you want to have a half and half candy where you've got the clear on the bottom and the solid on the top what you can do to easily make that happen is use your hand blender on this we whip a bunch of air into it and once you put them together the air is all I'm automatically gonna bring the solid color up to the top or if you want to do that with the if you want it the other way around then air Rach you're clear but you're gonna have to wait a while for the bubbles to come out because that's gonna make it not so clear so I recommend just putting the solid on the back you can do that it's just a quick way of doing it otherwise you have to pour one layer let it set a little bit and then pour your second layer well aren't I just a cesspool of useless information today I'm just gonna pour this into my squirt bottle this should make a full almost a full bottle or a little bit more see bang almost right on now if you guys have to haven't seen these before these are the best squirt bottles ever they just make putting it into the mould so much easier especially if you want to blend colors absolutely highly recommend these I've got there's a link for them in the description there for you to make it easy if you'd like to order them and I'm just gonna do my clear and we'll get this going all right so I said I always do two colors I always like doing that so I did combination I'll either just whoosh or if you want to happen half you can do it that way you can go this way freestyle whatever you like and that's it get them all into your mold and you're gonna put them in the fridge for a minimum of two to four hours sometimes they've got to go overnight now if you let them go overnight and they're still sticking you can't get them out of the mold put them into the freezer for a few hours let them freeze up take one mold out of it I'd add out at a time and pop them out as quickly as possible if they still if there's still stop the first you'll come out if it starts to stick throw it back in the freezer work on another mold put them into a double boiler melt them down on low heat and add another tablespoon of gelatin melt it and recast them and that will fix that problem for you and that's it enough I'll come back low will pop these out so you can have a look at them and I'll show you how to sugarcoat them not that sugarcoating is that difficult but you can coat them with the can of sugar and just show you an easy way of doing it and that'll be it will say goodbye candies upset and you can do this in a bowl or I found that doing them in a large plastic bag worked a lot easier so in this I put a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar and I put a quarter part about a quarter cup of the flavored drink crystals that I used in my recipe again the drink crystals are totally optional for you just adds that little bit extra flavor and then I added about a half a teaspoon of citric acid because I wanted these to be a little bit more on this our side if you just want to have just a little bit of a tick bite but not really sour at all I add a quarter teaspoon so I'll do those two my sweet ones and then to the sour I use a 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid I don't recommend using much more than that one it's not going to the sour flavor isn't that great and it can also melt your candies because citric acid acid is water soluble so simple enough you can actually see it oh and I also have sorry a wire a wire rack with parts line o parchment paper line line on top of it for them to dry so I just pop them out these guys are popping out nicely and I get and what I do is I do one mold at a time so I leave the rest of them in the fridge because otherwise they start to warm up and they can makes it difficult sometimes for them to come out of the mall so I just think about one at a time and once I get them on the bag I go a little bit there and I just fish them out and shake off the excess sugar and we just lay them out to dry here just like all our other candies this is just a slightly smaller mold that I use same thing now see sometimes you'll do that and you'll see you think oh no they're not gonna come out they're stuck just pull the edges away and then they just they'll just come right out now if you do that and it doesn't come out that's when you would put them into the freezer so again you see that just around the edges to pull it away and they're good to go and that's about it I'm just gonna go through and sugarcoat the rest of these guys and then I'll be back to say goodbye well guys that's my little demo there on your cannon Candace Eric and sugar gummy bears I hope you enjoyed the demo as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to ask and thank you guys so much again for your support and let's get to the 50,000 whoo all right so you have an awesome rest of your day and thanks again for watching [Music]", "FYppuGvTvNU": "[Music] hey what's up YouTube but I just want to do a quick review of a local edible maker I asked my co-op where these came out of and again they did said the day how they I don't know they always say there's probably bad thing about living in the small town you do get a lot of stuff that is just kind of fancy name thrown on it and how we get our stuff from the bay when in reality they get right here in this area and they don't want to it's it's dumb but it's a justify 60 and 8 type stuff so anyways this is a group called candy care this is stuff was called sweet and sour this is 400 milligram these are gummy bears are not gummy bears but it's like you know like the sour patch kids that when I was a kid when my grandma or one of them I get a quarter or whatever I know I'm probably showing my age but why not get a quarter I'd run down to the penny candy store and to pick up sour patch kids or sweetest fish or you know that cost if I select the dots you know the ones that came on the piece of paper she could rip off that kind of stuff anyways this right here these DS of this little off they got the leg game warning on them but in the back it gives you the main ingredients so the way the ingredients work is the most ingredient that's in it is supposed to be number one ingredient so the number one ingredient is to sugar invert sugar which you know I'll look that up in my next review I'll explain it what that even is corn syrup which is well not good for you but high fructose is worse so this is the third ingredient so but probably to keep the sweetness in it and then the next is cannabis extract my friend corns probably tartaric acid citric acid by the natural and artificial flavoring yelling number six red number 14 number five number one so this is supposed to contain about 10 to 12 milligrams per candy and I was okay so I the most I've ever ate of these is five and it was a very good relaxing a few hours well if I probably ate more I couldn't even got more medicinal up I'm sure of course duh but as far as again as far as taste goes these are very sour which is awesome there's been a couple ones I've gotten in from larger companies who this this sour was there so much so that's why show you looking get it real close you could see it's got those crystals all over it so I'm sure that's why the sugar and the invert sugar if sure that's probably what the invert sugars but very sweet very sour and they also have you can vary in certain pieces you can really really taste the cannabis enema so this is for sure something that I've wanted to pass along if you're a cup if you can by chance get these than I would for sure get these because the medicinal effect is pretty good so this is something to check out for yourself the candy care sweet and sour 400 milligram candies please be sure share and subscribe and all that other good stuff love peace and chicken grease", "l7dP70VFo90": "site is going I can't even read my Twitter feed I [ __ ] these people I don't live if I don't put my glasses I don't know what the [ __ ] they're saying oh my people don't get depressing it actually I'm saying psychosis is a different thing okay okay I think we are discussing overall mental health yes I mean look I'm saying this because I really think that this is something that I've made a big turn over the last few years with myself that I don't quit bathroom break yes please go I don't think marijuana is as safe as I used to think it is I used to think it was benign I really used to think there was no big deal but I have a friend that I discussed the other day who was a really confident [ __ ] muscular a handsome man that never did anything and he took a marijuana edible to go to sleep and for two weeks this guy was like this is a different guy not that I was taught it's not Rafi no a different guy he took it and he experienced suicidal thoughts and and all these he had like severe consequences I think that the human beings we vary so much biologically that to just make this overall blanket statement of what's good for you is good for me is irresponsible and I've been irresponsible as saying that well one reason it's interesting what out reason I think that alcohol is so widely accepted despite all the problems it causes and again alcohol can certainly cause problems yeah is that alcohol affects most people pretty much the same way you know if and you sort of know if what somebody looks like when they have one drink when they have five drinks got some dress I've got some friends that get those gerbil eyes you ever see when they start talking crazy but you sort of know that and you sort of know how long it's gonna take to clear your body and you yes cannabis is so different it's a really complicated drug and it does affect different people in different yes and also the tolerance has changed yes so you know people say well two and a half milligrams of THC you vape it that's like one drink for somebody who you know who doesn't use but then if you if you're a tolerant user you can use 200 milligrams in a day that's 80 drinks it's a weird drug and then there's the issue of eating it yes when you eat it your body produces something called eleven hydrogen's on a tab alight it's a far more psycho action you were all along for the ride when that happens yes you are yes and it can take days for it to get out of your system I know many people have eaten marijuana edibles and then they call me up the next day like dude I'm still hot yeah yeah so so so I think I think the legalization community has sort of said for years like oh there's basically no downsides to this there's only upsides the cops will bus smokers they'll be tax revenue all these people have a way to get high that's clearly safer than alcohol and unfortunately that's just not true I think you're right and I think the the issue that people from what I've read are having with your book or people that are marijuana advocates that think that your position is unbalanced and that you've ignored the positive aspects of THC in terms of like what he was talking about cognitive benefits for people with psychotic episodes and that you were only focusing on the negative plead guilty today yeah because I think that for 20 years people have only heard the positive right eye I think that's I think that's also I'll plead guilty that myself because I think that I've only been discussing the positives and one of the things that I've tried very hard to do and one of the things I've learned how to do from doing this podcast and experiencing criticism and communicating with a bunch of different people with a lot of different viewpoints is examine my own positions and try to figure out am i coming at this from a truly balanced position or am i trying to support a conclusion that I started out with and I'm trying to you know somehow or another back up my own work or back up my own just my own statements and and and sort of prop them up instead of being really honest and objective right it's very difficult to do listen I wrote a book called tell your children that yeah about marijuana mental illness and violence you're I don't think you can you can think that that book is gonna be a compendium of the pros and cons above if you want to tell your children the truth though you really do want to tell them the pros and cons right and you did indicate Alex you said you know we should tell people the truth yeah in the book right so you know I think that when you're telling and you're saying that that you're telling the truth and Alex I'm agreeing with you that you're telling part of the truth right but part of the truth is you know a little bit deceiving and deceptive it in some ways right you want to tell the whole truth when you tell the whole truth then you give the whole story and then people can actually make you know a good informed decision based upon that like if people are going to just read one part of the story then of course they're going to make a decision just based upon that one part they're not going to make you know an informed decision based upon all of the price and because of that people are going to make you know some very poor choices I completely agree with that but to me the last 20 years have been an exercise in the other side in the legalization side doing a very very good job talking up its arguments and essentially there's there's almost nobody on the other side there's this one I bet what's got Jeff Sessions you had the [ __ ] goddamn attorney general that's telling people that good people don't smoke marijuana that's literally a quote yeah God that little morons not an office anymore but that's that's a terrible thing to say people don't smoke marijuana there's a lot of wonderful people who smoke - is not true and and and by the way I think this is a personal choice okay especially for adults yeah okay and and you can make bad personal choices you go look I play cards I'd love to play poker I'm said that on this trip to LA I didn't get to go to a poker room but you can go a new casino and you can see people of Los Angeles but you can go to a casino and see people who've lost their houses it doesn't mean that gambling should be illegal it also means that there's less and more dangerous forms that device in your hand where you can bet on what the next pitch is gonna be gonna be a ball or a strike yeah that's more dangerous than my having to drive to the commerce and play there and one hundred percent or 98 percent THC that an 18 year old vapes is a lot more dangerous than a 5 percent you know CBD 15 percent THC product the doctor heart might suggest his patient uses once a night to go to sleep but that that's the message that you know we should be putting out there right we shouldn't just be you know focusing on one side of the story like that part you know should also be you know and in the book and like you know your book you know in some ways has made me rethink the way that I write you know because my first book was co-authored with Jeremy cost and called friendly fire you know my second book that I'm writing now is called cannabis for PT G so it's how to transform post-traumatic stress into post-traumatic growth right because I feel that and you know we all know examples of people that have you encountered really difficult obstacles in their life and some people have you know succumb to that stress and they've gone down you know the wrong path kind of thing and then other people have used that stress to their advantage and they've actually become you know better because of it and you know CBD and THC can both help facilitate that process you know when you're looking at someone like like a veteran for example you know the hallmark of someone with PTSD is someone who doesn't leave their home and they can't sleep at night so like when I see a debt in my office a lot of the times they'll be leaving their home like five to ten days a month right so when you give them CBD and this is really important for people understand CBD has been shown to decrease learned fear that's incredible right so if you can get people outside of their home because I'm not talking about again you know someone who's you know too nervous to like go to a you know at the bar with like the friends or some like that I'm talking to people who like you know it's difficult for them to go to the grocery store just like pick up a few things so you know those are the type of people that I see in my practice with CBD is really excellent for that then when you look at you know the the nighttime component you know THC again is excellent for reducing nightmares that's been shown in studies and it was even shown with one pharmaceutical drug now blown again I don't really use now blown very much because it's only one cannabinoid and I do believe in the entourage effect and using all of the cannabinoids so I don't use that that much but that shows that she she can reduce nightmares and you know if you have you have you have PTSD I mean if you talk to someone who has PTSD and again this is this comes from a clinician support of you they will tell you I will try anything and that's the same way when you get with like you know the parents of kids who have see shoes all day nobody wants to see that yeah and like Alex you know if your kids you know ever started getting getting seizures which you know I hope I hope they don't because it's it's terrible you know what it can do to people but your when if that ever happened you know I would hope that you would consider you know CBD as a potential treatment I think she's not against that I think we have to be really clear as tension like CBD you know again CBD at all I don't know I don't think anybody is I think no one really is arguing except maybe the federal government in certain levels is arguing against CBD that's probably some pushback from the pharmaceutical industry the reality is CBD has proven to be at least as far as I've read very safe and very effective for a bunch of different disorders especially those that are about reducing and have it something do with inflammation or seizures yeah one of my good friends his son has developed seizures and CBD knocked it out just killed it this is very recently you know you're somebody who's you know who's a cannabis user you obviously know a lot of users why do you think it is that people you know in legal states where they can really express a preference they can go into a dispensary know exactly what they're buying why is it that they want such high potency THC product because they get used to it your tolerance develops it builds up you know every year we do this thing called sober October well we don't do any no drinking no no pot and then we do some sort of crazy challenge me and three of my buddies and when we do it what it's it's very interesting how your tolerance is radically reduced like I'll smoke pot at the end of that month and I'm like holy [ __ ] like I don't even know what I'm talking about in the mid-sentence and I'm just bullets creaked whereas you know now like I smoked a little weed last night did some stand-up had a great old time there's no issues with it at all but I'm used to it and if the weed that I smoked last I assume you don't smoke right I do not okay if you and me were together last night and I gave you a hit of my joint you'd be still there in the corner in the fetal position gone what and the [ __ ] is going on because the marijuana is ridiculously powerful but once you're accustomed to it once your body acclimates it's really not that big of a deal the problem is you you're dealing with a lot of habitual daily users and for those people like my friend Joey Diaz there's a video of him giving this other comedian how many milligrams of those stars of death Oh Tilly like when we give Owen what did he give oh I think just one he ruined his life and about 200 to 250 oh I made a video but the day changed Owens life like literally [ __ ] the guy's head up like he went outside he vanished he's gone yeah well I think I think there's a real argument to be made it's particularly with him well I was gonna make two points on that so you definitely can develop a tolerance yeah and I tell people all the time trying to take at least one three-week break but the evidence does show that if you stop for four weeks generally all your receptors return and it'll be like you've never used cannabis before yeah and that's even with people who are really really heavy users I can go back and get the study but I mean these people are you using I'm pretty sure it was like close like seven joints a day well really heavy users and noop dogs a good example of that you know my friend Tony Hinchcliffe his good buddies with Snoop Dogg and he said Snoop Dogg just smokes all day and he just like is always high and you know you're like well what do you do when you're not high he's like what I'm never not high so everything he does he is high as [ __ ] everything he does look for that guy it's not that big of a deal and for the way he lives his life like he's just a relaxed easygoing guy it's no problem you could be high all day and live his life and he's obviously wildly successful with this strategy yeah loudly second point I was gonna I was gonna make on that too though was there does not appear to be any tolerance at the cb2 receptor so she she attaches to the cb1 receptor and that's and that's where we know we can get tolerance you know some people you know they they have some pain they use some THC and sometimes they need a little bit more same sometimes asleep you know they use THC it'll work and then we'll stop working with CBD - we haven't seen that meaning like the people who you know get get seizure control generally they don't need to increase of dose like the girl I was talking about earlier you know I first subscriber I think when she was 20 and she was by him 20 she's 25 now she's never increased her dose and she's just used the same amount to CBD for the last think we should really stop talking about CBD I just wanted to make a note on the on the Italian someone I just want to make a note that CB to the doesn't appear to be tolerance it's all yeah it's just there's just such a significant impact when when it comes to especially edible THC it's a there's a significant impact on people's state of mind and it's not always good no that's just a fact we", "x6BgfrYZ7sI": "this is 420 Ohio's medical marijuana product reviews Juanes our gummies are produced by Buckeye relief out of East Lake Ohio gummies are housed in a white plastic bottle with a pine green cap there are ten gummies per bottle each containing

sugar crystals in terms of flavor the name says it all these gummies are juicy bursting with strawberry sweetness and a tart lemon flavor that's just right I wasn't wincing or pinching my lips while chewing on this gummy like I might with other sour candies if you're looking for that experience though I'd suggest mixing this gummy with some sour patch kids medicinally wanna sour gummies provide a one-to-one ratio of THC and CBD per gummy this translates to a medicinal experience that's both mildly euphoric and relaxing used a few hours before bed this gummy is excellent for distressing after a tough day it's also great for inflammation relief rest and sleep euphoria creeps up with this one building to a crescendo about an hour or two after eating the edible I could initially feel a slight headband effect that grew in intensity before peaking and slowly dissipating this was followed by immediate pain and stress relief overall I rather loved one a sour gummies they are great for the evening providing gentle euphoria inflammation relief and smooth relaxation before bed if you've been searching for a good gummy edible be sure not to miss this one final rating 4.9 out of 5 be sure

just wanted to you know I decided you know I'm gonna make it you know it's by mistake you never want to give your dog marijuana or anything like that I'll kind of talk and give you guys kind of the story of when I went down and I'll have some footage of the day you know going in and out and then the end of the video I'll have some more footage so basically what had happened was I have an ex-girlfriend okay I absolutely loved her dog like I grew up with dogs my whole life but me and her dog just had like this special bond and I just fell in love with pit bulls ever since I was up people just got pit bulls just cuz their look and they look aggressive and all that stuff but pit bulls are the most affectionate dog absolutely love them so I get a phone call alright I haven't talked to my ex-girlfriend in like 2 or 3 months she calls me she's like hey she calls me cry and she's like oh my god like Avis had a seizure or a stroke or whatever I can't lift her up and put her in her car you have to come over blah so I hop in my Jeep I fly down there like I freakin robbed a bank I'm like super like oh my god like this sucks like I love you know her dog so I get there and you know sure enough she's laying in her dog bed can't really walk is like drooling a little bit and I'm just like damn it like this is it you know I had to put her down or whatever so I pick her up take her to the vet and the vet gets to asking her questions she's like she's like okay how old is your dog has your dog maybe eaten anything or whatever and she's like oh she gets in the trash sometimes but she's never like nothing's ever happened to her and then she's like has she maybe eaten any marijuana whatever and then Desiree kind of pauses and she's just like and then it dawns on her okay her brother was over a brother I'd cancer and you know eating edibles and stuff like that really helps like his appetite and he doesn't have cancer anymore which is awesome but basically they they made like 20 pot cookies and somehow you know it dawned on her that she left the bag and that's what must have happened to Ava she goes oh my god that you know that must've been it she must have had the pot cookie so basically we go from thinking her dog is dying and having a stroke or whatever - oh she just is super high right now on weed and needs to come down off his high so it was actually like a really scary day that turned out best case scenario because you can't really overdose on weed like it's not gonna kill you or anything like that so after all of this desert was actually going on a trip and she was like hey can you watch Ava over the next few days because I don't want to just leave her alone when she's working you know tripping so I was like yeah sure whatever you know awesome she goes to my house and I bring the kennel all along because Ava with some pit bulls no matter like even if you you you try to train him good some of them are just a little bit dog aggressive so Ava happens to be very dog aggressive you know won't hurt a fly as far as humans and stuff like that but does not like other dogs you know and I had my my English taffy shadow but you know I had a kennel you know I could just separate them into rooms or whatever but I thought you know what this might be a perfect opportunity to kind of see if they can become friends because Ava is dog aggressive - random dogs but if she like she has been together with other dogs before in the past and it's worked out but I was kind of scared you know being you know my little puppy I don't want it like Ava freaking biting her biting biting him so I was like okay Ava's were very high right now when you're high the last thing you're thinking about is kicking someone's ass so I was like maybe Ava's super chill and whatever and I can kind of introduce the dog so I was super nervous to introduce shadow and Ava but it worked out perfectly so Ava had no aggression she was just chilling kind of excited and all this stuff so they became actually best friends after this Ava stayed over at my house and they cuddled together they were freaking licking each other's faces and all that stuff so definitely be careful guys if you guys smoke marijuana or anything like that if you guys have edibles laying around the house you definitely don't want your dogs to get into it Ava was high for like two or three days she had trouble walking running just we're actually weird like normally she just licks your face but she was like kind of biting you softly I was just just not acting like yourself so I can't imagine like what it would do 12 pot cookies to a 60 pound dog or a 55 pound dog I can't imagine me taking two of those cookies I'd be tripping out of my mind but yeah guys that's what happened kind of hesitated I'm making this video just because it's kind of a weird topic and some people could take it the wrong way and I know you have to be careful you can't just leave stuff like that laying around but thank God it wasn't like some pharmaceutical medications or anything like that because that would kill your dog even like ibuprofen or whatever but the marijuana happened to be in cookies and dogs [ __ ] you know love cookies so April was high for three days and then after that she was just fine and shadow and Ava have been best friends ever since you know me and my ex went out together or anything like that but sometimes like if she goes on a trip I'll watch her dog if if I go on a trip she'll watch shadow so but yeah I hope you guys like the video give it a thumbs up share this video with your friends and yeah just be careful you don't want this to happen to your dog I know it's kind of like it might be a little bit of a funny thing at the end of the day because it did go from we thought Ava was dying to oh she's just tripping out so for us it was kind of like a really awesome thing that she wasn't having a stroke or anything like that but at the same time be careful you don't want that to happen to your dog it's just you know it puts them through torture for a few days so yeah I hope you guys liked it and I'll see you guys next time you walk inside one thing she too long wanna see her walk come here evil walk to me okay yeah this definitely isn't funny but it's kind of funny it's just so relieved that she didn't have a stroke or a seizure or anything like that so this is like best-case scenario yeah we can link relax now well not relax that's better she's taking extra extra extra my neck come on longest pee ever just come oh my god she's so stoned look at her hey left how are you peeing again this Danish cheesy so weird come on Yvette come on you're just running everywhere come on what are you doing David Oh with that noise that noise tripping out so I found the bag I think this was the cookie bag I mean it looks exactly like it so this was in the dirt and it's been raining so it looks all gross now but she ate the cookies dude a dozen pot cookies a pothead you poor thing baby okay [Music]", "IZ5AS2mBK-w": "what's the hold on YouTube it's the Lauren aka Nubia 420 and today I will be making some storm and gummies into infused gummies with my own homemade tincture that I did here with a little Keith so if you've seen a green dragon video then you know how to make a tincture this specific one was made with Keef there is a video on that so if you're not sure how to do it check it out I will link it up here in in the cards and let's get started so we have gummies you can make any you can make this with any football company our Dollar Tree just happens to have these and we're gonna go ahead and cover them in some nerds so it's going to be the infamous nerd rope but not a rope shake because we're going to use these heart molds here so it'll be a little more adult then we're gonna have a good time so let's go ahead and get started we have our pot here with about an inch of water in it and then we have our mixing bowl and we're going to use this to double boil and then melt down work on these so that we can work with them so let's turn my stove on it turn to medium heat you don't want to heat it up medium-high heat and now we have a double boiler now I'm not the cook in this relationship so I don't make things from scratch so you will never see me making tactically scraps which is a video on our channel if you're interested I like cheap [Music] if you care about the colors of your dummy you should separate them and melt them down by color so just as these nope this isn't the easiest method it no honestly you can probably make some gummies from scratch it should be easier to work with the knees then whatever I had these I wanted to try it so here we are [Music] okay so we are this is what it looks like all melted down we're gonna go ahead and drop something tincture in and we're gonna mix that up so we calculated our texture at about three milligrams per drop and this is about 20 drops right here so we're just gonna throw that anything down this is a Everclear based texture it's not an oil-based tincture I don't know what this will work for William Hastings I'm sure there are recipes out there that use it you have to find one of those recipes this is alcohol you share it with us yes please no other if you know of a recipe that uses real oil-based future luckily in bully evaporate as this continues to heat it just a little bit more the treatises we added it which is good for porn is hormones [Music] Tomic shirts wet distribute it with it I do don't want one go meet us you know ten milligrams and then another tummy is 15 because another one is zero so I mix it up do this is you have to work fast so it's probably not a great idea to do a whole bunch at one time working in small batches it's probably better so don't we come over here I'm actually going to skip the measuring cup then just try to pull it straight into our moon from this bad boy right here so I'm always sprayed with cooking spray so try to help the release be a little bit easier I kept my double boil it is just home low just the case this heart is up to where I can't really work with it [Music] [Music] obviously if you're making these other people don't touch it fingers are you making it for yourself do whatever you want okay so we didn't get the entire tray filled we only have enough for two four six eight piece of seven and a half I want to call that one whole but now they're gonna go in the freezer for about two hours until you know they're nice and frozen never want to take them out and we'll cook them in the nerves and they will let them dry out so that's it into the freezer big deal okay so we grabbed our gummies out of the freezer I took them out after about an hour just because our freezers turned up so high and it's so tiny that it freezes super fast and um we're gonna pop them out and then what you want to do is take your nerve and spread them out on a tray or on a sheet so the phone and you see they're a little tacky but not totally you're just gonna sit them right in that sheet right there and then we're gonna go ahead and coat them for these delicious candies so it's not a rope but it's literally all the same ingredients as the rope but I feel like this is much more manageable a much more manageable tree and they just kind of so you want to let them fall out a little bit because they get tacky as they're falling but you see right now and it's not really sticking it does a little bit but you got to kind of work it and then what's your color these they're going to sit on the countertop now you can cover them with it's how and they'll sit on a countertop for I believe 24 hours 24 to 48 hours to dry out it's something that you want to do to you've got man so this part does take on a little bit of time to do making sure you get good and then we have our test one here that we've already covered as you can see but not too many it's not too bad you mean you just pop it in your mouth and eat it people seem to like them I'm not sure why but this needs on itself alright and here we have the final product our hearts covered in nerd ropes these are that when you sit out for probably a day or two just to dry out and go ahead and eat them be eights I'm already very different very sweet probably 10 years ago but I love these not too sure how I feel about them right now they definitely have a cake that tincture is kick in we will be making some gummies from scratch I won't that will be way up goodies and that will be coming very soon in the meantime it has been a pleasure hope you guys enjoy the recipe let me know if you have any questions my comment subscribe do all that good stuff so have a good one everybody stay safe hope you've enjoyed your quarantine here but you know Rona V out there coming for all of us alright have a good one peace [Music]", "pc9arCO5UDw": "[Music] hey guys welcome to the hot box it's a little

show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on this review we are taking our second look at a gummy a gummy manufacture that I quite liked the first time I reviewed and that is tiki killer's tiki killer's this was a real surprise for me the first time I reviewed it is a 300 milligram edible this time it's peach flavor we reviewed the green apple the first time it surprised me in many ways one gummies rarely get me high just I find them to be usually less potent than this sort of confectionaries but this one got me nice and high too for its price normally things you know in the edible world you get what you pay for a 300 milligram edible for 15 bucks especially in this sort of not so nice packaging it's just sort of a ziploc bag with some kind of stickers on the front and back you know it's not the nicest packaging and usually that's a sign of you know a bad omen but in the first case it worked out well so I just wanted to make sure it wasn't a fluke and I just didn't get a great batch or something so I decided to go ahead and pick up another one and give it a review as well to see if you know they are another gummy brand worth investing in so let's go ahead and open up the tiki killers peach 300 milligram here and give it a taste and if this is your first time tuned in two weeks the way our reviews work real simple I'm gonna eat this product here and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours for you it'll be just a couple of seconds I'll just edit right together and you'll see exactly just exactly how high this product got me because that's the most important part of the edible review right is finding out exactly how high you're gonna get you know is it gonna work for you or is it gonna just be a waste of money that's what we're here for it we so I do like the sculpt of these gummies there are these cool little like Tiki shaped things here boo boo boo boo like I'm covered in some granulated sugar as well the taste in the green apple is great let's give a the peachy go well that has a very peachy flavor actually there must be some real peach in there actually I mean there's just like cannabis taste to it but compared to a lot of other gummies I mean this is this is amber ogia this is good stuff again there's a slight slight cannabis taste so if you can't stand any taste a weed you know maybe give it a skip but for gummies this is great there are four of them in the package this is 75 milligrams each I'm gonna finish these guys off if you watch too and then I will see you in two hours thanks for watching witch guys and I'll see you in just a bit peace Oh quick addendum I should mention I had fat before before I consume these just a little bit before I had these so I did have some fat already so I didn't forget to take fat I just didn't take any additional fat during the video but I did have some right before this so so rest assured consistency in our experiments is key here at wheats thanks for watching sorry about the the late-breaking news talk to you soon [Music] just ate some spicy food that's why I got them all I'm all sweaty here just well probably not spicy for any of you listening but spicy for me I'm a real real [ __ ] when it comes to the spicy stuff I like it I just just can't really handle it handle it but what I can handle although I am handling it not as easily as I would have thought is the Tiki Killers that's two for two for the Tiki Killers I am quite high I would say I'm at a six so I again this is a $15.00 edible for a 300 milligram err I got a discount I believe I got it for 13 bucks so a pretty good value most gummies like comparatively the 200 milligram cuz she punch is twenty dollars I don't know I mean like I'm not gonna suggest that this 300 milligrams is equivalent to their 200 milligrams or anything like that but I dunno if you like gummies it's a pretty good value it got me quite high it's quite tasty it's got shitty packaging and I just now noticing you can kind of see there if it doesn't shimmer too much some like oily residue left in that package which is probably just the way that the the way they get the tea and it's probably just cannabis oil of some kind leftover but I I really like Tiki Killers it's good stuff still probably wouldn't be my first choice for gummy edibles I think I would still reach for flourish first but if I saw these in my dispensary and wasn't looking for some kind of confectionery was looking for something a little bit easy you know quicker to eat less calories and they had Tiki killers there I grabbed them I've give him a shot um they're definitely two for two and they seem to be pretty reliable so guys that's going to do it for this review here on wheats if you enjoyed this review please do me a favor give me one of those little thumb yuppies subscribeee also you can even follow me on twitter a tweets reviews or give me a like on the facebook at wheats reviews on facebook as well i would super appreciate it thank you so much for watching guys we will check you out a later review peace", "H6cYs4ZcSv8": "[Music] revue show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I've got my Nutella here pancakes love Nutella and I love Nutella too so I've got my Nutella so you know what that means it means we are taking a look at another gummy that's right we are breaking the cardinal rule here on weeds don't be a dude don't be a dummy and buy a gummy we are taking a look at a very very popular gummy brand may be the second most popular gummy brand behind cushy punch and that is the gummy brand from Chiba choose themselves Green Hornet I had a lot of people asked me to review the Green Hornet's and we're finally gonna be doing it this is their 100 milligram indica variety love everything on the back it's got all the stuff you want to see the batch number from the lab testing nutrition information all that good stuff ingredients it's all they're so good on them for putting all the information on their Bravo to you Chiba chews now if you've seen my reviews in the past you know my Chiba chews I'm really feeling them to be sending my world on fire I found them to be good but not great more okay however I picked this one up for a very affordable price just 10 bucks for a hundred milligram edible which is a pretty good deal so it's a little bit cheaper than most of the Chiba juice and so I'm I'm more excited about this one and I'm an indica fan so let's uh let's give it a go I do have the uh oh looks like my dogs have come back from a walk welcome dogs welcome dogs low hello hello goodbye dogs farewell dogs sorry about that guys so yes back to the Green Hornet really excited about this one because it was more affordable and I've heard a lot of good things about the Green Hornet's now if you know as you know I'm not a big gummy fan really only flourish and tiki killers the only gummies that I've really really loved and cushy punches I find to be OH a so Green Hornet is fighting an uphill battle there but let's give them the benefit of the doubt open this bad boy up and give it a taste so if you've never tuned in two weeks before the way our reviews work it's very very simple I'm gonna eat this whole thing and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review so uh it tells us to cut the gummy into ten ten milligram servings there's it's little cut guide where of course not gonna be doing that I guess that's how they're gonna get compliant with the new regs whatever so here is the gummy The Green Hornet fruit punch flavored and again I picked this up for only ten bucks at my dispensary which is a very good price for these Green Hornet's so let's let's break off half here and give it a taste I forgot my I brought my Nutella to have some fat whoo wow that is woo that has a heavy heavy heavy cannabis taste but that is encouraging hopefully that means it's going to be as potent as advertised and seeing this lab tested results in the back gives me faith so let's add a little bit of chocolate to it here just to give ourselves the best chance of making sure we can get high mmm that Nutella makes that a lot easier to go down alright guys well that's gonna do it for this first half of this review for the second half and the most important part will it get me high I'll come back to you guys in two hours or for you just a couple of seconds through the magic of editing so I will see you guys in just a bit to let you know peace [Music] help I've been stung by a Green Hornet welcome back to wheat skies it's been two hours since I've had that Green Hornet and it's pretty good it's up there with good gummies like flourish I actually like it better than Sheba chews period I think it got me where I want to be some pink there I'd say I'm at a seven and a half somewhere in there not to put too fine a point on it uh yeah I I like The Green Hornet quite a bit uh the indica variety at least is muy bueno uh muy bueno bueno bueno way down yeah I'm really pleased with it pleasantly surprised I like it better than any of the other cheapo cheese I've tried so far a really a nice little edible nice discreet package it tasted like barf but that's to be expected for something that's so small and so potent so I don't really hold out it against it but it does taste terrible so if you're really sensitive as a taste no this one is this one's got a pretty intense weed flavor but on the whole if you can get it as cheap as I got it because I got it for ten bucks but I sometimes see these go as highs like seventeen or higher maybe I don't know the that's why I don't really screw that she would choose that much is there crazy expensive but if you can find this for around that price it's uh I'd say it's worth it I really had a good time with this one that's the Chiba choose Green Hornet's a fruit punch flavored one hundred milligrams indica give it a shot if you see the dispensary near you and before I go guys I want to share with you a little cherry on top something a little extra something that's not reviewing weed just something I like in my life that I want to share with you guys that isn't necessarily weed related and on this review my little cherry on top is let's give it up for the air pod I hope there's not too much earwax on that because that'd be really embarrassing the air pods they're really good I hope I'm saying that right air pods that's the name of them the names dumb but they're actually really incredible little wireless headphones earphones I had a pair of Plantronics wireless over-the-air ones noise cancelling ones that I had for two years that I adored and have been using the air pods on and off for a while and and really come to appreciate them and they're discreteness in their ease of use and the just pull it out pauses the music all that good stuff really enjoy it if you have an Apple product if you have an Apple phone give the air prodigious shot if you haven't already I know they seem a little expensive but I think they're worth the the the Apple tax in this case so guys that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats that's gonna be a thumbs up for the Green Hornet thank you so much for sticking around at the very end of this review guys and we will catch you on the next one peace", "fd7ZRxbbx7o": "[Music] a portion of this video is sponsored by [Music] popsockets dorothy versus alice let the rap

five dollars but it's beautiful because they always want to plunge your own [ __ ] that's disgusting they always send some [ __ ] jamaican dude it's a place called tacos el gordo apparently it's pretty big in san diego and stuff and it was some of the best tacos we've had we went through the first night because we our flight was at nine o'clock around four in the morning i woke up and i took a huge [ __ ] to [ __ ] that background i [ __ ] that baby was tapping off yeah and i i flushed i'm like oh [ __ ] this isn't going down and i flush again and i think there's a sensor in these fancy things so it doesn't overflow thank god but i i was nervous i was going to overflow it was right there to the tip right there so i took the trash can and i filled it up just kind of nervous they think i could get it to go down thinking there's a plunger no plunger i walked down to the front desk hey can i have a plunger do we have to send an engineer up i'm like i just want a plunge you must have a buck i thought they had a bucket of them behind the front desk no and i'm like i don't want a big guy coming in at four in the morning making apollo up so i waited outside in the hallway luckily he let me do it so i punched it no you're supposed to give him five ten bucks for what to bring the plunge up and not no they should just give me a [ __ ] plunger what are you [ __ ] knowing about scratching yeah he's not edible you're supposed to give him a ten spot to not go in your room i did he didn't go in my room i didn't i did myself no did you give me the plunger back yeah let me ask you something he carried it in the bag yeah no like we think he's gonna walk around with [ __ ] falling from it you [ __ ] but i i poured the the trash can back into the toilet and i flushed it again and i put the trash can in the bag too i was like we don't need this in a room disgustingly and then you don't give the poor guy part of the [ __ ] business what's the matter nothing doesn't matter who why don't you have a plunger in a hotel room because what do you want to have 200 [ __ ] plungers this part of the game they don't want the [ __ ] to get out of control what if there's something that that's not what if your [ __ ] had metal in it what what what if you ate like a bicycle okay and you shoot a bicycle in the [ __ ] thing and it's about to clog up the toilet that's why they send the guy he's no engineer but they send them up there to flush it to make sure your bathroom's okay you're supposed to give them a 10. now don't get me wrong i would never want somebody to smell the core of my [ __ ] because once you flush the toilet and that [ __ ] breaks in half that's a completely different odor than you got for originally when it comes out you get those gastric juices and [ __ ] yeah when it breaks in half yeah yeah when it breaks in half leave me alone it breaks it you eat one more out of them when it breaks in half yeah you're sitting there going it's disgusting i don't want nobody in there either so i give them a 10 spot to keep them in the hallway yeah every time i order coffee like when i get coffee packing you know they only put two packages in your room that's why now i gotta travel with [ __ ] sweetener because i gotta be i've become a [ __ ] shoplifter i'll sweeten the shoplifter every time i go to eat when i'm on the road i look around i gotta steal the [ __ ] blue packages oh because housekeeping yeah they only put one blue package in your room with two [ __ ] pink packages for every cup of coffee i need like three or four of those [ __ ] so every time i drink coffee like i like to drink coffee in the morning when i wake up one [ __ ] cup when i wake up in the morning yeah right just one cup i don't know how people drink coffee all day and that night before i do comedy or sometimes before i go to bed at night i'll get a cup of coffee and smoke a joint you know smoke like a vapor and i love that and write two or three jokes i love all that [ __ ] so that's what i use coffee for so i would come in at night they give you two pack they give you one pack of decaf and one pack of regular [ __ ] coffee i'm gonna be there for four days when i go to the front desk you think they got coffee behind the front desk you think so no oh you make an engineer come up to your [ __ ] room hey should i give him five hours for what to bring the coffee up oh wouldn't you i'm a nice tipper but i i draw the line you gotta tip them you gotta tip them representing the church you got to give him a [ __ ] fin a tense butler oh god yeah you're out there people see you they know you're international oh no i know what i did think of those [ __ ] poor people on the strip [ __ ] costumes taking pictures i felt so bad for this one guy who dressed him and his buddy were burt and ernie in the [ __ ] worst looking costumes i've ever seen they must have sorted themselves but he's like picture buddy so him and his friend must have come from

dispensary uh and on today's review I've got the spatula the wheat sworn spatula and the trusty jar of Nutella that means that we are reviewing something that does not have fat in it because THC and fat go hand-in-hand so we're reviewing today we are taking our third look I've reviewed two of these this type excuse-me of edible and past Oh or I guess you would call it an ingestible cuz it's not necessarily edible per se so we are taking a look at th C capsules medicinal softgels today this is our look at the pro canna THC plus hundred milligrams 250 milligrams soft gels as i said i've reviewed two caps in the past both of those were 300 milligrams one was pretty good the the if it was delta-9 yes the delta nine capsules were good I enjoyed them they were a little expensive I believe they cost thirty bucks for the 300 milligrams and then there was also I think it was the gold caps which were also 300 milligrams which were 50 bucks I believe and they were completely terrible they didn't do anything at all to me so I've got a hundred milligrams this time so less than the others but this was a more affordable price I guess linearly it's the same price as the delta nine as it was ten bucks for the two of the hundred milligram pack so you know it's the technically the same price but certainly a lot better price wise than the gold caps pretty simple little packaging here just a cardboard box with some you know directions there on the back advising that we consult a doctor before taking pro kanna don't know why doctor is capitalized there let's go and open up see what these look like uh-oh they are weirdly shaped so here we go here is one of the capsules right here in this little package they're ugly little capsule first let's do a little bit of the good old and Nutella my favorite part of all fat-free reviews is getting a nice scoopful a Nutella yum yum yum yum yum yum who doesn't love Nutella heartless folks that's him okay so that should hopefully be enough back for now and let's go ahead and plunk this in forgot to bring my handy trusty Arnold Palmer tea with me so I'm just gonna have to dry chuckle I swallow that's the word for it so let's do it three two one down the hatch got one more here three two one down the hatch okay well so I've had both the pillows now that's 100 milligrams of THC or so they say now in my body with the requisite amount of fat to help activate it now all we're gonna do is our for me I'm gonna wait two hours for you guys through the magic of editing it'll be just a couple of seconds and I'll let you know how these pro can uh THC caps are hitting in just about two hours so thanks for watching guys and I'll see you in just a bit peace [Music] alright guys I am back it has been two hours for me since I had the pro canna THC soft gels and let's do a little ocular test Whitis [ __ ] snow I don't know I want to let me say this right off the bat I want to love THC capsules I love the idea of them I love something that's discreet easy to take doesn't have any calories with it way of ingesting THC but these suck these didn't do anything for me I I mean it's I don't feel high at all nothing so in terms of what I have tried these are down there with gold caps they're not as good as the delta-9 obviously those got me at least you know somewhat high this is just a real [ __ ] product I don't know if it's on me oh and this time I also try it with fats I had had people in the bat before asked me like well maybe you need to try it with fat which I should have done anyways tried it with fat and still no result um I feel like I could you know if I was if I was a gymnast I feel like I could perform gymnastics if I was a mathematician I feel like I could perform some differential equations but I'm just a stupid idiot and I still feel like I can function as a stupid idiot even after two hours on the THC plus from poke pro canna man again guys I cannot articulate enough I would love for these to be the magic bullet you know an easy discreet portable way of getting THC with into your body that isn't either smoking vaping or having to consume something with a lot of sugar and calories I keep hoping for it I I don't think I'll be going back to pro kanna next time I have to review but I think I'm gonna keep trying to find that magic capsule out there to see if any of them work I'll do a couple more maybe maybe they're just not for me maybe there's something about mean that they just I just doesn't work as an ingestion method I would love to hear from you guys if you know any good capsule brands or if they work well for you please let me know leave a comment below or send me an email at wheats at wheats reviews.com and let me know what you think about these capsules because I'm trying to find a great one I'm hoping to find something that you know I can take with me to the airport something I can you know take with me into a concert you know that's not going to draw any attention to itself but so far of the three I've taken this I don't know if it's necessary worse than gold caps but it's not definitely not any better so far if you definitely want capsules stick with the Delta nine they're still not great they're still not my favorite way to ingest THC but definitely skip out on the procane a total dud of a product look at the [ __ ] back there that is the category that it's in and I am now just rambling so with that guys I am going to sign off from this review and that is going to do it for pro canna here on wheats thank you so much for watching guys and we will see you on our next review peace", "iNcCGMXn2bA": "[Music] we're here with bloom farms and we have some trinkets that you can smoke we here my man my somebody we live in a

Ella Allen assistant director-general of WH OHS non communicable diseases and mental health cluster w-h-o has no scientific evidence to confirm the product safety and efficacy its marketers should immediately remove their websites and other informational materials any suggestion that w-h-o considers it to be a safe and effective smoking cessation aid but out of the many many e-cigarettes that emerged on the market there was one clear winner and if you're at all aware of the current trends or headlines you already know who I'm talking about I'm jewel all the time so we have a few of them Jules started up as plume a more cylindrical device than the USB stick looking one that we know it as today the plume brand was sold in 2015 to Japanese tobacco international or jti for short which launched two new products in Japan this year the founders then rebranded themselves as pax labs and launched the jewel in the same year since then the worldwide vaping market has grown into an industry worth more than ten billion dollars that's billion with a B also known as kind of a big deal also I'm saying which is why any health concerns that have come up are just as big of a deal September 2018 the FDA called e-cigarettes an epidemic among children and teens sending warning letters to stores that were selling the product to minors illegally December 2018 the Surgeon General issued a warning of that e-cigarette use was unsafe August 2019 the Minnesota Department of Health asked healthcare providers to be on the lookout for vaping and East cigarette related lung diseases after noting cases at a local hospital later that month the first suspected victim lost their life which brings us to great about now so what's changed and what are the issues currently facing he cigarettes well there are a few issues first there's not really much oversight on e-cigarettes at least not in the United States according to Ned Sharples acting commissioner of the FDA east cigarettes are not safe and then all these cigarette products on the market are illegal as none of them have actually been assessed by the FDA regulators have pointed out how odd it was to wait until 2019 to take this stance specifically Frank pallone a Democratic Representative from New Jersey stated that it was long past time for the FDA to act and Diane to jet a democratic representative from Colorado said that given the potential risks associated with these products it would be reasonable to assume these products had been reviewed and approved by the FDA but they haven't and of course it's not just independent startups like jewel that have entered the vaping ring plume is still run by jti and British American Tobacco unveiled their vy p cigarette in canada british american tobacco being the second largest cigarette manufacturer in the world as of 2012 by the way there are even questions regarding how effective e-cigarettes are for quitting smoking especially with the increasing trend in underage vaping the big concern is that instead of reducing smoking rates and adults vaping maybe creating more smokers overall at the forefront of this particular concern jool specifically Jools flavors in advertising campaigns right now teen vaping rates are soaring according to an article by Maclean's the vaping rate amongst teens under 16 in British Columbia is one in five for ages between 16 and 18 it's 1 and 3 and those are just the teens were telling the truth could you imagine being a teen answering that kind of question son do you vape absolutely not according to American Lung Association national president and CEO Harald Wimmer a recently released report shows that 27 point five percent of youth are now using e-cigarettes which is a problem because the most popular cigarettes contain nicotine to get into a bit of science CA science when nicotine is absorbed into your blood after smoking it gets carried to your brain once there is absorbed by the aptly named nicotine receptors on neurons and a part of the brain known as the reward pathway these neurons then release dopamine a fancy term for a feel-good chemical it's also highly addictive and creates addiction at a faster rate in young brains than an adult ones and here's a thing as you smoke vapor jul more nicotine the number of receptors in your brain increases more receptors means a higher dosage is needed to fill them and get the same response and since your body is now used to those receptors being full when they're not it's welcome to chemical addiction now here's the thing selling or even marketing products like cigarettes e-cigarettes or products containing nicotine to youngsters is at least in Canada in the United States very very illegal as in if you get caught not carting kids lose your license illegal but with flavors on the market like jewels official lemonade and mango pods or less legal third party usually berry flavored Smurfs blood some of question who the products are intended for according to pediatrician dr. Suzanne Eaton ski the appeal of flavors for children is well understood by e-cigarette manufacturers and the flavors also help mask the harsh taste of nicotine making repeated use more likely and thereby increasing the likelihood of developing addiction teen addiction concerns were further due to earlier advertising campaigns used by jool and other e-cigarette manufacturers as that make vaping look cool and hip and which bear a passing resemblance to some of the marketing used by big tobacco in the past recently Jules CEO Kevin Burns stepped down and was replaced by one Casey crosthwaite whose previous position was chief growth officer at Altria one of the largest producers of cigarettes in the world though devil's advocate for a second here that particular move does make a degree of sense in a turbulent time in the industry it would make sense to have an experienced growth officer run your business and speaking of turbulent times the situation today is certainly turbulent at least 20 dead over a thousand ill and an ongoing investigation into both illicit and mainstream vaping products in terms of what kind of health effects they have so what is going on well let's explore a few cases and give a look at the bigger picture 52 year old mother and lifelong her Mary Kerry Davis took up vaping as a way to quit smoking but given that we're talking about her now you can probably guess that things didn't go so great for her according to Mary Kerry's husband Kevin Davis she thought it was safer I certainly liked the fact that there wasn't the cigarette smell and her breath didn't smell like cigarettes I kind of thought it was better to Mary carry only vape nicotine containing a juice for several years but eventually tried a THC containing juice in California after returning home to Georgia where THC is illegal she kept purchasing and vaping it according to a report by CNN Mary Carey's health entered a steady decline while vaping THC until she developed coughing nausea vomiting and diarrhea after a hospital visit on September fourth her daughter Maggie recounts that she stated she was never smoking again by September 6th she had passed away and while Mary Kari is not counted in the CDC's official list of victims she was found with a white cloud like substance sticking to the inside of her lungs the same hallmark trait that others suffering from the vaping illness then there's the case of a 17 year old from Detroit that was admitted to Henry Ford Hospital while his name has been withheld for privacy reasons his family asked the doctors share his story when admitted doctors found that the teens chest cavity appeared almost empty on a CT scan an almost total lack of air causing his lungs to disappear from scans according to dr. Hasan Emma the damage was so bad that he quote would have faced certain death without a drastic operation namely a double lung transplant if you're unfamiliar with what double lung transplant means imagine you have no lungs and then imagine receiving someone else's lungs that's it that's how it works of course there are serious complications it's not quite as easy as take out old lungs and put any ones in people who get lung transplants need to take medication to subdue their body's immune systems so that it doesn't reject the new organs it's not an operation that has taken lightly but according to dr. Nemeth the teens lungs were stiffened scarred and severely inflamed to a point they'd never seen before in dr. NEMA's own words what I saw in his lungs is like nothing I've seen before and I've been doing lung transplants for 20 years this isn't evil I haven't faced before well that's a terrifying quote but we've still got one last case in store gregory rodriguez 22 was an avid / with a particular liking of THC containing cartridges he'd tried smoking bud previously but his parents could smell it and disapproved vaping was much more discreet then on September 18th 2019 he was admitted to the emergency room at Long Island Jewish Forest Hills Hospital with what he thought was a flu he was feverish nauseous and short of breath throughout the day his condition deteriorated his blood oxygen level was dangerously low and by the afternoon he was on a ventilator by the next day he was in danger of organ failure or heart stoppage four days later he woke up in the Long Island Jewish Medical Center's main campus attached to machines that were pumping air into his blood and removing carbon dioxide Gregory's lungs had shut down and he had nearly lost his life and he wasn't the only one at that hospital according to doctor Mangala Narasimhan a lung specialist at the hospital I think he was our 19th case it's hitting us pretty hard and that's just the ones who are severe enough for us to know about and the scene in his lungs was grisly Gregory's lungs were inflamed with extensive damage to the alveoli a fancy word which here means air sacs according to doctor Narasimha Hahn the stuff coming out of his lungs looked like flan or custard it was so thick there was a lot of inflammatory cells we had to do multiple rounds of washing his lungs out every day after a few days his lungs started to heal and started working again thankfully Gregory's story has a happier ending than others after spending 12 days in the hospital he returned home though he's still on the road to recovery in Gregory's own words when I climb stairs it feels like I'm climbing a mountain when I run a couple steps it feels like I ran a marathon and the culprit well there are a few things that could be causing issues the big concern comes from lung diseases so far linked primarily to third party products containing cannabinoids and illicit brands like dank vapes however at this time the CDC isn't certain exactly what chemicals are at fault and have issued an advisory to cease vaping with any products early concerns focus on oils like vitamin E acetate which could have been used to cut or thicken cannabinoid containing juices for reference cutting a product is mixing other substances into a product to dilute it and increase quantity it's like adding water to your roommates soda to make it seem like you didn't drink any Leif was that these boils were clinging to the inside of lungs clogging them up and filling them with fluids leaving them drowning in their own lungs which is in technical terms bad but recently researchers from the Mayo Clinic examined lung tissue from the victims and found that the issue appeared to resemble chemical burns more than oil what's the culprit behind these well the vitamin E acetate is one of the suspects but there are also health concerns behind some of the flavorings while most of the flavors are considered safe for consumption that label is applied with the assumption that they'll be eaten not inhaled and speaking of taking a wrong puff not having enough ejuice can be a problem too taking a puff when an e-cigarette without juice that's heated up enough or has run too low can cause something called a dry hit dry hits happen when the device is wick isn't heated enough burning the wick and leaving the user with a lung full of unpleasant burnt wick air this is said to leave you with a mouth full of heated cotton flavor and can irritate the throat not the absolute worst but still not pleasant whether it's wicks or oils when they're in a different state applied to a different region of the body things can change news update on November 8th 2019 the CDC announced that vitamin D acetate was one very strong culprit of concern it was also found in all samples taken from those with lung illness and found at the site of whereas other chemicals weren't as present but we only get case by case results and drowning in fluids and chemical burns don't quite align so here's a little hypothesis from me and keep in mind I am NOT a medical expert okay not a doctor over here but is it possible that the oil clinging to the inner tissue of the lungs could carry chemicals with it that in turn burns them we'll have to wait until the results come back but just a thought and to complicate matters further can a safe a testing lab in California that had analyzed 12 samples of black-market vaping products found that all of the products that had inspected contained pesticides and some even had heavy metals like lead but as of my script goblin writing this the exact cause and extent still isn't known and both the CDC and FDA investigations are ongoing though on November 27th 2019 Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker outlawed any flavored tobacco except for products sold in specialty bars for on-site consumption a 75% tax and nicotine limits were also placed on non flavored ecig rets though the nicotine limit only applies to vapes used outside of specialty bars it's also important to note that ecig rets are a relatively new product it took decades or centuries really to learn the devastating health effects of cigarettes and those were marketed as healthy back in the day seriously we really don't know what long-term effects a cigarette can have on people so where does all this leave us well in something of a complicated situation the CDC has advised everyone to stop vaping while it investigates and there's talk about a federal flavored vape juice ban though jewel has already pulled all of its flavors but three from the u.s. menthol Virginia tobacco and classic tobacco some states have gone so far as to ban e-cigarettes entirely and make the sale of vaping products illegal a move that has been met with predictable ire from those who run businesses based on the industry and has seen lawsuits against the states of New York and Massachusetts Jewell has also been accused of shipping out over 1 million contaminated products and is facing not only public scrutiny but also a lawsuit in the same accusation former jewel CEO Kevin Burns was quoted as saying half of our customers are drunk and vaping like mofos who the [ __ ] is going to notice the quality of our pods and here's where I come clean on something we had a miserable time on this topic there were times where the script goblin came to me and said something along the lines of it's getting really hard to stay on biased here so sorry buddy no hard feelings thanks for doing your best while some people might be tempted to make loud opinionated videos oh so you do watch my video they have been known to show up in my out-of-place sometimes yes I'll take what I can get but to end things off make sure you're aware of the risks with anything you put in your body if you're ever unsure what's in anything you're taking look for alternative products or dig a bit deeper and try to find something that actually lists its ingredients so that you can understand what you're consuming always know what kind of habits you're getting into trust me

before following these instructions first empty a 15 milliliter bottle into a larger bottle such as an empty 30 ml unicorn bottle to achieve a 3 milligram concentration empty about one quarter of the Nick shot into the larger bottle to make a six milligram concentration empty about half of the Nick shot and for 12 milligrams empty the entire Nick shot into the bottle in order to achieve your desired Nick strength when mixing your Nick shot into a 30ml bottle of zero milligram ejuice use an even larger empty bottle to mix it in and double the portion of the Nick shot that you add to it then make sure to thoroughly shake the e-liquid mixture it's also recommended that you let it steep for at least a few hours once you've done this you're ready to put the new e-liquid mixture into
