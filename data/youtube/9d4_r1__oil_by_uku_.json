{"ycUIfCMip6A": "I doing guys and welcome back to the channel booboo six one seven ahead so today what we're doing we're gonna change the oil and putting in some frame sliders on a 2009 through 2014 Yamaha r1 alright so first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna take these off with an allen key it's three of these and then in the bottom I'm see if you could see there's some pushpins you just push those I believe there's three of those as well we're gonna take this side fairing out on both sides and start the process [Music] all right so I took this side these are top panels when to push into the inner pushpins I already took the other side out as well you want to take these two out and remember to unplug the light and plug it before you pull this out and now that we have both sides out the next step you want to take the drain plug out what that does is it lets air in while the oil drips out we're done completely both side firings let's stop we have to locate the drain plug which is on the left side of the bike left side meaning if you're on it if you're sitting on the bike is gonna be on your left side on the bottom right there I'm gonna put our oil pan down here so that we could capture the oil you need use number 17 cup socket to take to take the drain plug out yeah you're the color on that bad boy actually not that bad I've seen worse the oil filter out now this was a little tricky because it's kind of in there so I gotta figure out how to take it out that's right before you that don't knows right here alright I was able to take the old order filter out I got the new one here what you want to do is get a little bit of a little bit of dab of oil tip of your finger you're gonna put it around the seal tricks of the trade tricks of the trade I'm gonna pop that boy back in great I'm gonna let the oil drain out well that why that happens I'm gonna start installing the frame sliders I got these I got this pair from ebay I mean pretty affordable pretty affordable pair pretty straightforward they come in pieces so you've gotta put them together I remember when you do these you got to do them one at a time because this goes directly into the motor so one at a time we're gonna do the left side first so we're gonna take this out and start and put this on [Music] now the kit comes with these two boats as you can see the boat that I just took out of here is a lot shorter but that's because it needs to compensate for the thickness of the of the bracket when you're putting these they they go on different sides so you've got to make sure it's the right one so as you can see this one goes here because the boat goes here and then this screw goes there opposed to this one is the opposite I got this I got the Stanley kit for an allen key that helps a lot you're gonna need it [Music] I remember the kick comes with his own old screw for the top too so don't use the original one because the ones that it comes with are a lot longer you've got to figure out which one goes where I'm gonna try the short one first to see if it works I don't take a word I think it would be a long one on the right side we're gonna I mean at this point is trial and error because the kid does not come with instruction this a-frame slider kid does not come with instructions [Music] all right now we're on the left side same thing is gonna be a 17-month let me take this little screw from the top out and remember we're not gonna use this one anymore don't use the one that comes with the kit the kit provides the washer put that washer in this is how it's gonna go first hand tighten it a little bit and then we're gonna put this screw like the kick comes with the kick comes with a thicker to plugging back the oil is a sinister finishing the oil change I gonna plug our drain plug back in and make sure you wipe the headers down and the down pipe because it's gonna smoke he's gonna smoke a little bit regardless because they did get oil on it but you know clean it out as much as you can right now it's time to put in the oil what I'm gonna do I'm gonna use this photo here I'm gonna put three and a half quarts and then I'm a love of the bike out I'm gonna look down here into the little oil window and if there's levels we're good if not I'll put a little bit more [Music] all right so we got a nice and tight we got the air the oil filter on we got the oil wind we got the drain plug plugged up we still got the fans off we're gonna start it now I'm gonna start it just to make sure everything is good in it's not leaking now next up is a double check that is it is not leaking so we checked the filter the oil filter make sure you can leave the dough oil right on top you have noticed a leak or a drop on on the oil itself looks good so far so next step is to put the fairings on and we're done [Music] all right and that's it everything's good to go got these in what I do recommend the did not bring instructions so it's a little trial and error so don't even put these on until you put the fairings after you put the ferry thing you're gonna do a trial and error to see what side fits what for the cuts here that's my recommendation and that's conclusive that is slaying of frames I can't even talk frame sliders and oil change are one Yamaha r1 from 2009 to 2014", "CDGbiNlG868": "[Music] how's it going guys today we're going to be taking a look at how to do an oil change on a 2015 and up r1 if you have any questions or there's anything i didn't cover in the video drop it in the comments and i'd be glad to help you guys out you'll enjoy on this bike the oil filter will be on the left side underneath the fairing you won't have to remove this fairing but you will have to loosen it in order to gain access to the filter and the drain plug is going to be on the very bottom of the oil pan underneath the bike to get started you're going to need to remove these push pins i usually just use either a smaller t-handle or a pick to get them out be sure to keep your hardware organized as you work there's many ways to do this but i prefer to use a paper plate with labels on it so that i know where everything came from and it doesn't get separated next you're gonna need to remove these three bolts on the fairing which are gonna be a metric four as well as the two on this plate which are gonna be metric five once you've removed all of those this panel should come out and you should be able to move the fairing which should give you enough space to get that filter out now to remove the oil the drain plug is going to be on the bottom of the oil pan between the y-pipe it's going to be a metric six allen key to remove it i like to use a roger for this i'll crack the plug loose and then slide the oil pin under and fully remove the plug to let it drip i always like to clean the drain plug while i have it off be sure to replace the crush washer and reinstall the plug before you begin filling oil you can use a pair of channel locks to crack the filter loose and then screw it off by hand there are dedicated tools for this if it's being extra stubborn and some filters like the k n come with a nut welded onto the end to make it easier to remove you can just use a socket for those i usually have a little piece of plastic i use to funnel the oil straight into the drain pan if you get any oil on the exhaust no matter how hard you try to clean it up it's probably gonna smoke a little bit when you first start up the bike that isn't bad it's just the oil burning off the exhaust this time we're using a high flow filtral filter they do come pre-lubed with a little bit of shrink wrap on there but i still like to put a little bit of new oil on there just to help the seal before installing the new filter i also always like to clean the mating surface and when you install it you'll screw it on by hand and you only want it to be hand tied otherwise you can damage the seal this is the oil set glass you're going to want to make sure that after you're done filling it with the bike held level either on a stand or held up by a friend that the oil falls between these minimum maximum lines here i'm using a full synthetic 10 weight 40 oil the manual recommends full synthetic either 10 weight 40 or 15 weight 50. this bike will take 4.3 quarts of oil once you've poured in 4.3 quarts make sure to replace the fill cap and then start the bike for a few minutes to allow the soil to circulate kill the bike and let it sit for another few and then with the bike held level either on a stand or just being held up check the oil level in the side glass and make sure it's between the lines once you have the oil to the correct level you can begin to put the bike back together you're going to want to make sure you use up all the hardware and also everything should go back together smoothly so if you find yourself having to force something stop and look at it again the removed push pin should look like this the center will be depressed in order to be able to reinstall it you're just going to need to push this part through and then you'll insert that into the slot and once it's in place you push it like that and that causes these little prongs to expand and that's how it holds it in place and once you get everything reinstalled you're ready to go i like to keep an eye on that sight glass checking for both level and color of the oil and i recommend changing the oil around every 3000 miles thank you guys for watching if you have any extra questions you can drop them down in the comments and i'd be glad to help you out if you did find this helpful i'd appreciate it if you give me a like and subscribe for more content every week until next time guys peace out [Music] you", "mOVcw95wnTU": "all right guys so first service today i did this myself this is the first time i've ever done anything like this on a bike um i did my homework uh i looked through the owner's manual definitely looked through owner's manual it tells you everything you need to check for your 600 mile service you can register with i think it's called yamaha advantage something like that yamalube advantage online and then you can keep your warranty even though you're doing your own oil change but you need to show them your receipt and and you also need to show them um what you bought as far as oil oil filter and they asked for the part numbers and all this stuff too don't forget to also purchase this part this is this was the drain bolt um washer you're gonna need that it's a plastic one they are not reusable so they told me to get uh well i got five quarts you're only supposed to use four to four point two quarts when you change the filter so the oil filter process change is pretty damn easy guys i would just do this yourself all you really need is that okay first thing you'll do slide down underneath there here's your drain bolt simple allen head drain it okay you'll take off these two allen bolts this bolt this bolt and that's it guys that will give you enough room to have this um fairing totally loose so you can get your oil filters right in here my engraved the mileage and the date and my initials on the oil filter i don't know if you guys can see it you don't have to do that but i like to do that just for whoever sees it next so that's where you um get that's where your oil filter is i definitely suggest you buy the oil filter tool the specialty tool this is the yamaha oem piece that makes it really easy to get the filter off okay so after you replaced the after you drained all your oil out you replaced the piece that little uh sorry my mine's blank that little washer that goes with it the drain washer okay put that back in tighten it to spec i believe it was 17 foot pounds check your owner's manual to be sure okay and then you will reach in here put your your kit um put this right on the end of there loosen that easily comes off and you get tons of room once you get those four off you don't need to take off the whole fairing and risk scratching it okay make sure that you get your make sure the the o-ring is off of the oil filter it's not left on the engine okay then put the new one on torque it to spec i believe that was 13 foot pounds if i recall again check your owner's manual it will tell you right in there section eight page five i believe okay get that tightened come over here uh and then you'll put after you get the filter tightened then you'll put those fairings back on real quick this is where you fill it make sure that your fill tool is completely clean of any debris very very clean okay use this oil 15w50 fully synthetic put four quarts in and then check through the after you're all done with it here's where you check your level looks great and remember i'm up on a jack right now so you'll want to check it when it's down on the flat ground you could probably do this without the jack just makes it a little bit easier to do it that way okay so after we got the oil changed that was that i also pulled off these two stickers just because i think they're ugly this was on the back this was right in the tank just heat those up with a blow dryer you can use goo gone to get rid of the sticker residue but that didn't work very well i highly suggest using acetone it came right off instantly with that um make sure that after you use the acetone that you this is just water in here soapy water so clean off the acetone even though it evaporates immediately i still like to um clean it off just with water just to make sure that your paint's not going to be in risk so i'm going to install this after the video is done okay so what else did i do for the first 600 mile checkup so check your clutch fluid make sure that it is right the right dose dose these are you're supposed to check your levers and their play and everything but these are already aftermarket and i know that they're good um you can lube the cable if you need to okay you want to be checking for any abnormal uh things going on right here um which you should be able to feel um when you're driving it you'll be it'll be feel kind of clunky or loose or like something's not right here okay and this is in the owner's manual right here guys okay so that's kind of what so eight three is where it starts all right so that this is the this is where you look at 600 mile don't need to do spark plugs fuel injection don't need to do anything with that so eight five right here so there's no check engine light issues we don't need to worry about that clutch weird you know the operation is good something would be wrong something's wrong you'd know it front brake check your brakes front and rear brakes just kind of look in there and make sure that you don't see any abnormal scratching um you can get it's hard for me to get the camera in there but you can see that the brakes the brake pads look fine look normal check the front check the back i've already done this so i'm not going to do it but anyways so check the brakes make sure that those are good there's no funky stuff going with the brakes that's it for that page steering bearings i just showed you guys that okay side stance switch so what this is is that make sure that when your bike is running that when you throw your side side stance switch when you put your kickstand down your bike should automatically turn off and mine definitely does that i did that the other day so check that make sure that's working properly change your engine oil we've done that engine oil filter so it looks like next time we don't have to do the oil filter on the 4 000 mile change x-up system that's just the exhaust system which my exhaust is custom not worrying about that front and rear brake switches we just talked about that control cables you can lube those if you want to get some yamaha lube um and check all your turn signals i've already done that so check your high beams your brakes your turn signals now also it doesn't listen there but check your tire pressure so my rear tire was down to 26 um psi and from what i've read people recommend running them at 36 psi front and rear however as you can read here it says to do 42 in the rear 36 in the front but i'm going to run 36 front and back do your own research but definitely check on that okay because it was way low and i've been doing some canyon riding okay so the next thing you'll want to do so i also bought this uh chain care kit which is nice it comes with a scrubber to get all the nasty stuff off i highly suggest cleaning your chain and then re-lubing it which is what i've done you can hear how smooth that is now okay so you'll clean it first then you can wipe it off with your dirty rags or whatever and then re-lube it okay now you want to you want to get one of these tools if you can this hopefully you guys know how to use this this checks to measure the millimeters you need to check your chain's free play with you need to measure how much from the top to the bottom how much free play is on that chain you need to be between 25 millimeters and 35 millimeters um also from the research i've done a lot of people recommend they like to run it at 35 millimeters so at the end of that so you just go like this um i can't do it i'm only using one hand but you'll move the chain up and down and measure how much free play there is okay and we are right at the limit so we're at 35 we're gonna leave it there for now but i'm going to keep a close eye on it i'll probably need to tighten this chain probably at about a thousand miles is what i'm going to do it but i'm just definitely going to keep a close eye on it i don't want it to be any looser than this but that's where we're going to keep it so if it wasn't even to be tight you'd loosen and adjust right here on this side and you do the same thing this side you'd loosen this nut and you need to also use that measurement tool to measure the gap between here and here to make sure that you're pretty pretty much that your rear alignment is on because that if it's the gap's bigger on this side and smaller on that side your tracks going to be off and you're going to be risking wrecking probably will wear your tire out quick too so make sure that you measure that and make sure that uh the gap is exactly the same on both sides okay look how dirty this thing is i don't want to touch that because it's gonna it'll scrape the wheels so we're gonna we're gonna go detail this bike as soon as we get done with this video so yeah guys we're just over 600 miles now you can see i've got quite a few mods done to the bike i'm loving this thing and i'm really excited so i should be ordering the tinted screen soon that's probably my next mod and then trying to decide if i'm going to paint the back parts blue or leave them and then i'm trying to find out if i'm going to leave that gray sticker on so as you guys know that i hate all the gray that came stock on the 2020s i'm not going to go into that all right now but just want to show you guys my bike and where i'm at with it i am absolutely loving this thing guys so i hope you guys are all riding safe hopefully i didn't forget anything in this video uh but yeah this will save you a ton of money if you do this yourself plus you know you know how to work on your own bike um if i was gonna take it to have a service i would have had to pre-plan a weekend ahead and then drop it off and it's like an hour away i just saved myself all this money with the extra money that i saved i bought a stand in the rear spools these were cheap and now i have the oil tool kit for next time it's just nice to be able to work on your own stuff and know what's going on now i don't recommend doing this if you're like basic rookie ass you never worked on a car before i probably wouldn't do it then but if you know basic stuff you know how to use a torque wrench um and you have a torque wrench or you can borrow one then i would definitely suggest doing it yourself and then just go over and make sure you use brake parts cleaner spray it all over this stuff because all the oil is drained on your exhaust you can burn it off if you want but i would recommend trying to wipe it all off before you start it and that should be good guys", "MRBJjnsZZ-0": "[Music] well hello everybody and welcome to this week's biking buddies a five minute Friday if you're new to this channel then please hit that subscribe button down below don't forget to click on the Bell notification to be notified every time I make an upload so what are we up to today on this week's five minute Friday or grab yourself a brew strap yourself in and let me take you deep into this week's five minute Friday okay then so the weather is not too clever at the moment and what better opportunity and better time to catch up on a little bit of much-needed maintenance on the bike so to answer the initial question what are we up to in this week's by five minute Friday well we're gonna do a quick oil change on the bike so genuine mortal oil as per the Yamaha spec and also a genuine Yamaha oil field so the first thing that we need to do is run the bike up and put a little bit of heat into the engine not too hot the reason that we do that it just makes the oil a little bit more viscous and a little bit more easy to get it out of the engine so I've already done that and the next job that I need to do is I've got to remove the belly pan off the bike to expose the oil filter down here so I'll get cracking and get stuck into that [Music] okay then folks so just as simple as that belly pan off that exposes the bits that we need so the next item to take off is the oil filter and that's just located down in here and then I've also got to get the sump not out here and let the oil drip into the oil drip tray so sit yourself back while I set myself to work okay so now that's the oil out for the next step is just to clean up the area that we're working with and this is where good old GT 85 comes in so just a liberal squirt around where the oil filter is going to mount into it I think it's really important that you give this a good plain because again all of the surrounding area where you have a little bit of oil that is weeped out during that filter change you don't need to clean that up so that you know what is all dial and what's potentially new oil if you haven't managed to get a good seal when you get this back together so that's all nice and clean now now here's a handy little tip for you if you get your new oil filter and hopefully this still will be on shot peel off the protective plastic coating on your filter now there will be a little bit of Lube here around the sale but personally what I like to do is I like to take the cap off the new oil just put a little smear on your finger of brand new oil and then with your new oil filter just cause that rubber seal with the new oil and what that does is as you put your new oil filter on and then you tighten it up against the mating face of the engine it just prevents the rubber seal from snagging and poly now these only ever need to be hun tight you shouldn't really need to tool them on there's a little bit awkward on this bike to actually get in so hand tight and there's our oil filter all done okay so other things that you should be doing whilst we just get in the last a few dregs of oil out of the engine is we have our sump bolt here with our compression brass what you know it's very important that every time you do an oil change this little brass washer is exchanged I don't know how clearly be able to see there but you can see that there are some compression marks on there against the brand new one which is the one underneath and if you turn them sideways you will see how much the top washer has been squashed or that one's destined for the bin and we make sure that we put a brand new compression brass washer onto our sump note so I'm just going to let these dregs drip out for a few more minutes and then we'll get the sump plug back in [Music] when you're putting something in because you don't want to cross thread when you tighten this off that's finger tight take our socket set and we literally just want to give this a nip and a pull very very tempting to over tighten things like this but you have got to remember you put in hardened steel into an aluminium sump so we're ready to go on out put some oil in the bike so jump around the other side and we'll put some fluids back in this based [Music] okay folks so there you have it all done and dusted all I need to do now one very important thing is I do need to fire the back up I need to check for oil leaks around that sump plug and also with the oil filter once I've done that I'll run the back for about a minute or two and then I'll shut the back down let everything settle the oil should be nice and warm by then and the final check is the sight glass for the oil levels because at the moment we're about where we need to be of course the marks as per the factory recommendation however the oil filter itself is empty now I know it's only a very small volume but these bags are quite sensitive this one just taking 3.3 liters of oil so I do need to make sure that I'm on the max so that's about all I've got time for with this five minute Friday squeezed everything in so as I said at the beginning if you're new to the channel and you haven't done so already please hit the subscribe button click on that Bell notification and whatever you are wherever you are in the world whatever you doing keep it safe give its shiny side up and we will catch you for the next one thank you guys thank you bye [Music]", "zif2LTh-tOk": "[Music] what's going on youtube today i'm going to show you how to change your own motorcycle oil that's quite easy and i'm going to show you how to do it so first of all for this one you need to ln screw and you got three bolts on the right side and three on the left as you can see in this procedure once you take this off put them aside please so you know exactly what how to put them back because once you begin with the procedure and sometimes they the stuff get can get messy and it's easy to lose some boots and if you put them back again you don't know why they where they belong to so for this one before you even start the procedure warm up your motorcycle just a little bit not too much just a little bit so your engine is getting a little bit warmer and it's going to be easy for you to uh pour out the oil from the engine of the bike so for this one you need the socket 17. and this is by the way for only four for the yamaha ones from i guess 2009 till 14. so i'm really careful with this one as you can see i don't want to drop my bolt in the bucket because it's going to be really messy stuff see only the pros can do that as i mentioned before in the beginning you warm up your motorcycle just for this reason look how easy the oil is coming off of the engine and it makes it really easy and things going to love a lot of faster so for this one you need a new oil filter and make sure you and go with the oil around the gasket install your oil filter in there and make sure you use the aluminium foil for your exhaust pipes because you don't want to get this freaking oil on your exhaust pipes so tight up this one back again it's really important before you even pour in the new oil inside your engine and make sure you tie this up but please don't go any rambo or dwayne johnson with it the amount of this oil is 3.9 liters so please make sure you pour only 3.9 and don't go beyond that and if you found this video helpful make sure you leave a like and i'll see you by the next one goodbye", "7gOwQ3B8O_I": "hey what is that my friends welcome once again to the video today I would be teaching you how to do an oil change on a 2009 to 2014 Yamaha r1 very simple steps guys nothing to it we're in the middle of the summer right now guys so I live in El Paso Texas it gets pretty hot here so we'll be using the full synthetic oil the 15 W 50 this is always really good for the summertime this is what they recommended me to get so is what I'm getting you can get the cheap ones like a semi semi synthetic but I recommend you get a full synthetic during the summer this will help your engine a lot step number one is turn on your bike lady heat up a little bit I would say let the temperature go to 200 Fahrenheit after that turn off your bike and then you can start at the wrist step number two you're gonna come to the left side of your bike down below buy that below fairing you're gonna take out one two three four and five bolts that way you can get to your drain bolt of the and the bottom the oil drain bolt you might want to twist your wheel a little bit that we have more room to to play if you want to you can remove the fairings guys this right here and then the left and the right fairings but I'm gonna try to do this the minimal time-consuming as possible I'm gonna try to do it just like that because the the drain bolt is right here like I said and then the oil filter it'll be right in the middle right here let me show you where it's at it'll be right there you guys can see it right in the middle right there I don't you can see where I'm pointing my finger right there so you don't really have to take out the left and the right faring that's only if you want to but let's see if it works out like that step number three you come to the right side of your bike I'm gonna screw the top where the oil goes in through that we can get air and that way there's no pressure holding it step number four you come again to the left side of your bike locate the oil drain bolt you're gonna put this on the bottom that way though the oiler can stay there you're gonna be using a 17 millimeter socket all righty step number five again you're gonna have to remove the oil filter it'll be right in the middle the headers right here guys like I said you can remove your fairings the left and the right if it's it's really up to you I'm not gonna do it because I think you can go through here you have a good reach amount to go in there so this is what you will need an oil filter F cap wrench that way ego you can put it in there and that way you can you know twist it pretty good with this one it's a special one for motorcycles it's a sixty five to seven millimeters so that's what you need 65 dashes to seven millimeters all right careful because this might be hot so be careful you're putting it this in because remember you be that your bike run a little bit so it's gonna be a little bit hot I'm not too sure and you find out I'm gonna stop that hot all right as you can see there you go there's my I hope these things will been pretty good in there if not I can there you go you want to get an extended about this long that we have a reach in there you know that we have to be like struggling make sure you have your pan in the bottom still right there because oil will fall off after you unscrew a little bit you can do with your hand now okay so I managed to take out the filter but you see I didn't think about this first you will have to remove your right side fairing because how you gonna take out your filter it's gonna have to be through that side let me show you how step number six after you remove the oil filter from the bottom of the headers you come to the right side of your bike like I said I thought you weren't gonna have to remove the fairing but obviously you do now I see why again this is the first time I ever do this so bear with me you remove one two and three bolts right here that way this can come off now you can see you have enough room to remove your oil filter through here it's kind of tricky but you'll manage to get it out just like that you see in step number seven you get your new oil filter I got the Yamaha because they didn't have K&N but I was trying to look for Kanan but oh well Yamahas a pretty good brand too as well show it to you see nice very nice he removed his little plastic in the bottom like that guys make sure when you put this back inside there you put oil around it through here little bit of oil just enough you can get it from the pan just that just the tip of your finger go like that around it just like so I dipped it in there I'm gonna do is this all around just like that little bit not too much step number eight you go ahead and put it back in through here through what you got it from go ahead and put it back in through here leave it in the middle and if you can if you can go ahead and put it back in there if not you can go to the left side of your bike and you can check it out to see how it's going in you can see it right here I got to do is tighten it up once it's in there once you tighten it up with your hand step number nine go ahead and get your cap wrench again put it in there go ahead and get your extender and tighten it up not too tight remember you want to show love to your machine you don't want to do this too tight just a number ten after you put the oil filter back in the front you're gonna be in the left side of your bike you're gonna grab your drain bolt put it back in there you want to make sure it's a little bit lubricated so dip it in the oil it doesn't matter as long as it lubricate it and put it back in there step number 12 you're gonna use a total of four quarts this bike takes 3.8 liters so that equals the amount of four quarts all right you get a funnel like so and you get your oil and start putting it in the engine [Applause] step number thirteen after you finish putting all your oil your four quarts into the tank go ahead and close it up with your top don't forget of course and guys you want to check this out right underneath here you might wonder what that is it tells you the oil level if you're set up your bike straight I know most of you don't have stands like I do so are you gonna do is put your bike kind of straight like that and your oil level should be in between those two lines right there that means it's perfect mine's perfect right there in between those two lines on you guys can see it but that means your oil level is on point step number fourteen before you put all your fittings on turn on your bike let it get hot again to 2000 Fahrenheit check get on your left and you're riding your front checkerboard for leakage if you're good you can go ahead and put your things back on this is not a stamp this is just the tip go ahead and get a rubber stuck for your shifter guys that weight shift pretty smooth and you never give you shoes dirty look at them Jordan them they're already my friend so you're done it's time to hit the road have to be careful it's trying to be safe out there again did you enjoy these videos please give it a big thumbs up more videos to come and again and you guys watching and I'll see you in the next time too [Music]", "VfyuHVxVsX0": "real quick all right Bushman he's you're all family if you're doing your filter you're gonna need a filter obviously in some of these I'll show you why you're gonna need this sighs one of these the allen key and then you're gonna need a 17 millimeter socket ratchet I think I think it's 17 millimeter you're going to need four quarts of this don't use anything else unless you're in like a specific temperate zone for temperatures and but this is pretty much good everywhere and in some napkins in a funnel and maybe some extra alright let's get right into it real quick you're gonna go down here and this one right here just going to pop that to the last nut this one and that one and over here you got one right here this one's a little bit more of a doozy because it's an actual and that's out there then you got this another one one right here this is actually the longest one right here alright and then you got one underneath here don't forget about that one just do that one the same as all the others you're gonna pull this back little that pops down and then there's one up here that cool color that pops down in you're free take your fairing off don't lose your screws okay and then we're gonna go get rid of that allen key go right down here you don't even need a stand for this to do this oil change to which is good and so here's your oil filter right here if you need to take off your oil filter I suggest not trying to twist it just stab a hole through it with a long Phillips head and then turn it and that's going to loosen it and then uh make it will everywhere yeah you'll get a will everywhere fun that's what I had left him because it was too tight so I did myself - already so we're not doing a filter today but it screws off this way anyway we're going to go right here to this screw on the bottom of the uh I guess it's the oil reservoir and we're gonna go yep this so it is a 17 millimeter alright it's gonna do this by hand real quick all right so it's just doing this last couple drips here we're going to go around to the other side to where you actually pour the oil in right here and what I'm gonna just felt the pressure and I could hear it actually relieve so it's relieve some pressure in there and that's the rest of the whoo yeah this is where it should be a little bit dripping still down there yeah and one thing about this guys is you have a lock to your gas tank obviously you don't have a lot to your will so what I'm going to do next time is actually once my little change is all good to go I'm going to wrap some flat black piece of duct tape right around the oil cap right there like a nice sized piece just to ensure that I know for my safety no one's with the oil nope all right guys so it's still dripping a little but that doesn't really matter because there's still it so no oil in the filter okay so we're just gonna put it back in now and keep moving well put it back on in there have a look at that yeah so it's already tight and I'm gonna hold on to my freaking up little guy here and just get it and he's done okay so I'm gonna put - so we're out here Guam and I put in on 20 W 50 in and actually started up the r1 so I'm putting in I'm putting back in what it's always been running this has always been running 10 w 40 and that was in on North Carolina so you have the high mountains with those zones and then you got the cold so 10 w 40 is what these bikes like especially llaman lube I know it's just a name-brand don't believe it but you should believe it because I put in this 20 W 50 from Napa and it the bike up that's why I'm doing so well change right now yeah you changed their filter and I take a filter out just a couple weeks he goes alright so there's there's two point two point eight or time right there and okay make sure this cabin getting shots kind of did that's clean and now you want to let it run for a couple minutes all you got are two point eight or nine you didn't put that last that point - or even some more of the fourth take it up to three point one or two depending on the bike if there's already oil in your filter or not is what's going to make that change so since there's already some leftover oil in my [Music] hey guess what guys I ran in for a second shift in the gears to a sketchy [Music] there we go so that makes me happy because the chickens might be low and I need know what I was going to do [Music] baby girl get this one 10:40 no matter where dad coldly yeah stay with to show you how to check your oil now in the site boss is probably not going to show anything [Music] funny [Music] and it might fill up slowly she soon so that now I have the bike position straight up so you're gonna need a friend for this part so what's it what's it showing on that second all right so we're probably 3.0 three chords total and then if I did put too much fellas you just lead it out it's not easy alright put in uh dad punch it up who actually saw a little bugger some a little piece of black go in there so I think that'll be fine you just got a deal always wear your helmet [Music] or hat if you got one just kidding [Music] taken around the park let's have a look at the oil all right those oil games yeah you covering it you're like I got it straight up right she's Tony's for us Pittman art worked warehouse yeah we're happy top half help all right it raised a little bit I think all right so we're gonna end this video here the oil raise to half but it'll take time to trim some come out later obviously going back [Music]", "97Bfde9fmG0": "what's up guys so today I'm going to be doing the 600-mile service on my 2016 Yamaha r1 so real quick things you're going to need you're going to need five quarts of oil this eases I believe four point three three quarts yeah four point three three quarts so you need five quarts I'm going with synthetic some of you guys are probably saying now don't do that for your first oil change and if you look the manual it specifically says recommended engine oil full synthetic 10w forty it doesn't say anything about break in oil or not to use that on the first change so that's what I'm going to do then of course you're going to need your oil filter so you guys should be able to read that so you're going to need your oil filter five quarts of oil you need a couple of oil filter wrenches cut a couple options there some allen keys and Torx bits probably mechanics tool set and oil drain pan funnel and of course paper towels and gloves if you have a lift it's awesome and this is like you know an amazing way to do this but you don't need it you do kind of need a rear stand although you could probably figure out a way to do this without even that let me grab a ladder here and I'll climb up there and show you how many miles the bike has on it let's say so you should be able to see that it has 532 miles five hundred thirty two point six miles on it right now so doing it a little early but there's nothing really wrong with that and in fact that's what the dealer recommended to me all right first thing you're going to want to go ahead and take out these three actually precise four little quarter turn bolts basically just turn a little bit and they pop out you're also going to want to take out these three plastic clips basically what you do take something small and pointy poke it in the middle and then the whole thing on the split you can use your fingernails to to pull it out so basically what these knees came from under here there's three little holes one two and three three holes over there and then there's a bolt here bolt here a bolt back here a bolt down here now we should be able to carefully remove our fairing all right so I want to end got the fourth push pin out so there's one right here one right here one right here and one right here along with excuse me along with your four bolts so take those off and then you kind of just pull forward on it a little bit and it pops right off so I'm going to go ahead and set this off to the side definitely put this somewhere safe because you don't want to scratch it all right so I put the fairing somewhere safe can you go ahead and get the manual out of the way so we don't get oil all over it alright so next we need to take off this heat shield right here so these two bolts so we can get to the oil filter so you want to take your large allen wrench and go ahead and crack those loose they're on there pretty snug all right and there's two so we're going to go ahead and set this off to the side - all right so next thing first of all the engine is already warm because I wrote it a little bit before I put it up here so next thing is to go ahead and remove the oil drain plug so we're going to go ahead and move everything out of the way and I'll get set up to do that all right so go ahead and put our catch pan underneath I kind of want to put it all the way under so then I can take the drain bolt out or loosen the drain bolt and then I'll pull it in and take the rest out with my hand all right so I'm going to go ahead and get the drain bolt loosened up a little bit let's go ahead and crack that loose should be able to take it out the rest away with my fingers all right so I got it loosened as far as I can without losing any oil so now let's see that was messy but that's draining all right now this is where you need the paper towel so I'll be right back all right so the next thing we need to do is get the oil filter off so I've seen some people say is like tin foil or something I personally just like to get a couple of nice heavy-duty paper towels like this I think these are like Scott's garage towels whatever so just go ahead and take these and stick it over the exhaust here like so and then we're going to get our filter wrench so I like to use this one normally but that is not going to clear so we're going to use the big plier looking thing here to carefully grab this and give her a little turn all right get this loosened up a little bit from the factory these things are on there really tight so usually gotta come Adam a couple different ways before we get them off make sure our paper channel is up in there go ahead and get this off make sure drain pans underneath because this will make a mess see this works just fine sure it's going to soak through a little bit but it'll be okay now it's basically stopped dripping there's a couple trips coming either still but we're good to go ahead and put our oil filter on so go ahead and get this out of the box and take the plastic off all right now I'm going to go ahead and open up one of these and we'll go ahead and pour a little bit in there not too much just a little bit and we'll get some of that and put it on gasket here and we'll go ahead and screw our oil filter on go ahead and get that bad boy on there I'll slip right now skip that on there nice and tight and go ahead and clean up any of our excess and I'm gonna go ahead and clean up the exhaust a little bit and I'll be right back alright so now I'm going to go and put the drain plug back in got a new washer on there so I'll just want to kind of wipe it clean up in there first and then go ahead and get our drain bolt back in alright so I went ahead and got everything kind of cleaned up here just use some quick detailer and paper towels because that's what I had laying around here and so now the manual says to torque the drain bolt down to 17 foot pounds so I'm going to go ahead and do that go ahead and get this guy set to 17 all right so now we're going to go ahead and torque this guy down all right so that's 17 foot-pounds now I'm going to go ahead and go to the other side and get ready to put the new oil in all right so the manual calls for four point three three quarts so we're going to go ahead and put four in all the bikes up here and then we'll put it on the ground take it off the rear stand and get it perfect so let's go ahead and put our fall in there and start pouring pressure to open all four of them before I start porn so now I don't have enough hands there's two and here's three and there's four so we'll add the 0.33 in after we get it leveled off and that way we don't overfill it because if you check the oil with it up on the rear stand you get a weird reading so alright so now we're going to go ahead and start putting our bearings back on first you want to go and put this metal piece back on here I went ahead and cleaned up everything real nice here so we want to get our two bolts alright got our heat shield back on go ahead and just wipe this down a little paper towel get our Whateley fingerprints and stuff off here this does move there's a like rubber like washer in here that allows it to kind of flex a little bit alright now to put this on the first thing you want to do is go ahead and put the tabs here and here and here into their proper spots up here and slide it into place once you get into place it'll just go just like that and pop on real nice so now go ahead and get the tabs lined up down here these there's these two little tabs on that heat shield that go into these little notches here so just go ahead and push those in next we're going to go ahead and start putting this back on so to do that basically you're just going to kind of pull it and kind of click it around that edge just like that you'll know when you have it it just kind of pops into place real nice I haven't got a couple of bolts in so the way these things work is basically you just take this and you push it back out like this until it pokes out and then you just kind of reach under here and you feel the hole and wiggle it in and just push on that little middle part and it snaps right into place real nice so we'll go ahead and do that again let's push it out feel the hole and click it into place and you'll know if you got it into place or not because if you don't have it in just right it'll just fall out alright so now I'm going to go ahead and get the last few fairing bolts in here so it's going to be this one and this one and this one down here and then I'll be right back well you don't here let me go ahead and show you guys how these go in basically a little notch in there all you have to do is take it and drop it in the hole and spin it a little bit and it clicks you hear a little click and it's in so I'm going to go and do the same on the other so then I'm going to kind of wipe it all down and then we'll go ahead and top off the oil", "uwO2DISVIw8": "what is going on YouTube welcome back to the channel and welcome to an r1 oil change tutorial video yesterday we swapped out of those clutch plates or that one clutch plate and I told you guys I was gonna make a tutorial in case anyone needed help with changing the way elements bike so that is exactly what I'm gonna do today let's jump right into it now before changing your oil and anything it's always a good idea to have your engine warm the oil warm so go ahead ride the bike a little bit I can't write it as you can see it's pretty there's a lot of snow outside & dicie's off the bike right now getting reflashed already tuned so I'm gonna be draining the oil on this like cold but it's gonna come out a lot faster if the oil is warm so go ahead ride the back a little bit if you can the only tools you will need to complete this job is a ratchet with a extension that's not necessary but I like to have an extension with a four millimeter allen head if you have that just use a four millimeter allen wrench that is the 70 millimeter wrench poured the drain plug and then an oil filter wrench in case your filter is stuck on there so the first thing we need to do is remove this left bearing you can either remove the completely faring or just the lower part I always opt in for just remove the whole left bearing so there's a three bolt up here there's three Clips under there and then you clip back there and then some sort of it'll rub a clip there so go ahead get all this removed in this very little pop off now that we have the engine cover off we can have access to the drain plug which is right there so grab your 17 millimeter wrench and loosen that up now we're also gonna need to remove the oil filter it is right there right up in there so I'm gonna go ahead and remove the right side panel as well we'll make life a lot easier this is the same exact process as the left side so now we have the fairy Norfolk no head reach your hand back here this is definitely a pain to get to and loosen up that oil filter being that I do have the grave system on here I'm gonna go ahead pull off that bit pipe not necessary if you have the OEM exhaust you should really reach back there and remove that filter just fine so now you have access to the oil filter we can go ahead and remove it you might need oil filter wrench for this might not make sure you have your oil pan underneath already we can throw the drain plug back to on to the motor throw it up on there and we're gonna snug that up using our 70 millimeter wrench nothing can crazy snug it up just enough to crush that washer the ceiling washer now from here it is time to install the oil filter back on to the motor so I have a knife a gold filter right here but personally I would highly recommend the Canaan filter because they have a little nut on the end of it they're still easily get off I just happened to run out of them so I had to run to the local napa pick up this filter but i'll have both these link down below if you want the goal to go with the gold it's a really good filter Kade ends better because that's the nut on the end but I'll have both this gold filter the Napa gold and the KNN linked down below so what I like to do before I put the filter onto the motor just grab a tiny touch oil and rub it on the seal this will help the filter steel better and when you got to remove it next time it'll come off easier the seal will not get stuck to the crankcase up in there get it threaded on or some kind tightening this down my hand there's no need to crank it down with the filter red-room [Applause] from here we're gonna throw the backpack together so I'm gonna throw my exhaust back on there are both side fans on and then we can do the fun part add the oil the very last thing we need to do to finish this oil changes add the oil this here is the oil I'm using it's the EMS oil 10 w 40 I'll have a link down in the description box below it is quite a bit more expensive than other oils on the market but I'm a firm believer and treating your bikes right in they'll treat you right so make sure you go pick some of this up very high quality stuff you owe me for course or I just picked up a gallon myself so as you can see I have the bike up on the stand just that's level plot the dipstick and insert my phone bike has to be level when you're doing this guys 100% necessary just buy cakes 30 point 8 quarts total to fill it up we're gonna add oil and tell us about halfway through the side glass right here [Music] so that looks pretty good there so what you don't wanna do from here is actually run the engine being that I have the EC off the bike getting me flashed I cannot do that we go ahead and run the engine for about five minutes and then recheck the oil level guys if you don't have stands they can feel this on the ground but you got to tip the bike up so it is hundred percent level that is gonna wrap up this video guys if you enjoyed it you know the drill hit that thumbs up button down below like I mentioned earlier I'm gonna have the oil and those two filters down in the description box below really hope this helped you out and as always if you have any questions just drop them down in the comments thank you for watching and I'll see you in the next video and for everyone wondering about the FRS build guys I have not forgot about that car I just really wanted to get this AR one completely completely done before I get started Mia for us again so the very next video coming out should be the FRS build again stay tuned for that", "-rMXqUDAwvc": "good morning YouTube welcome back to the garage today Mayra is getting her first home oil change so we're using for the oil change obviously oil pan got a small screwdriver for pushing out the pushpins a little hook to pull them out go to for a five and a six millimeter some foil August the filter and five quarts of llamo Lube 10 w 40 stay tuned alright everybody so first things first locate everything we need so we've got one two three and four those are four millimeters that have to come off to fold this section off but you also have one two three I thought there was four but not yep four right in there for pushpins four four millimeters pull this side panel off once that's off we can get to the oil filter alright some that we've designated everything that needs to come off what we're going to go ahead and do is start the bike up for a second to get the oil my son a little warm that way it flows a little freer all right everybody now that she's all warmed up I'm gonna go ahead and do we're gonna take our six millimeter and loosen the drain plug kinda hard to do one-handed so what I'll do is I'll go ahead and loosen it start it draining and I'll be back with you when it's draining standby all right we got it all loosened up now get it out of there bingo oh sorry for the finger in the camera all right she's German we'll get everything wiped off and be back with you in a second all right everybody you can see she's draining pretty good so now what we're gonna do while she finishes we're going to go ahead and get to taking these fairings off well fairings I mean Ferenc just the one and we'll hit the one two three four up there and the floor push pins up front I'll have my assistant hold the camera while I do it remember these are Auto capture so they don't come out all the way so for that one apparently make me look a fool so there's those four just grandly take them up all right now for the push pins up throats we want to turn the bars slightly give a better angle on them you can come around this other side if you want it's going to be hard to see I have one here and then three up there that I already showed just going to push the Centers of all of them in and then I will use the hook tool to help me grab and pull them out all right don't drop them great time to clean the inside of your pharynx great time you see what we'll do is we'll take off the heat shield right here as well for the exhaust so we can get to the filter all the way go taking the exhaust one office with a five millimeter comes in gladden right those ring don't drop it Oh drop it and push the oil pan over a little bit just in case I have slippery fingers these are full bolts knock your cord or twist locks hold up on one little bump guess you need another assistant yeah nice try let's try just don't want this thing to drop alright there we go we're the warning don't set this face down this is actual metal you don't want to get it all scratched up alright so what we're going to do is wait for this to drip a little bit more and then we will get to the oil filter and I'll show you why we have the aluminum foil standby hands weren't working and honestly the car one is way too big Napa way to go to Napa all right Lisa climbs to the rescue oh right this one is a two to three and a quarter inch from China here the dogs in the backyard they won out so give this hang a loosen alright number file for a reason see how that works fingers I can't with my fingers crazy wonderful nice good job something on a piece of paper so let this drain you back with you want us back alright everybody so this is almost done always a good practice is you're going to loop up the ring and I always put a little in there while this is almost done I spin it a little bit just to get it on the fins on the inside so we'll pour just smidgen in there dip my finger in there put a new o-ring wipe it off my finger and then well that's finalizing its drain I'll just spin this a little bit the oil on the other ring helps seal it alrighty so put this back on it's only going hand tight for now tighten it up in a second I want to clear all this stuff out of here make the dirty foil a nice little bed for itself alrighty so for the 2015 r1 manual and Yamaha says four point three three quarts of oil however if you're a YouTube or not YouTube but forum jockey you'll notice that some guys are doing just straight for slightly under four all that matters is that window make sure that your oil levels once you're full warmed up right it around the block needs to be sitting in between the two lines that's standard so what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and tighten this up we'll go around to the other side and we'll start putting the oil in see you in a second alright everybody we're back I'm going to start with the one gallon for coarse Yama Lu now if you're like me and you can't find your I'm losing my words oil filter filter okay flannel if you can't find the funnel in your garage you have permission for me to commandeer this from your wife's kitchen if you have a wife tell her it's uh I said you could hate mail you can go ahead and send that to P o box 1934 so in the Oregon nine seven zero five five you can address it to me so we'll go ahead and start filling this up let's take the entire gallon I did not give him permission I did when she was gone right my right so I don't trip on anything and there is four we will go check the window see we're sitting there right there of course we are on the paddock stand so we'll do is we'll go ahead and put the cap on it lower it from the paddock stand and we will start er up to get some oil in there and see where it sits be back all right everybody all the levels are good so now it's time to just go in reverse I'm going to put the push pins in first put the quarter inch turn screws on with the fairings and she'll be done if you like it click like you haven't already please subscribe it helps us out don't forget facebook.com slash ride 2 over 4 you can send us a message and you can get some custom vinyls made the page also shows all the colors we have available see you next time", "nzVuKTd5qCA": "you there are few basic things we need we need our oil funnel to make it easier to pour oil into the engine a measuring cup get the exact amount that we need your replacement some plug washer you will need to replace this this is very important our oil filter this is what I used to remove the oil filters distract oil filter wrench so just twists around the strap and it removes your filter and our extension bar just in case we can't leave the oil filter properly also we need lots of rags because there will be a mess on the headers and we have more at the pinna out next remove all the under panel and the left fairing if you don't know how to do this please do look at my how to install IMG frame sliders video and will explain how to get rid of the fairings in much detail you you you you you you you you you you okay so the part I didn't show you when I was taken off the oil filter now the method I use would be strap or a filter wrench didn't quite work this oil filter was so hard to take off it was unbelievable and in my frustration afford to record how it took it off so if you can see here big dent where basically my wrench just push straight in and bent the whole of the oil filter obviously if you try to do this before you realize that trying to get your hand into where the air flow oil filter is is pretty much impossible to try and twist off so my dad came up with an idea I've seen on YouTube as well before is pick a screwdriver and hammer in all the way through and then write it down so it twists off now at first when I had the screwdriver in and I pried it just cool down it literally only moved about that much and I had to dig another hole pry down a bit more dig another hole right down a bit more and there eventually it was loose enough for me to handle loosen the whole filter now you", "chBVSmKeTs4": "First thing you want to do is remove our\noil cap. It's gonna help the crankcase breathe properly. Up next, take an 8\nmillimeter Allen and unthread our drain bolt and let the engine oil drain\ncompletely. We don't want any of them contaminants left over in the system\nwhen we go to refill it. Now we'll just reinstall the drain bolt, but this time\nwe'll torque it to 17 foot pounds. You don't want to over tighten it because\nthe last thing you want is a sheared off drain bolt. Now we'll just remove our\nlower faring on the motorcycle. That's going to give us access to the oil\nfilter. Now using an oil filter wrench, we'll\njust go ahead and unthread the oil filter. When we go to put on our own new\nfilter, you don't have to lubricate the o-ring because thankfully Yamaha does\nthat for us from the factory. So we'll rethread our new oil filter in place and\nthis time we'll torque it to 12 foot pounds. Just like that. Now we'll clean\noff any of the contaminants-- it'll smoke if we don't clean that. Just reinstall\nour lower faring last time. It's still in place with two eight millimeter\nAllens. Now it's time to fill the engine. This\nparticular unit holds four point two quarts of Yamalube 1550. Move our funnel and reinstall our oil\nfill cap. Got it good and snug. Clean off the contaminants. And now, we're gonna\nstart the engine up, let it idle for a few moments, and then shut it off and let\nit sit for a few more moments.  Now it's time to check our level. Our level\nlooks great. It's time to hit the road", "eDhJ8MVBXNQ": "okay good morning everyone so today is a bike day for me again so we have a lot to do on a bike as you can see it's pretty dirty right here a little rust but today is gonna be all about the bike we got some oil out to swap out I um I think I'm one quart short but I have a little bit more over there for the bike we can be changing the oil because this thing is dirty know if you see that but it's pretty black right there change the oil in a while another maintenance thing that you guys want to keep up with is lube in the chain so you want to keep this chain lube well lubed every three to five hundred miles or if you're in like an area where there's a lot of road and grind lot of road the hell does I even mean a lot of debris a lot of road grime and all that because you can see it gets caked on and I don't use like a grease I use like a spray Lube because it's not a splashy but I also have to adjust the chain because as you can see there's a lot of play to show me be about it I think an inch or something like that with the play don't quote me if anything I'll put it up on the screen but I'm going to show you how I do it and how I go about it like I said I got to wash this bike to some surface for us there another thing that I need to do is this exhaust keeps coming loose as you can see so I did order the springs unfortunately I only ordered two of them by accident and I thought I ordered four and I didn't so at least we can get those on over here the other side of the exhaust is pretty good but I'm going to be giving you guys a full first-person view of it I'm also going to have this camera rolling as well maybe I might switch back and forth but majority of the video is going to be all first-person and yes I'm actually wearing my helmet in the garage people already looking at me well we have a lot to do on this bike so let's get right into it and let's get started this is this is what I deal with when I work near and daddy shop first thing you want to do is you want to start the bike it doesn't have to be super hot you just want to let it run for a few seconds to get the oil kind of pressurized and that's pretty much it though since I'm not like most people that work on their vehicles I don't like my hands getting too dirty you know poses a real problem when I want to take sips of beer so first things first you're gonna want to take this belly pan off all right off to the side so another trick you guys can do you don't have to do this I like to do this I put some Reynolds Wrap on everything basically what you're doing is you're covering just like the exhaust and that's basically for when everything if everything drips so there's a nice little trick I get to cheap one it's like four bucks for that you know you don't need to have really expensive Reynolds Wrap just some cheap aluminum foil works just fine and that's basically if stuff drips down it'll drip over here and it won't actually get on your exhaust get my little pan another thing I forgot to tell you guys I don't know why I skipped this step but you want to top the front wheel just all the bikes doesn't start rolling forward and you made it now so I'm gonna let that drain out [Music] the trick you guys can do I do it on my truck whenever I change the oil on there so what I do is a hammer hole into the filter and I let it drain so if it's at like different angles or I mean vice it really doesn't matter but if you're doing it on your car what that does is it it'll drain the filter so you don't make like a huge mess when you take it off and like I said that is coming in clutch right now because it's still no oil on the actual what's this thing called a motorcycle so I choose the cane and this is the w2w this is the tool 4-1 this is made for the r1 I'm sure works on other bikes as well but I simply use this because it does have this on it it's not because I want it to I think that this does better or something or whatever so we're going to put the bolt back in oh no don't drop it oh God so these don't have to be down these don't have to be torqued that tight that should be good right there you don't want to talk it too much because it'll start stripping threads out there next thing you want to take a little bit of oil doesn't matter it could be the old oil there's already grease that comes on these gaskets but I put a little more a little more oil in there doesn't matter if it's a used oil doesn't it's not gonna hurt it another thing you want to do you want to put oil in the actual filter and what that does is it so when you get the initial start up the filter isn't running dry that works and I'm gonna take this off [Applause] see that works like a charm now you don't have to worry about smelling basically what you're going to do now is not at the window I don't know if the camera is picking that up but the window is full it's clear so basically what you're going to do now is you're going to start the bike and let it run yeah that's looking good so we're at the top of the window right now you wanted to double-check and make sure nothing is leaking pretty good dry that completes all the change you guys made do it a different way but that's how I do it real simple real easy real quick so next step we're gonna Lube the chain up so I'm gonna put the bike back up on the jack and I'll go over exactly how I do that and here's what you're going to really just need this is the only stuff you will need so I have some kerosene over here basically what that's going to do is you're gonna soak the entire chain in kerosene and you're gonna rotate the wheel as you go and you're gonna let that sit for like five or six minutes and what I do is I have these two brushes I've a soft bristle brush and then I have kind of like an aluminum one that's the they're pretty soft or stiff bristles but it's soft enough and the reason being is because this chain has little seals in it so you don't want to use something too coarse where it's gonna damage anything and one of the other things I'll use is a pj1 blue label on this is a like a lubricant that's not greasy so it's not gonna splash all over your wheels and want now I've had nothing but success with this one it's kept the chain lube kept it pretty good another thing I use is you can use either towels or a microfiber I use an old microfiber they see after you scrape all the gunk off I like to wipe the entire chain and rear sprocket down and then I will go over the second time scrub it and do the same repeat the process twice wipe it down and then what I like to do is sometimes spray a little a little water on it to get any gunk that's that's built up anywhere else you can also use towels as well whatever tickles your fancy okay so first thing I'm gonna soak this in kerosene what I'll do like to do is I like to grab an old movers blanket and I'll throw that underneath so you don't get any kerosene down here because kerosene is very very flammable you don't have to be cheap with it you can spray this on like crazy but I use as for my reference point is your main link okay that's what I use where I know when that comes back around that's when I know okay I'm good to go so I'm gonna let this sit for like five minutes or so and then I'll come back and I will start scrubbing it a few moments later okay so this is set for a little bit so I'm gonna go ahead and use the aluminum one first and you're just gonna simply just scrub that's it and you're just trying to pretty much just break all like any grit and grime up so chain wasn't too too terrible so I'll probably just do this once normally I'd do it twice but I think with this time I'm just gonna do it the one time and kind of be done with it because it looks still pretty good where's my linked chain right there and you're just wanting to just kinda just go over just like this and not just go back and I kind of just wipe the actual sprocket off and that's it that's pretty much all I do when I lose my channel and you'd like I said do it every three or five hundred miles it's supposed to help with stretch and wear because if you don't lube it up the chain starts stretching even more and you're probably gonna have to change it a lot more often alright so that's gonna do it for the actual maintenance part of the bike the recap what I did I didn't end up adjusting the chain I will be going to bhp Motorsports to have them do that I did however I cleaned it and I lubed the chain up I clean my sprocket I showed you guys that ended up changing the oil so this bike is actually running really really good still the chain is the only thing that gets me nervous so there you have it there's some minor maintenance you guys can do on your bike but I'm gonna go ahead and end this video here I hope you guys enjoyed it so for me in Hades we want to thank you guys so much for watching make sure you guys subscribe like leave me a comment as always stay hungry stay humble and I will see you guys on the next one peace too many thoughts in my mind I can't sleep at night so I just keep writing I don't need no help by joining opinion so don't waste our time killing a gay man I gotta go ask anybody they heard about it they know when they kidding these baton ain't no when he kidding a bit and I get it my way better selector whenever", "FlME41rHCp8": "hey guys these typical soccer parents a I'm doing an oil change and in 1999 llaman are one let's get started I'd you probably see you down there I'm looking through the side faring there's the oil filter totally down there so we're going to get access to it we're going to pull off this lower they have a couple of Phillips heads alright and a couple mounting Phillips head there we're just gonna pull this belly pan off and get it out of the way alright guys neither just juice fasteners so you can loosen tighten them just with a half a turn so there's tight and there's loose I think you have one on each side it's all the way down at the bottom right here that's a standard Phillips head one on each side all right now I'm just working this off you want to try to get these out pull them out of the way they're made to stay on so they don't fall off these little washer on the other side just pull this top faring out of the way a little bit and if you take this one off it makes a little easier but it's not hard pop this side off and we'll do the other side alright guys now the lower panel off we have easy access to our filter right here and our drain plug right there so let's get on my draining guys if you want to save yourself some grief about it and oil all over your exhaust put a plastic bag or these I only ranch a little bit there barely warm well you can use like a piece of foil and put it underneath there so when you drain and it just hits that and drains into your into your catch and it doesn't get all over your exhaust okay is lower both to seventeen millimeter so we're going to pop that loose I'm gonna grab my oil filter I like using pair of pliers like this it's made for it makes it easy you have to worry about your hands slipping and stuff with that during a little bit before I take the filter off I have a recycle place around me that takes the oil make sure your filters too they got a lot of oil in them to try to find a recycle place it takes filters also so you don't get in that oil in our environment alright guys whenever I get the new filter I always just kind of match it and make sure that it's it's the same rings sometimes you'll get the wrong ones depending on where you're getting it from I put a little bit oil on the o-ring a little bit on the threads just to help it spin good make sure everything is clean now when it grabs all right the directions usually say let it grab and three-quarters of return to a turn stoop by hand you don't need to really wrench the thing on there okay good so let's just drink some more shoes it's done go put the club back in fact we're down to a drip I'm gonna get and put the drain bolt back in you don't have to make this gorilla tight either okay got a lot of bikes come in here to strip drain plugs are on the verge of being stripped get in there you can feel the gasket touch okay gasket touches right there okay that's it it's all you got to do don't sit down gorilla tighten the things strip it all right so oil and filter are done I'm gonna refill the oil I'm putting in customer supplied the oil so just will don't put it in there all right let's go put that in all right so capacity on this is twenty-seven hundred CCS listed right here which is like two point eight quarts there's also a window on it right here we're gonna pay attention to the window I was pouring it in and this bottle has markings on the side of it so I'll know we're just about rights we got one two three quarts we're gonna be down down to about this much of it in there so that's a little over two and a half you can see where it's at right there I'm gonna go ahead and fire it up and running for a little bit I'll go throughout the system and let it get into the oil filter and everything then I'll let it sit again and we'll top it off first we went ahead and put this lower on just so that the headers don't get you hot when I'm putting it on makes it easier less chance of burning myself all right so I ran it a little bit and let it warm up chart off let it sit and you see where I'm at nothing so he's right below the line there so I'm gonna bring it up to where it should be alright so there we go we're topped off and write about what I said 2.8 all right guys so that's all there is to it simple oil change on 1999 yamaha r1 a lot of the old ones are about the same so it's you know it's easy make sure you keep up on your oil and stuff don't neglect it hopefully this helps you guys out get the oil change done that I want I'm gonna do a couple other full things on this bike to get alright and a couple little adjustments and stuff and hopefully like this video helps you out guys so next time please like subscribe hit the bell for further notifications share this video if you can and I'll see you in the next one guys tech Cossack repair", "v_rUNae7I_A": "okay guys today we're gonna do an oil change video 2006 r1 this beauty right here and first thing you'll want to do is pull these two bolts out right here and get this one up here in the middle and then get this one back here and there's one down here hiding the up every time you're gonna want to squeeze this little bad boy out of here and just drop it down like that sink into your old filter which is right here uh mr. old antiques monster point and we do it okay so being uh we're not prepared today I got a hole in a Hannah fries thingy very expensive you're gonna need a an H five for me anyways I think the I think some of them are like this but oh well and then which this one is H five it comes back through these are of that market for determined gave things it's gonna reach in here good and hot and pour it all over the ground make sure you do that that's how I like to do it usually I'm just selecting [Music] oh yeah let's drain pretty good I'm gonna pull it off just stop it any fuss about it little it's yummy I shouldn't look at bad as my mother would make sure you get it on your pairings make sure you get it on your faring so you have something to clean up later or you could be cool and just not do that and not make a mess next thing you want to do as you want to get you a little 7 ml of 17 millimeter like this it can be any brand obviously nobody gives a and this is my bastard child ratchet it's a it's a Mac on I call them icons kind of Mac yeah then you're gonna want to reach under here and you're gonna find your drain plug which is a rut rut right here somewhere yep I don't know if you can see it was right there that's right there coming out of it yeah that's definitely yeah that's it roughly right there your drain plugs are there misuse your 17 millimeter must have been changed or like some people they like up and uh yeah sorry we're gonna get under here we're gonna we're gonna get our uh we're gonna go the right way first of all pull Oh one day and then you're gonna make sure you drop it in your old thing so you got to dig it out later order some do that cuz I grab ahold of it and as you can tell the oils not too bad not too bad and just little drink and drink and drink and we're back - you just omit a guy part one and a half make sure that you have more oil in your bike than the container you're dragging in it into so that it overflows like it's about to do right about now there goes it's gone it's everywhere god it's so bad it's getting worse it's going towards your tire we should go take some tight corners after this so when you be dumb and you're not prepared be prepared with some cleanup solutions and just dump it all over everything that happens especially when you're hurt in a hurry for old age so then when it's have a flow like that you just kind of splash it out between your fingers off and make sure you don't do that anymore [Music] somebody stole my rain thingy so I guess we use that okay back for part two now yeah alright so time out you have I went to put the locals are in their pose all right no one ever still trained everywhere looks great [Music] random paper bag plastic bag paper paper paper bag okay well when you get that completely up I use Wix filters they're usually the best filters without going with the actual like motorcycle racing filters wig filter number is five one three five eight they're about 12 bucks something like that of O'Reilly not too shabby you know you're the race filters but javis okay so what's getting done come please everything up you're gonna take and you're gonna take a little bit of oil you're gonna stick your finger in it because they sound like the most important thing to take it stick a finger in there get you some oil on your finger and just rub it all over this area right here getting nice and moist some people like to fill up the filters there's the pointing right so moister than an oyster you gotta take you gonna shove it right in here get it right back in there yeah put this out of his way so he can see it's been an all nice and pretty like [Music] heads that make sure you tighten this really well really well because uh I just had one that backed off and you want to have a burp in the background while you're eating table while you're eating tater tots as they couldn't put this in a better location right back so once you got it good and tight I mean this was your hand obviously they're gonna take your 17 millimeter you gonna clean it up and make sure you get all the nastiness off of it of the keys shove it right back in the hole stick in the hole which is obviously done in the same places as Plus haha thanks five hasn't moved just saying oh absolutely I need a good cameraman email who again takes that something flashed whole leg antics at gmail.com yeah that one or don't see there's fine either is just fine you're taking you're gonna get all knit so funny thing is I have a motorcycle it's at home and I can't get it in my motorcycle room so yeah tighten it up okay then you're gonna try to wipe your excess out of here gonna burn you know when you look at it so really doesn't matter it's just just guys if they can cover that up so doesn't get in there you're gonna put this back to how it was you're gonna take a little in my case ah5 and that's got all the cord turns back you gotta love Porter turns these are usually the pain-in-the-ass ones getting lined back up make sure you get both them before you tighten the first one up get a little quarter turn go quarter turn make sure a lot good and then this one down here don't fall out because it's stupid you want to make sure you get this one in there and for whatever reason this one likes to cross thread every time so just be careful it's nice and snug not too much why I like a quarter turns because you can't really ever take them oh sure simply dumbass good but I took yourself for no apparent reason because it's just you guys okay tater tots are gone and the drain plugs tight so now we're gonna grab a funnel and stop filming this bad boy up this all change brought to you by Sonic and their amazing boneless chicken nuggets cuz you're good and their tater tots I wasn't looking at your butt hey guys this thing will do it make sure you have it clean funnel keyword clean make sure you clean it out break clean and uh some kind of rag or something gentle you're gonna take this little fancy guy off right here I can never find a good enough size screwdriver so just do it or works set it right there yeah it's a nice little fancier and on you safer driver in there I think it puts a little funnel in there and make sure you get your bike as upright and scarily close to falling over as you can like like like like it's right there then you're just gonna kind of watch your glass down below and usually these take about I think three in almost four quarts I think so we're just going to do a round about that and keep eye out for it [Music] sometimes it's best to put some in there and start it up and let it run for me everything flowing nice and good but usually you want it about half way up that little glass right there give it a second to flow through there settle out okay see how it's kind of about halfway up that's pretty much where you want it I usually put it right there and start it up and let it run for a few minutes and put everything float through and that was a nasty burp in the world oh my god yeah having an agent week then just starting up a letter on put a flow to referred minute or two and it's a little old camp in cousin splash all over the place they didn't have to be tight it would make sure you actually put it in there like that are they asking this [Music] [Laughter] [Music] boy okay back off third up here and just uh fill it up until you've got halfway up the sight glass again do it slow because it will take you [Music] okay that is good right there make sure you say whatever you have extra I have some bikes leak some burn this one's usually crazy I didn't have any problems with it and put your little cap back on there you're putting cat back on your whole thing if you drop it on the ground make sure you drop on the ground first pull this back out of here and melt his going to be tight just wrapped around till it's things up and you're good to go it's all done Mike [Music]", "7pKqNHhezkQ": "Okay, first thing we want to do is remove\nour oil fill cap. That's gonna help the crankcase breathe properly when draining\nour engine oil. With that, we're gonna remove our lower faring. It's held in place with\nfive four millimeter Allen bolts. Just remove the bolts and there's a pushpin\non the lower fairing that you got to pop out of place, then it'll come right off.\nNow using a seventeen millimeter socket, we'll remove the drain bolt and let the\nengine oil drain completely. While the oil is draining, it's a good idea to\ncheck the condition on a crush washer. If it's missing or damaged, you'll want to\nreplace it to prevent any future leaks. Now we'll go ahead and reinstall our\ndrain bolt and torque it the 31 foot-pounds. Now using a 65 millimeter\noil filter wrench, we'll go ahead and remove the old oil filter. You just\nsimply thread it off. So just take your time because it's pretty tight in there,\nso it may be a little bit of a pain to remove. Now when installing the new oil\nfilter, luckily Yamaha pre lubricates the gasket\nfrom the factory so we don't have to apply any oil to the gasket. We simply\njust thread it in place and torque it to 12 foot-pounds. And we'll take some contact cleaner and\nspray off the exhaust manifold to prevent any smoking when are we fire it\nback up. Now we'll go ahead and reinstall the lower fairing. To do that, we just\nrepeat the same steps in reverse as before. Now it's time to fill the engine\nwith oil. Yamaha states that this unit holds right\nat four quarts of Yamalube 10W40 motorcycle oil. Now we'll reinstall our\noil fill cap. After that, we're gonna start the engine up, let it idle for just\na few moments. That's when we get the oil circulated through the system properly.\nThen we're gonna shut it down and let it sit for a few moments. That way we can\nachieve an accurate oil level reading. Leading at the site glass, we want to be\nin the middle to upper portion of the site glass. And this looks great, so let's\nhit the street.", "xCJMs9JmA0U": "all right so the first thing I did was remove the lower fairing off the bike if you look here on the top section there are six bolts or six screws that hold it in up top on each side and on the bottom there's two screws one here and the other one there so I'm told there's gonna be six seven eight ten screws that hold this lower fairing loss once you get the lower fairing off you just gonna have your exhaust you can see the exhaust wrap it's kind of falling off and being there for years things that we're gonna worry about under here is gonna be your oil filter which is their starting lighting sucks and your drain plug which is here so there's your drain plug that takes a 17 millimeter you're gonna most likely get a wrench like this because the socket don't fit for the filter we can just unscrew that so I'll get my pan over I'll start draining it okay so I've broken the drain plug loose you can see this one was a little stripped so it's very difficult for me to break it free but I did so I got my drains and here gonna take the plug out I'll let that drain and then take out the old filter we'll see how that goes look at that milky black that stuff news yeah it's needed an oil change so you can see the this is how it was a little rounded off definitely gonna want to replace this because it's gonna suck when you got to take it out next time alright so ran to a little snag here the oil filter you can see it's kind of close to the headers here what you need is an oil filter wrench I don't have an old filter wrench here with me at home so I'm gonna do is bang a screwdriver in here like a flathead screwdriver into this and twist it off that way so let's get to it alright so I did this caveman style couldn't find a regular Phillips head screwdriver so I used this one and I took a ratchet and just banged it banged a hole into the side of the filter and then once you get your whole bangs kind of see it I will go that and you can see the filter is moving now so once you get the filter to move a couple inches it should be loose enough for you to get it off by hand so now you can see filters coming off so that this is what happened next time I go to change the oil I purchased the K&N oil filter that has a socket on the end of it well it's a spot for soccer I believe it's a 17 mill the double check but I'll grab that for you and show you alright this is the other bike here you get see that's see this is almost a zoo key it has this little piece on the end here where you can stick a socket on so that way it's a little easier well this bike does that more access in general for it so I always recommend go into that filter that way you don't have to have a filter wrench to get them all filters off all right so what you've a place to filter and made sure the filter is tight and you all drink August tight you wanna get your funnel you want to fill the oil here right there on the side all right where the clutches at just take a filter a funnel in there the bike takes three and a half quarts we have here a four quart jug so I'm gonna pour three quarts in start the bike up and check and see where it's at just like that I'll be back in a second alright so once you put the oil on I'll just put the oil cap back on here and what you're gonna do this come down ripe a little bit clutch there's a sight glass there's a dot here and a dot here you want the older generally be in between these dots I'm so another major key with this you got to measure it with the bike standing straight up so on a side stand it's a little over to the bikes left side you're gonna want to get it off the kick snare hold it up as straight as you can which is about there and then you're gonna look at it in the glass so you can kind of see here it looks it's up to the top line once I start the bike it's gonna go down a little bit once the oil starts flowing and goes into the filter I stop so that's why you don't want to put it all at once you want to start the bike for about five seconds let the oil start circulating and then check it again that's enough just to get the whole flowing now as you can see sight glass looks empty the bike is now straight up and down and you can't even see me all in it I told me because I put about 228 courts in there so I'm gonna put the rest of the oil in do the same exact thing let it run like the old circulate again and an object beside glass all right so I just ran the bike again for a couple of seconds about five ten seconds and now the bike is sitting straight up and down you can see the oil is right around the top line it's exactly what you will have to be in so it took the about three and a half quarts just like the manual said so after you make sure you're always correct actually you can do these two steps vice versa um you wanna look around your oil filter make sure there's no leaking as well as the plug so I check both of those already there's no leaks so we're good to put the buck back together", "1unyTUKyvS0": "hey guys what's up yeah I'm a crazy r1 here it's a beautiful day out in the bay I thought I'd get some maintenance done start by changing the oil on my r1 this is a 2005 Yamaha r1 for those of you that are new to the channel so first step in changing the oil on this bike is to remove the lower fairing I've already taken the other side off [Applause] okay now that I have the lower fairing off I just wanted to point out the oil filter is right there nut is right there this nut is 17 millimeters now it's best and the manual recommends that you change the oil on the kickstand not on a rear stand you'll notice that the oil plug is on the left side of the pants and when you tilt the bike on to the kickstand it's going to make sure everything drains out now that all the oils done draining out the plug back in tighten it back up new filter oil on the o-ring help it seal you and there we go no oil filter in oil out now we just need to recycle the oil and fill her up all right the next step is to fill it what I do is take two crescent wrench now that I have three quarts in here there's a window right here that shows you there's lines marks with this and this in between this is where you want the oil to be so I let it run for a few minutes four or five six minutes shut her off let any of the you know oil that drips on to the headers from the oil filter burn off shut it off for a few minutes and then come and check it out and we're pretty close you can see the bubble right there that's the top indicator mark that's the bottom indicator mark on both sides and I'm right at the top line with everything looking good no leaks all we have left to do is put the lowers back on and there you have it you guys she's ready to ride again any questions any comments anything you'd like to see leave them below don't forget to hit subscribe and click the bell see you on the next video", "Q_CmQEnSHpQ": "I like to show people how to strum only using these two guys so let's start with just the thumb all the thumb has to do is go down come on yeah there put it just go down on your thumb crazy that's it forefinger forefinger can't go down only town only everybody oh yeah okay [Music] never [Music] that's all and you know what you pick the one that you like the best there is only one pattern that I teach people to do and I'll show you that right now because we can all do it first of all I want you to listen [Music] do that okay and if I slow it down like this watch my right hand that's my right hand is doing try that everyone this forefinger goes down and it comes back on what direction does the thumb move thin down so when the forefinger goes down and before it comes up my thumb goes down okay and then the fourth finger comes up that's all this is the purpose of the right politically is to put feeling is to put emotion in the music and generally the way we do that is slow down speed up and all you got to do is just practice [Music] [Music] [Music]", "87q1JM4wagg": "[Music] hey friends this week I'm going to break down a little ragtime strumming technique known as the flick this is a great way to spice up some of those tunes from the 20s and 30s especially the faster ones when you want to get out of your comfort zone of just playing quarter notes and eighth notes one of the great things about this technique is that it really gives us the natural accents that we look for in this type of music which are accents on 2 & 4 without us having to worry about strumming harder on those beats we're using a different part of our hand to make those access so let's dive right in the basic stroke here is just quarter notes four quarter notes per bar but what's unique is we're going to strum beats one and three with our thumb and beats two and four with our first finger the nail as we would generally strum so that doesn't quite get us the sound right so what we need to change here is that our thumb stroke is only going to hit maybe our bottom two strings if it hits the bottom three strings that's okay too it doesn't really matter too much in its imprecise and then our index finger will strum all the way through the stroke so it will sound a little bit something like this so you can be hear that beats two and four are just naturally a little bit louder because we have that nice attack of our fingernail here one other thing that we need to keep in mind is that the wrist motion that we use to play this is really identical to if we were just doing four down strums per bar see the fluidity of the wrist here we want the same thing which is opening up the hand and catching with our thumb so what you do is practice four down strokes and then the flick four bar and keep yourself honest about just keeping the wrist motion nice and fluid now there is something else we can add to this and this is really the flick portion of it is once you're comfortable with just the four strokes to a bar whenever we have the thumb we can follow this up with a quick upstroke with our index finger with the pad of our index finger and this will again just catch really the top three two or three strings or so and it will be eighth notes so we can start this out it's generally played on beat three and I'll show you in a moment how we can place it on other beats as well so if we put it on beat three very slowly it will look like this thumb index yeah let's try that together just a basic pattern on a C major chord one two three four now down now as I said that's generally where we would place this eighth note but any place that we have the thumb we can put this so we can also put this on beat one and start off the measure with this little flick on there so we'll be starting out with two eighth notes and then three quarter notes it'll sound like this let's try that together what two three four good now we can also put these two together and do our little flick on beats one and three so of two eighth notes a quarter note two eighth notes and another quarter note it'll sound a little bit something like this try that one together what two three four very good and you want to change this up as you're playing not just use one for an entire song if we had to flick on every beat one and three we'd get pretty tired of that fairly fast so it's good to always revert to just our basic pattern of the thumb index thumb index as our basic quarter note strum and just spice it up with some of those other eighth notes in there now in a minute what we're going to do is play together a little a two that I wrote based around the tune Darktown Strutters ball which has fairly basic chords mixing up all of these little flick strokes that we just went over one two one two three four [Music] I hope you've enjoyed this lesson if you have any questions as always please feel free to reach out or just leave your questions down in the comments below

"hi guys so I'm got we have an oil leak on my bike right about here it's all accumulating around underneath here after even a very short ride I think it's I've changed this I've changed this bolt these both of these bolts are brand new after the slide I had as you can see I've got the rod rush around here and I'm thinking it might be coming out of here so I want to do is put the camera on stand of it and see if I can locate the the leak Oh God so I've gathered that through my leak is coming out from here as you can see I've kind of them painted it over touched half of it so what we're gonna do is try grind this down with my Dremel and didn't test it again because I can't really see it I'm pretty sure it's coming out of here all I'm going to do is grind this down a little bit and just to remove some of the paint and I'm going to start it up again and see if I can clearly see where the oils coming out from here or not use my little dremel bit here don't want to go too drastic on this side of my engine casing so you know very soft and it was just coming off quite easily so I'm go ahead and start the bike up again and see if I can see where the oil is leaking out from it's a bit more clear not coming out from right inside here I'm going to go up in the give me a few revs and see lockers so it's definitely coming out of this little hole here now the question is how we tackle this because this is right really soft material I don't I don't think you can just go and world it with any kind of a world Stachel engine casing I'm thinking I'm gonna give it a goal and what I'm gonna try and do is use a bit of jb weld on this and I'm going to give that a go first see how that goes so I'm gonna go ahead and clear up the remainder of this area and try walk about a JB world on there and see if that if that helps okay so here's the JB world is the bottoms I'm really strong epoxy glue type world and I've seen a few videos people have tried it on all sorts of engine parts casings and whatnot so I thought I'll give a guy's not too expensive so what you do is then put this plastic lid here got my wooden ice cream stick there so what they want us to do is a mix an equal amount of both of the solutions so I'm going to go ahead and do that now gum is the top block okay open next one so I'm not gonna need too much for that tiny little feast I'm doing so good until about that much is already way too much but let's just go for it soon that had black stuff that's above and I'll do go shut the lid on that shut the lid on that go to mix this up it's quite it's just quite sticky quite harder you want to mix it up until it's all fully mixed together till it turns a grayish color this will remain pliable for up to 25 minutes and those two tubes I've just used apparently if I put the lids back on I can use them for up to 25 years gotta give that a good mix so I'm gonna try and apply this sticky solution as you can see so next up the garden fine be liberal with this without dripping smell off you can't you some sticky stuff as you can see what it's such a small area so making a bit more difficult I want to give you a couple of coats layer by layer I'm trying to get all the surrounding areas as well so - look - Missy over this stuff what once it's hardened you can actually sand it down and do all sorts apparently so I mean I can always apply it liberally and then send it down if need be I want to be quite liberal around this and that's where the the hole was okay Oh guys so it's been about 24 hours since I put the world on debut won't this as I was looking looking quite solid one will do is a good to start her up and see if anything dramatic happens so I've had it running for about five minutes so far so good so one would do is a takeover spin now and see what happens okay so I just got back from a half an hour right Mike is fully warm it's actually very hot the fan is just that came on as I pulled in but by the looks of it the world is um held up there's no leaks no oil dripping anywhere the world looks exactly as it was and yes so far so good I'm really impressed with that so pick up JB world this is a do some serious stuff guys give you a gold piece", "qwXNtHRA_9I": "[Music] got a feeling i'll see you later there's something about you let's keep it moving and if it's a good [Music] i'm thing some connection to the things you do i

cooler guard set 2015 Yamaha YZF r1 stock a little bit about the product right anodized aluminum it's very lightweight you really not adding weight to the motorcycle and as compared to the the stock right oil cooler card that's on there it's funny they'll put a oil cooler guard on it not a rainy day desired from the factory you'll notice the weave on this is just a little bit tighter okay how important is this well let's just say that I've had more than one friend that's been out there race and took a rock to a radiator put a hole in it and burnt down a motor all during race right because they didn't have a guard in place this is going to sit in such a way it creates a little space between the radiator itself and the guard right small enough we but it's gonna catch the debris for track riders important for street liars maybe even more important you're out on the road right the space is a lot of our roads you're not in phenomenal shape you take impact to that radiator okay and say you're on a trip you're a couple hundred miles away from all the thousands of miles another case may be you're done you're gonna race track you put your stuff back on the trail but at the end of the day okay you're on the street you're done so there is definitely need for this products but a great brand for us been selling these for quite a while with a lot of success comes with all the pieces you need to install it and I have to say - they did a really nice job with the instructions got color photos to give you an idea of what it should look like what we're gonna do here is we're gonna we're gonna supplement that with what you have to do disassembly wise on the motorcycle to actually get these pieces on the radiator and the oil cooler guard alright gain access this round made this project as easy as possible on myself so what I'm going to do I'm gonna pull off my side bearing says nose fairing down here on the bottom a couple of little inner pieces as well done this about a million times already on the air one cool quick release quarter turn stock has now pretty sweet then pull those bad boys off yup we want up here on the top leg so I'm gonna go to the other side do the same thing hoping to take this motorcycle back to Gratton Raceway with my friends from sports like track down fourth of July weekend pretty super sweet they also have a ladies first day that's happening a couple of push pins here maybe on Friday preceding that weekend as well we will of course be there in support of their ladies first event we have our marketing manager don't Fuller's gonna be out there helping the ladies enjoy their day slide that forward like so right pretty simple all the little push pins and such are reusable after we did our coolant change to you can see you know if you ride a few times that level dropped a little bit so I'm going to top that off while I'm in here to over to the other side you have to look closely in hearing this see there are several of these little pushpins right it's a two-piece deal push it in so it's flush it's locked down to release all right you depress the center tab and when you go to reinstall push it through like that put it in position push down until it's flush can reuse those things over and over again which is pretty nice more up here it's forward motion all right you can see the clips they have in place here lock it in so we put it back on then slide it backwards okay last piece we need to get off if this little nose fairing down there actually using a wobble extension here five millimeter L and all that's it from the factory there is thread Locker on this fastener it comes out just a little bit harder we'll need to have this one off to gain access to the oil cooler itself on fastener on each side you also see there is a spacer we need to keep as well you look at the radiator on this bike you can already see there are a couple of demos on that's taking a couple of shots already to release this the rest away just lift up we'll start off by comparing the stock oil cooler dard with the piece very similar in design I will say this slide does feel just maybe just a tickle heavier but you're going to clearly see a big size difference in that we've okay the one on the right here is the piece clearly this is gonna block a whole lot more than that I would also say that the negative effect on the cooling is going to be very negligible so I wouldn't be concerned with that at all to install this very simple he designed this to be a direct fit piece drops right over those tabs you can see that lines up fantastic like - piece of cake and now for the radiator guard you'll see that he supplied it cable ties right total of five there's one more there than you need and we're gonna look at this here and get an idea of what they want to see in terms of insulation and if you look at the radiator and let's try and get you to zoom in real nicely stay right here okay you can see that this is actually where the core of the radiator comes together with the tanks okay and there is a void right here okay there are no radiator fins right there right there's just basically an aluminum support okay that is the area where the cable tie will pass through to secure that radiator guard okay so you're gonna find one of those essentially on all four corners of the radiator first thing we do is get the sticker off logo was gonna be retained in the bottom left-hand corner on that and with the guard what we wanted to do let's get this bad boy up in place so that it is essentially resting right against this support here on the right here both top and bottom when I say the support this piece of aluminum right here okay so rigid it's strong keeps it off of the fins like so okay so that's going to be held right in place like that okay I'll be honest we have never installed one of these before taking a look at and I believe I've developed an approach that I'm going to follow here I loosened up this electronics Bay as it attaches to the radiator here on the left side of the bike on the right side I loosened up that coolant overflow reservoir bottle and manipulate these a little bit and increase the level of access I have drop the zip ties right the cable ties in through these holes when we're done and I've got this all up in place how this is going to go is this is going to go pass through the radiator looper on the other side come up through here like so okay and then this that we'll call this the knob right is going to be on the back side of the radiator standing straight up and down okay that is how they show in the instructions and to me that makes them Constitution oh I'm going to put this up into place what I'm not gonna do is I'm not going to draw either cable tie tight right away okay I'm just gonna get it the first one up in there I'm gonna get it looped through and once I've done that I will start it and once I started it it'll keep it in the position which would be nice no won't be fighting anymore you could probably do a little bit more disassembly here but I think just a little patience and be able to make this work at that cable typefaces through there right now and getting it till to loop through here's a little bit of a challenge pretty good idea here once I get this started through on the one side I think that's gonna be a real benefit you know you could probably pull off your front tire you know let's say that you're building the full race plate you could organize the installation of all your parts in such a way that you know you're putting this side and got the front end of her all those things would make this a little easier but realistically I think most of us are probably gonna end up doing something similar what I'm doing right now which is just you know installing every part has their received okay I think that's gonna be the tough one I've got that one started notice how I've got it hanging nice and loose right if you draw that one tight it's gonna make getting this one in there real tough make sure you don't twist the cable tie alright get everything moving in the right direction push it through there definitely way more access on this side than we had on the other bring that through and position though both of these cable ties are started and now we're just going to work this bad boy into position so we can get this cable tile tile you done okay now I'll have a look two bottom ones real quick same deal here go ahead and get this up in the position these are going to be easiest of the four without question okay full access down here top a little bit tough way ok still I'm not even taking that up all the way because I'll make sure I've got a bit slack one sip I'll give you definitely make sure the bites cold I wouldn't run the motor before you do this it's not going to make the project go and easier okay all right now we're going to come back up here and pick up right where we left off we'll make sure I've got this guard position properly all the way around so I'm going to reference the photo one more time they have here instructions on the bottom got that bottom one square it off and they come over the other side do that as well and once the two of them on the bottom are completely in place that will position the top so they can't move and I'll just build it pretty much tighten those up it will without any worry okay at home we've done this you can see the support there at the cross support for the radiator right see a little bit of a protruding underneath that radiator guard it's gonna be the same case here on the top we have to do is draw these down tight and as I suspected this is a whole bunch easier once you have the bottom part holding it firmly I kind of use the screwdriver to push down on the then not if you will the locking mechanism for that cable tie all that tight tighten up the other side and we'll trim all these cable ties and then we're gonna be ready to reassemble the r-1 not a bad project the end of the day when you could make this easier to chose to by disassembling more I I would leave that up to your own personal discretion myself I always try to take off as little as possible probably got a lot to do with my former employee as a production of the camp I don't want to take more stuff off than you had to because I'm it takes water make less money all right I've got these all brought tight when I grab a pair of side cutters I'm gonna trim all of our cable ties and then I'll put the body work back on the bike okay I've got everything trimmed off in terms of the cable ties right on top off there it's in there nice and tight and then double check your trip to check it make sure you're good to go and once you feel you've got it it's time to put your bike back together pretty simple I'm just going to reverse the process all right used to disassemble a stove a lower nose Farren this drops on that oil cord just like the oil cooler guard does get that bad boy in position like so you got each side then we'll jump in there with our side bearings man if I had this plate apart a million times already I'm definitely working on this motorcycle more than I ride it right now and I'm excited for that to turn around and become hey I am wrenching I'm riding my motorcycle more than I read you oh those down okay grab side earrings into position okay to do that we've got the clips up front here push it in place pressure against it drop in there pretty easily clearly it started like so down here get these aluminum shields that are part of the exhaust that make sure the slots in the fairing go over the locator tabs on that shield itself got that look really scary sure any place so he's smashing it down here and got one up top here so pushpins yeah here when the fairies come together and all lined up again got caught by an offender a little bit into place the other side lock that into place come down here just like the other side make sure those locator tabs make it inside and we'll be back in business not a very difficult project end of the day I think this is one most riders could tackle on their own if you don't feel comfortable with it take your motorcycle to license motorcycle mechanic great place to go is obviously the dealer you bought take it in there nobody's gonna know your Yamaha better than your Yamaha Bueller ok there you double this is the Cox racing radiator in oil cooler guard set install our 2015 Yamaha YZF r1 STG project light you", "lqksSD3QuLI": "that's too big this one well i'm juggling now that's too big it was going right for the truck oh that's perfect don't toss that one here there are two bolts on either side on the bottom part of the fork i'm removing and the same thing for this side two bolts in the bottom side of the fork there are two bolts on the caliper you need to remove doing the same thing to the right side took the caliper off i just didn't move the camera over i'm sorry [Music] though and here i am just taking off the axle nut so here i'm taking off the two bolts located there's one on the handlebar riser and there's one on the actual shock itself [Music] oh [Music] and here there are two clamps on each shock you want to remove both the bolts on each clamp and here there are four bolts on either side of the fairing and now with everything removed you should be able to just grab hold of the shock and twist and slide and whatever you need to do careful the uh when you grab it or when you like slide it down it doesn't hit the floor it won't damage anything but you just don't want it to hit the floor and make any unnecessary marks on your shocks but pull it through and she should slide right out i have no idea what this clamp is that fell but if you know what it is feel free to comment in the section in the comment section sorry um i just put the i put the shock back on without it because i looked around on the bike and i couldn't find uh anything to show me like what this clamp was holding so um i just put it back on i i put the shock back on without putting this clamp back on i looked back through the through my video to see if it was holding anything and it wasn't holding anything it was just it was sitting on the shock and it's plastic so i don't think it was anything important so that's one shock off the other side is the exact same so i'm not going to do a video on that but there is one shock off so here we have a flat bed screwdriver looking bit it's the dampening screw i'm not pointing at the brass bolt on point there's a dampening screw on top of the brass bolt you want to counter clockwise loosen this off it will not come out just it will be it will be clicking so each click you have to count each click and then when you're putting it back when you're putting everything back together you want to count those clicks clockwise back to where they were before you took everything apart so here there's a dust cap seal on the shock absorber you want to put a flat bed screw flat blade screwdriver in between this and you can pop it off it doesn't take much it might take a little bit but it won't take too much you won't break anything you want to pop that off tip the shock absorber upside down and oil will drain out nothing is draining out of mind because it is completely empty hence why i'm doing this sealer replacement so here we are back to that brass bolt on top of the shock absorber you're going to want to hold the bottom end of the shock absorber while you're twisting this bolt so either you're going to need a vise for this as you can see because you cannot have this twist at all this thing is this brass bolt is very tight so you're gonna need a vise you can't just hold the shock so as you're twisting this off i it did not um when it came out it didn't explode out at me at all i in other videos i've i've been told that i'm sorry they have told you that the uh the shock will like bust out at you or whatever didn't do it to me but you're going to want to hold the bottom end because that will spin so there you have it it is loosened all the way out it did not pop out at me it you can hear it pop a tiny bit but it does not blow up at you so and then to take to get this apart you want to come to this end and on the inside here there's an allen key you want to take that apart or loosen it and that'll let you'll be able to slide that out there or sorry that's the one part you can slide that up all right so we were having i was having issues getting all this apart so what ended up happening is we we unscrewed that all the way we didn't touch this at all and we went to go unscrew that it wasn't unscrewing at all it broke free but it would not come out so what we did is we just pulled this oh is that gonna yeah we just pulled this all the way back we tightened that up so we tightened it up towards actually like it was tight and then we used like again we used the we didn't have anything special so we just used the one of these here allen key put it on the end of that socket and we started giving her some juice over here and she broke free everything came out and then uh yeah oh there we go yeah now we're good here so that's an update if if you're having troubles with this over here because we got it to break free it was broke it was broke like it would spin everything would spin but it would not come out it was weird so we had sorry i was not explaining this properly while i was doing this video so what we ended up doing was we would hold the the nut end i guess where the brass end was the brass bolt sorry we ended up holding we had to put pressure on that side i think what my dad did was he held it like he pulled he pulled down on it or pulled towards himself and then i ended up having to loosen off the allen key on the other end of it so it would just put it would put pressure it would put pressure on that screw so it was able to come out easy it wasn't coming out for us and it was just because there was no pressure on that screw head so here we are at the next part of actually replacing all the oil seals so there is a lock ring on the top and the very very first thing you'll see is a lock ring uh these needle nose pliers did not work for me i couldn't get in between um the lip of it i guess is whatever you would want to call it where you would actually take it out um so i ended up in a second here i'm going to grab for it was just like uh a pic i guess is the easiest way to call it i just use the pick and i was able to get at it really really easily here i'm about to take out the main oil seal i was not able to get it out with this pick as you're going to see on the video it cuts out i use the flat blade screwdriver to pry it out from the bottom i just uh it popped out pretty easily so just don't use a pick it didn't work for me got got the old brother over here ass up in the air working on the old i'm the old beater so what we did is we ended up getting those uh dust cap comes off those cups said this is really really nasty dust cap comes off and then this this washer here forgive me for calling this a washer i feel like an idiot now that i'm editing this video and notice i said that this is a main oil seal sits in this way we just put a screwdriver we just put a screwdriver in we just put the screwdriver in like that and kind of like popped it out i couldn't just grab that pick i had i couldn't use this pick i could pick it out and the uh we got it out that way and then you got this you got this one underneath there i got a full rebuild kit so i'm just rebuilding the whole thing i do not know how to work this goddamn thing yeah so we're gonna start rebuilding that make sure everything's clean in there you want it you want it as clean as possible in there man this i love this thing this new gimbal it's awesome that was and this is the uh this is the rest of the shock nice and clean we're not replacing anything on here besides that o-ring everything else stays the same fill it up with oil make sure it's all good that's it so i'm sorry i didn't include in this video of where to put the oil back in putting everything back together is pretty self-explanatory but i will show you where to put the oil in it's um it's pretty easy it's a half of it's a half a liter of oil per shock but i will show you right now where to put the oil so when you have your shock rebuilt but your top is not screwed into the block absorber you want to stand your shock upright and then you will dump your half a liter of oil into the shock please stay tuned for further videos of this bike as is getting a complete makeover for the winter coming into spring", "LduK1v2L-xM": "so I've already taken it out but I pieced you back together to show how it's going to come out the first few steps are kind of interchangeable so you can do much you need to but typically I would go ahead and just remove this filter there's three bolts see right here and then we're on the front oh come on once you do that you would probably just go ahead and take this return off if you bolt here one right here once that comes off you probably go ahead and take this return off it's one bolt right here there's also a sleeve down there but it'll go into just make sure you get it in that sleeve it shouldn't be an issue as it slips right in there kind of a one-way deal there then I would probably go ahead and unbolt this rocket now when you do so this engines obviously inverted so it's going to kind of fall down but with the engine right side up this sprocket should just kind of hang once you run both it and then you can just kind of leave it hanging over there because it won't be in the way next you're probably going to want to go ahead and undo this pipe in here now there's a connector hood here but it's very small very stiff so it's probably going to be easier if you just unbolt your oil cooler and pull both of these out at the same time keep in mind there's going to be quite a bit of or over change in here there's a little bit of coolant so you want to have a pan underneath when you unbolt it but once you unbolt this there's also a little boat right here just one next set hold on just here so once you do that obviously these will both slide out the same together then you can remove that but you don't have to technically remove it all the way but regardless once you do that there's going to be two bolts holding in the pump itself one right here and one over here now this back bolt here has a sleeve in it I've already removed it but this is the sleeve you need to make sure you remove that sleeve to allow the pump to slide out because if you don't remove the sleeve that won't flat out so once you remove that sleeve that's in there and it's a there's a little opening here so that you can get maybe a set of new your measures in there to pull that out but once you remove that sleeve then your pump will come on out you're kind of jimmied out of the hole and then you have your pump out and that's all you need to do", "cXbFGc75wjU": "there's my clutch some of my oil pump parts yep that's what I do a little work status of the bike got the water pump out it was kind of a difficult pull it all pays off water pump was up in their exhaust pull the exhaust fold the clutch cover under here pull the clutch see right through there down to the ground got front forks on the way to so I'll put my water pump my front fork hopefully by the end of next weekend I'll be rides", "8u_UxlXCvn8": "[Music] so picking picking is something we don't normally use with the ukulele there have been all sorts of different kinds of picks crazy felt picks that you play with that one makes just a real light sound if your strumming but it's not very good for single notes and it's really kind of heavy there there are several different kinds of picks that you can use why would you use a pick in the first place if you can play with your hands makes a beautiful sound strumming and all that but a pick is actually a pretty useful device I've noticed especially when you have to take a melody and make it loud like over a group or with a partner or something you can also use some really nice strumming with bass that's like a funk kind of strum or even more folk stuff like so flatpicking as it's called it's the kind of picking I do so that I'm gonna explain to you the way that I do it for this lesson and we'll go through the exercises that are in the magazine so I am using a heavy pick this one is my favorite but there are several different kinds we saw the felt pick already which is really thick and for some people that works great for strumming and it it it's easy to control take much but as I said if you play a single note with it it's really felty sounding here's another pick a small one that's actually a thin pick you see how it bends like that these are pretty good especially for beginners because they Bend with the string so you can play and you don't have to do the bending yourself so if I play a strum now listen to the thin pick on a single note if you use a thicker pick it actually has a nice more focused sound here's a medium pick and there's a big one some bass players use these large ones like this this would be a great pick for the you bass for instance and that's a medium so that's that's a kind of nice in-between where you can strum and still hit some melodies I personally play with a heavy one and then I let my fingers Bend a little bit over time may take a while so let's go through the exercises of how to use a pick the first thing that you want to do is figure out how to hold the thing because when you first start it might feel really strange angle at the strings what I do is I take my thumb flat out and put it on there and then around the outside you let your other finger go so if you look at it from the front it looks like this and from there it's not exactly straight but this one comes down at an angle a bit so you can hold it pretty much so that it's at a right angle to the strings and once you get used to it it's not so bad so let's start by just taking a few exercises this first one here I've got I'm written down is a minor to a b7 all we're gonna do is play downstrokes you can do it really slow just like an arpeggio one of the time get a feel for it and as you get better at let us do a little money for that now let's try just the upstroke this one with a pick it's a little different because you're gonna have to let the pick kind of go across the strings instead of pulling it tightly just let it go at an angle once again a minor 7 and put them together we have an a minor : here and then an E minor and then a b7 now back to the a minor let's go to the e minor doesn't matter what chords you used but down down and what I'm doing is I'm going back and forth a little bit and letting it just scrape over the strings you've never done this before it might feel really strange at first but I guarantee a little bit of picking in your toolbox will get you a long way especially if you start playing melodies let's go on to example two and this one is G chord C in a d7 here we're gonna take a normal folk strum we're used to like without a pick you go down down but there's your thumb take this exact same field as you normally do and let the pick be loose in your wrist but not in your fingers so you're holding it tight here but the rest of your hand kind of makes up for it okay you have to hold it tight enough that you don't lose it but also loose enough in your middle of your hand and your wrist that you can really let it flow takes a little while to get used to it when you jump in you'll find it's pretty easy also an example to the boom chicka and this is really useful here's that F a D minor a G minor 7 and a see where you go boom is kind of landing on the fourth string or just mid the fourth and third you snap it back and forth [Music] you can do it really lightly or you can do it pretty rough and loud and start speeding up and see how that feels [Music] it's one of the advantages of a pick is you can go really dig in like if ever playing that and I suddenly had to play a melody and you got so that can be really fun once you get some good picking technique let's jump over to example three here and we're gonna jump into an arpeggio style so usually here's an excerpt from the arpeggio meditations that were used to and this time we're just going to do use the pick down down down up down just get used to that feel and after a while and really directed make a nice sound so that exercise gets you going down down down up the next one I've got for you actually takes it back and forth a little bit so we're gonna go we're gonna go across the strings down down down and take a look at it takes a little while get used to this gonna be four three two three one two three - okay nice and slow it's gonna get to a place where you can really use it little quicker but for now nice and slow [Music] an F minor [Music] so that's all the course from the original arpeggio meditation but using the pick to go nice and slow down up down up I can barely say it you have to do it nice and slow and so that really settles in once you learn that exercise you'll really have some picking control so go nice and slow be nice to yourself because this is all brand new if you've never used a pic before but that one will really get you some technique okay so the last thing I have for you is more of a scale thing it starts by just going up the C major scale and we're gonna double the notes and this is gonna lead into a piece at the end so that's doubles then you try it triples this will make you pick back and forth up and down and it'll change each direction down up down up down up I can't even say that again so you're crippled by changing directions you're really learning how to pick so double double double now here come the triplets [Music] now fours then at the very end just play a scale the idea being that you alternate over and over and over if you find yourself doubling you'll notice that it'll really slow you down so what you want to do is go slow enough so you're always going down in some rare occasions you'll want to double it and a melody for a different string but mostly the down up alternating picking is going to give you the most out of that so once you've done that exercise a bunch of times and you get used to that we're gonna go towards a little piece called my hero and this one gives an a7 [Music] you can see this is a little bit involved but if you go really slow in seven and we're gonna go over in the key of D minor using V minor chord and you just play the last scale a [Music] little bit of a tongue twister there the second part goes to a G minor and then that's the whole thing the thing you want to do is go really really slow with this stuff and get every node and then exercises a little tongue twister in at the end that's meant to make you pick backwards and forwards so you might want to save that one for a little while until you get some technique going but that's basically it a bunch of exercises remember to hold the pick in a way that feels really comfortable use your wrist to do all the work and then just play until you start feeling comfortable it takes a while and I suggest the scales and the arpeggios over and over and over and go back and forth between until you really get a feel for it when you're strumming it's a little different it's when your wrist needs just let it go so go after it and see how it feels and joint your lesson", "09ZHfVTv_Ls": "[Music] okay so today I'm gonna be doing a real quick oil change on my 2009 or sorry 2009 my 2012 r1 this will work on anything from 2009 to current r1 basically this procedure but I follow the same process for every bike that I do so our vehicle really the oil that I use is the 10 W 40 amsoil and I also use their EA om 103 filter black they also offer it and a chrome but it sees a black because we're mines located on this bike that you'll see here in a little bit it wouldn't make much sense to do chrome I could be able to see it anyway so the tools you're gonna need is you're going to need the oil filter socket is what I call it this is just an amp Pro that I picked up at I think O'Reilly Auto Parts they had them basically what you want to do is you want to take in or grab your oil filter walk in with it make sure it fits I can't remember the specific size for this so apologize I might put it in the description if I find out what it is what you'll also need is a 17 millimeter socket that's for the drain plug you'll need a few extensions a ratchet and then you'll also need a four millimeter allen key or an Allen wrench basically I have a key set its metric and I also have on that standard makes it really nice when you're working on these bikes just because there's so many different sizes and typically the Yamahas are completely metric actually I'd be surprised you found one standard bolt on it and then you'll also need the key to your bike I start my bike up and I warm it up for about five ten minutes or so so it gets about to the 200 mark and holds consistent I also tried to feel the side of the clutch cover once that starts to get pretty hot and then I understand that but what oils getting warm because your bike could be at 200 degrees Fahrenheit by the doesn't mean the oils warm so one thing I want to make sure is that the oil is getting up to temperature basically if you've ever used our ever had syrup before one cold syrup versus warm syrup you can tell the difference of viscosity the cold start should be a lot thicker than the warm syrup so oil is going to work the same way warmer oils can be a little bit more thinner it's going to bring out more of the contaminants and everything else it's something oil when it's warm because it actually gets to move through the motor it's sort of moving that stuff around again and then it'll drop it down into your oil pan or your catch pan which is another thing that you're gonna need this is just a small one that I have so yeah there's not a lot to it I recommend anyone doing this themselves because the dealer's going to charge you a lot of money to get this done in comparison to what you could spend doing it yourself you know do it yourself buy higher quality oil a lot of guys around the Castro Castro stuff some guys roaming the running the Mobil 140 I've ran that for a while but I switched over to hams oil if you use Furies a few years ago and that's the way to go for me honestly ships a lot smoother runs a lot nicer from what I can from what I can tell and it's quality stuff they've done the research you can see all the oil studies and everything else independent studies and they're up there as you know number one number two most of the time so anyways I'm going to get into here be back with you in a second [Music] okay so I'm gonna call that good [Music] basically my field test is always done by the oil level if I can lay my hand up against that and it gets pretty warm to me that's that's good means the oil is nice and liquid like more thin than what it would be if it was cold so basically the first step is going to be to remove the lower left and right fairings basically there's really one two three four five eight bolts holding that on you've got one two three you got that on the other side as well and then you've got the two one there and one there you're gonna remove this these lower pieces and there's a trick to removing these two and I'll get to that here in a second they kind of slight and so you can get it in there that's all the pieces that you're going to need to remove on this bike to be able to get get the oil change done correctly once I get all these loosened up I'll come back and I'll show you guys the trick to kind of sliding those in and out because there's a bracket right in here that it slides into so I'll be back in one second okay so I just removed the left side of the bike which left me at the right side as you can kind of see there so I've got these two up here loose you gotta listen up that bottom one there so go ahead and do that here real quick and that's it they're quick release and quarter turn stuff pretty simple so like I was saying with this bracket there's a special way of getting this out you just don't yank it straight back you've literally got to take the panel and watch it'll slide down just like that it's got like a slotted bracket I'll show you that here in a second that's all you got to do to loosen up that panel but one thing you want to make sure you do is you want to remove this top portion first it's got these little tabs on it that kind of right so the gloss panels got little tabs that actually go into the tabs on this lower panel so like I said you slide this thing forward and then it will come right out of that bracket so you hold onto this panel here and show it to you you can see how the right side this is gonna focus now I might be about as good as it'll get some reason why auto focus is going all over the place but you can see how the right side of this bracket has a bigger opening than the left so basically when you put it in you'll slide it this way when you take it out you'll slide it that way and like I said that is all you've got to do to remove everything you need to get to do the oil change so you've got one trick I've kind of learned too is that if you buy om panels over to ever in your lifetime it's gonna come in this really nice wrapper I hold on to it because the insides got like a microfiber feel and eights I'm working on the bike I will throw my panels on on that so they don't get scratched or whatever I did here one bullet come bouncing off this way so I'm gonna grab this sometimes they will actually pop out of the panel that you're working on so instead of over here by the panel so I don't lose it okay so next step is going to be to remove the drain plug which is on the left side of the bike if you're sitting on it right side if you're looking at it and it is this bowl right there and it's a 17 millimeter so I'm gonna grab my drain pan grab my ratchet and loosen it up here so I'll be right back okay so I've gotten it loosened up with my ratchet which by the way I want to mention this is probably my favorite ratchet because it's got basically built an extension to pull down this little collar here and it'll extend out pretty nice it comes in I mean give me begin to explain how many times this has saved me so anyways I took my 17 millimeter socket I am loosening up the drain plug now be careful you have a catch pan that's got a big hole you don't want your train plug or your drain bolt your drain plugs actually go into it that would be that would suck ceed up tear open it tear it open and get into it so anyways they're not all the oil is draining I'm setting plug to the side one thing I always do is I try to throw something down I'm pretty good at changing the oil bit because you can see there you know there's a couple drops I always try to put something down to catch the accidents so I'm gonna let this drain you can see it's pretty pretty clean [Music] looks really good I always like to run my fingers through it a little bit see if I can feel any grit anything like that you know any excess stuff you know these cell magnetic drain plugs I just haven't gotten around to so I will probably pick one up in the future maybe not I don't know we'll see but looks good I don't seeing any like major fibers or anything like that so that's a good thing I'm gonna let this drain for a little bit here I'm not gonna get too anal about it yet because what I'm gonna do is I want to put that plug back in into the drain hole so that I can read so I can move this without oil getting everywhere and then I'm actually going to loosen up the oil filter to relieve some pressure in the system and that's going to drain oil into this too as well then when I'm done I'm gonna come back and loosen up this again and let the excess oil drain it allow it to collect and because there's a pressurized system whether you want to believe it or not because it's closed system so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to like I said remove the oil filter which will allow another place for air to escape then it will let more oil drain into the pan and get more bad stuff out of there so I'm gonna put this drain plug back in also be careful if you do this and your oil is really hot in my end gets a couple second third-degree burns on your hands mine's high but it's nothing I can't stand which is good it's like the perfect time to be honest with you okay so that's back in I'm gonna get to the oil filter and I'll be back with you guys in a second okay so now it is time to actually take off the filter basically the filter on the are want is then the header in between the headers there crap see if I can get a good shot of a [Music] [Applause] you can kind of see it through there you can see the actual : pump and then you can see the oil filter right there so what I do is I work on the left side of the bike so clutch side of the bike or a clutch it be actually be the brake side of the bike if you're looking at the levers clutch side clutch cover side of the bike so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna fish actually put this on the oil filter itself with my hand through the side of the bike through that gap right there and then once I get this on I'm gonna take these extensions fish them through the header like that and get on the actual oil filter and then be able to pushed it off I guess really can't remember if I do this with the front stand on this bike or not I might have to take the front stand down and turn the wheel to be able to get the extension in there but we'll find out I'm gonna get to that here in a second once I get that on I will be back okay so I've got the oil filter wrench on or socket on you can see there at the extension coming off right there and there's the extension the extension comes through the headers there and then what I'll do is I'll take my ratchet put it on the end of it loosen it up now I have some plastic wrap that I get for free but it's relatively cheap anywhere you go but I usually lay that down along the header because that's literally that oil filter is literally gonna drain right in here right on top of the header it's not gonna hurt anything if you don't put anything there it'll just smoke like crazy probably for the first 15 minutes after you start it up till all that oil burns off which isn't gonna hurt anything it's a titanium header I mean it's gonna stay in it on the top and nothing that you're ever gonna see so completely up to you whether you want to use this trick or not so like I said I'm gonna loosen that up here and then yeah we are back okay so I have gotten the oil filter loosened up its drain it's good to go get ready to pull it off now most with filters sockets that I have found it's a really really tight fit let's just me let me put it that but it's a really tight fit to get the oil filter out of the headers so I always take the oil filter socket off once it's loose because these have a way of getting jammed on the oil filter and if you pull it off you have no leverage to yank it off I mean there's not a lot of room to get your hand in there so I make sure it's a hinge it's loose enough to where I can twist it with my hand and then I pull this off of the oil filter itself once that's off the oil filter then I'm able to again see if I can do this holding the camera somehow okay so you have to hold this with a towel is manager got oil on it but so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to reach in here finish it off with my hand as bad as that sound it's no pun intended okay and then take it and then wiggle it out through this gap right here which it fits out perfectly through and then there's gonna be a little excess and I you know dump it out now one thing to keep in mind is that this stage is extremely hot for a long time because it was cooling in there the coolant stays really really really really warm so if you warm up your bike and you do this quickly like it should be I can and you go in here you let your hand against it there's a good chance you might burn your hand right there so be careful okay next is putting the oil filter new oil filter on and I'll get to prepping that here in a second okay so we've got the old filter out which is right here new filter here basically what I do before I put it on as I put a nice ring coating of oil around the gasket that's on the outside keeps it from getting dry rotted all that good stuff most oil filters that go in in a vertical situation and I will pre-fill all the way pretty much to the top if I could get it in and out it's spilling but since this filter literally goes in like this I can only pre-fill it so much so I pre fill it you know just a hair it's better than nothing and then what I do is I kind of roll the filter around so that the fibers can soak it up so I just roll it around a little bit you can see looking into it there's almost nothing in there now but I did fill it up pretty good so that helps with the dry start a little bit best I can do so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna take this back over to the bike and then fish it in same way I took it out literally with the back side facing me and then go in you're gonna turn it at a 90 pretty much right after the silver pump and then hand tighten it on some people like to start backwards but I've gotten so used to that I can start in a forward way just very very carefully turn it then once it engages I can start turning it on so I'm gonna get the oil filter put on I'm gonna tighten it down I've gotten to the points where I can just feel I don't need a torque wrench to do it I think it's like 14 Newton meters or something like that to be able to tighten this down to the torque spec but I've gotten good enough to where I can just hand tighten it know where it needs to be and I'm good to go and this is like I said the OE or this is the AMSOIL oil filter so I'm gonna get this put on and I'll be back and show you the drain process again okay so the oil filter is back on and kind of seeped in there now I'm going back to that drain plug I told you about now I'm going to loosen this up again get back a little bit [Music] and well more oil to come out so that was close so again it's not much of a difference but it's how I was taught you know so it's what I do so I'm gonna let that drain there for a while I'm also going to open up the fill cap here and take some of my new oil because this bike calls for like 4.1 five quarts so I'm gonna take some of the court over there the new oil and pull it into the clutch port in the clutch cover while it's still draining to kind of flush out the oil in as well you can see up there I've got a collection of bottles eleven with oil stuff I've actually got a couple of quarts here so I mean I could use those might try to date everything that I buy I know that I'm gonna be using the most of this one here soon on another guy's bike so I'm just going to use that bottle instead and keep my older stuff over there so yeah I'm going to start pouring that now and then I'll be back okay so I'm back and I pour it in some of the fresh oil with the drain plug open so you can kind of see it coming out here in the clean oil you can't really see it but I can see it to my hi kinda looks like a tornado clean and dirty oil it's kind of cool when it comes out wants a color but it kind of just like I said flushes out the system I probably poured in an eighth of a quart just enough to you know push more oil out more dirty oil out again this is what the oil filter put on the fill cap open and then the drain plug out for new oil in and that's basically the concept that I'm working on there so once this is done draining for the most part goes to a trip I'm gonna put the plug back in and then I will be back okay so the oil turned into a drip and then what I did is I went ahead and put the drain plug back in I'm taking my 17 millimeter socket and making sure righty tighty lefty loosey so going the right way there put it on the socket on the on the nut on the bolt excuse me and then tighten it down I think the torque spec on this is like 45 newton meters again I've gotten I've done so many bikes and cars that I can't even count so I'm just I'm I just tightened it down to the until I I think it's good so which is right there you don't to go too tight because if you bust off this nut or you strip out the threads or post-op this nun if you strip off the threads or whatever you need a new oil pan those can get expensive granted it's probably one of the easier ones to change but it can get expensive so the one I've done what I like to do is I like to grab just a dirty shop towel wipe off the oil pan any excess oil around the bowl itself the head or anything to kind of clean it up a little bit because it gets kind of grimy down here and I'm pretty anal about my bike so I like to make it look as clean as possible so I get in here and I wipe it down and everything else so now it's the filling now before you fill you have to make sure that your oil filter is on and your drain plugs in and otherwise you'll just be wasting your money by dumping oil in and watching you go out the other end so this bike takes like I said four point one five quarts or so so I'm gonna put it in a solid four out of my gallon and see where I'm at because I prefilled the filter a little bit so we're gonna go ahead and do that now and when I'm back all kind of show you the oil level basically also I wanted to say that I've got a bunch of different oil funnels I've got one for clean oil I've got one for dirty oil I've got another one for brake fluid and then I've got another one for cooling so it keeps me from having to clean out my filter my hope my funnels and they're like 99 cents a piece so I just bought a bunch of them it keeps me from having to clean them out I keep them separate and all that good stuff so I guess that's a little tip for anyone that's constant banging out filters scroll pay five bucks and get enough to do everything that you're gonna need to do so all right I'm going to fill it right here with the funnel nice thing about these little funnels is they well this one doesn't but they sit in there pretty nice they fit in the hole perfectly and then what I'm gonna do is since I have the camera I'm gonna have to turn off the camera but I'm gonna hold it up with one hand fill it up with the other I'm gonna use pretty much the whole gallon so I'm gonna head and do that here and my back okay so the oil has been put in like I said I use the whole gallon here didn't mean to kick it over but use the whole gallon put the cap back on top of this court here and hold on to left over for buddy's bike and there we go so next step is going to be to start the bike let it warm up and then I'm gonna check my oil level no there are two marks on the site glass down here please focus camera that's pretty good there's a mark here and a mark here the goal is to shoot to be right between it I personally like to go on the high side I've had my oil light come on before under hard acceleration when I was right in the middle so I try to put it on the higher side so then the glass is half-full there's actually a tick mark right in the middle I like to be just above that so some guys will just go right in the middle I like to go on the higher side so see if I can zoom in on it here so you can see the little tick mark in the middle so lower line upper line middle so that's kind of what I like to go for but like I said let's start the bike here and then let it run [Music] so gonna let it run for 5-10 minutes or so double check my oil level we step out of here so you can actually hear me so let it run for five or ten minutes or so double check the oil and then good to go I'll show the oil level once I'm done okay so I ran the bike for about 5-10 minutes give me time to clean up pick up put all the panels back on again down there on the bottom and everything else so but give you an idea of where I keep my Louisville so as you can see it's about just half way just over half way so that's where I keep my level and yeah that's all there is to changing oil on a onine to current are one also what I like to do is get some quick detailer when I'm done and spray down the panel's at my oil hand so our oil the hands were on in any other place I still have to touch there there an oil cap and everything else but I like to clean up all the excess oil and the different panels and whatnot so if you have any questions let me know again I use the cams oil filter and oil 10 W 40 full synthetic motorcycle oil which is a wet clutch compatible so find an oil you like and do it yourself save you a bunch of money save you time and yeah any questions let me know thanks guys see it [Music]", "GnlVm1gsO8g": "hey guys welcome to your favorite show messy garage today we're gonna kick off our new series broken ranch by changing oil to a 2015 r1 alright first up get a drain the oil in ten hours now it's draining second step remove the fairing to get to the oil filter taking the old filter outs now we're going to prep the new filter by putting some oil in and kind of put some around the ring before we put it back now I'm putting the new filter in trying to tighten up a little bit I'll have to use my old I am I have my own new filter in I went ahead and put back the oil plug before I put in money oil and now carefully we to pour in the new oil into the engine before you pull your oil prep you cans and make sure they're open because you don't want to spend time opening the cans while you've burned the oil but wait there's more now the oil is done time to adjust the chain for your change you should really have about an inch an inch and a half of travel the first thing you want to do you want to loosen those two bolts and I recommend doing one rotation this side then go to the other side and do another row tation so here I'm going to the other side and I'm actually matching the same number of rotations and when you're done the tension and your chance should be good then finally you make sure that you test in the big nut I have a torque ranch so I know exactly how much torque should apply to this Oh before I forget one of the viewer left a comment to watch the bike a little bit sorry can do we can only do mechanic work this is not a car wash Thanks can you believe this after all this work I can ride it's frickin raining outside thanks for watching make sure you subscribe", "9E7M_FM3gPY": "okay today I'm going to demonstrate how to properly put on an oil pan the non shade-tree way look at all of this first thing you do is scrape all the trash off of the oil pan see all that crap that was all the excess sealant that wasn't even supposed to be there that was either in the oil pan in the bolt holes or squeezing out between the case and the oil pan and needless to say it was in the oil pump pickup screen too so now that all that stuff is gone what I have to do next is all of the bolts are plastered in sealant so I will have to now run them through a die [Music] a few times clean all that excess unnecessary inappropriately used sealing times like 14 okay the hardest part about putting the little pack back on is shelling out the money for a ten dollar gap you here's how you do it take a knife you cut the bag open you carefully remove this nice brand new Yamaha gasket you take your oil pan that is now clean and all the gasket material scraped off you place the gasket on it onto the correctly installed dowel pin now hope you don't have a problem I use white rags in my shop you have the appropriate holes with the oil OOP in place place the oil pan correctly where it should go once it's seated flush against the cake put any bolts I'm just putting two in I'm turning them up to where they just contact the cake to hold the oil planning hand in play another hard part about doing a job like this is having the right tools so after you get all your bolts in you properly torque it with a four inch using the appropriate crisscross for caddy and I'll continue on around with the rest of my bolt better than that shell that's the way to do it notice I didn't use any sealant on there because you're not supposed to they're designed to go on dry with no ceiling now there are exceptions some Honda's use no gaskets on their case covers there is an exception there you don't use get because they don't make them and there's places where your cases come together and split under a cover like this", "C5ix_J8IFZs": "so what did he is everybody thanks for tuning back in here to another episode here on the speed bug Channel we got the r1 in here behind me on the stand and y'all seen the title first service and you know break-in oil that's got to come out so we're pretty much gonna do an oil change as well I'll check the chain tension now I have kept an eye on it's just so you guys know as well because I have ridden it and let's see it with my foot it's not too loose but it's not too tight for the ones I did see let me get one more time so it's still actually cutting pretty much good within spec so I don't really have to adjust it just yet but I'm sure after a few more jumps and pulls we will have to adjust it but primarily it will go over the bike check all the nuts and bolts nooks and crannies you know get all in-between it you know toes and feet and fingers and all that and make sure everything is still on the up-and-up with the r1m as an update for you guys if anyone's wondering so far absolutely zero issues with the bike since I've had it so far as well since it has been flashed still no issues or anything like that everything works perfectly fine flawless as expected and everything from blaze cycle and of course like I said you know I'm not a fan of the Yamaha brand but they knocked it out with the Gen 2 version of this series of this motorcycle so let's get rolling let's get this bike jacked up and we got to get the left fairing off here so that we can get to the oil filter and get to the bottom and as well as drain all the oil so let's get this thing going and let's get it rolling [Music] [Music] now that we have the fairing off motorcycles we can expose the bike with the oil filter and obviously the drain plug here we have the oil filter and you can give in so many tight place that's great but anyway so we'll go ahead and get the oil filter drained out get a little piece of cardboard or something here so it doesn't drip all over the header and then I was to get our drain pan and get that going ahead and drained out all the motor oil thing uses 1040 obviously they want you to use Yama loop but again it's oil choice you should be an owner's choice as far as preference again I personally use Mobil 1 as you see my big banner here Mobil 1 no I'm not sponsored or anything by them but I run that in all my vehicles and everything works great you know as I said they have their own form of the one team race teams and many other things and I've ran it and tests of well exceeded anything that of course that I'm going to be utilizing and doing with my bike so I haven't had anything blow up yet but again if you want to use yama lube or royal purple or Pennzoil or anything like that just make sure it meets the recommendations and the minimum specifications to your bike and you obviously shouldn't have an issue but again I use mobile one so I'm gonna go ahead and put Mobil one back in it and I went ahead and an OEM oil filter just ordered that from you know the Yamaha site and headed to the door so usually your dream plug itself is magnetic and I can show you that right here here's your drain plug and if there are some metal shavings and some clutch dust and stuff like that remember it's the first time the bike has been fired and now you're riding it whether you're riding it hard soft whatever it's gonna have some in there but it definitely shouldn't be any chunks or anything like that if it does have some chunks or anything like that you need to take that back to the dealer and definitely probably read demanding a new bike because you're gonna have some serious problems down the road or you are we already have some serious problems but you're gonna have some more serious ones out yeah some more serious ones obviously down the road so I'll go ahead and let this drain then obviously we'll cap that back up wipe everything down get the oil filter off install that and then top this thing off with oil I think it uses 4.1 yeah 4.1 with no filter change 4.3 again always you know I obviously and you clearly can't drain the oil cooler in the oil cooler line so it's probably right around the four quart range but also double check when you're filling it up on the iSight window you do have to start the bike and have the bike run because it has to obviously pump through and cycle through and get all the oil everywhere that it's going to needs of you because you don't want this thing to not have enough oil and then you can burn it up that's not good so we'll go ahead and let this drain here for a few more minutes cap this sucker back up and get the oil filter off and throw the new one on [Music] tip in the middle here we go so as we have this one things you could see how chewed up I had to grab that with the players's that's the only tool I had here that would fit this oil filter itself I didn't have my oil filter wrench for that correct size but how tight I had to grab that with my pliers to get it off now the dealer did that and not the deal excuse me the manufacturer did that when it was installed there's no need to tighten the  out of this thing so tight there's a rubber seal on the inside of this that black rubber seal right there it will automatically seal it with the heat of the motorcycle you put a couple of dabs if oil on it around it with your finger around the rim and you throw it on there just obviously make sure that that surface is clean same thing that goes with the drain plug no needs excuse me tighten it down completely or an int or go crazy you know 10 15 foot-pounds of torque at max that's it you don't want to strip it out or anything like that because the heat the bike is going to expand and contract with the heat as the oil and the bike gets hot so again rule of thumb that I always do with oil filters it doesn't matter what car or motorcycle it is if it's this type of oil filter thread it on by hand first until it stops and then give it a good 3/4 to one full turn after it's tight and then that sucker will be sealed after that it'll come off then you'll usually don't need a wrench or anything like that you can take it off by hand and then you're gonna be good but anything after that it's over killing you're just making it a more of a pain in your ass just like this to get this sucker off but now that this side is done we'll go ahead and spray everything down with some brake cleaner clean everything up reinstall the fairings and let's dump some fresh oil in this job [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so we're gonna throw this boil in there no talking I'm gonna make it really weird for all of you viewers the tens of 21,000 people watching it's me I'm dumping this boiling because my neighbor came over and he wanted me to talk and see my production you can't see it be behind the camera but again like I mentioned four ports 4.3 changing the filter and once we get to the fourth part we'll take a peek at the sight glass on the other side of the bike and we'll see exactly where it is and we'll start the bike and see how it goes all right and now we'll let the oil drip down from the top of the cylinder head now that the oil pump has pumped it through and we'll check our sight glass and you can see it's already starting to fill up a little bit but we'll check it here in another minute and we'll see exactly if it's full if it's not full within the two scratched lines in there then you'll just push obviously put a dump a little bit more oil into the side of the crankcase and that will wrap it up here for the 600-mile service here on the bike because I mentioned before in the beginning of the video of course I already did the chain tension obviously check the links obviously in the back of the swimmer so everything is good like that but if that chain is definitely going to need to be tightened up here coming up here very shortly so I've obviously checked the oil everything's good it's spot-on and that's gonna wrap up here for today's episode again if you guys like what you saw don't forget to subscribe Facebook Instagram and had the speed book obviously same name here as YouTube and we will check you all for another episode here on the Speed blog channel deuces guys", "wTTrY9v6E_8": "what is that my friend welcome once again to another video in this video I will be teaching you how to change your coolant on a 2009 to 2014 Yamaha r1 step-by-step I'm gonna teach you guys how to do this very simple nothing to it I will be doing a complete flush what that means is I'll be putting distilled water to take out all that excess from the coolant from inside the bike a lot of people don't do it but I like to do that because you know you know I have to take out all the dirtiness that it's been holding there for months like I said I'm gonna use distilled water just regular distilled water I mean you can use a better brand I got this and my last review of changing my coolant I changed my Raptor say 100 you guys wanna check that out video that but I used Yama cool in this video I will be using engine ice yes but the reason why I'm gonna use engine ice today is because these bikes do run hotter engines than a motorcycle or regular ATV does of course bigger engine it's more hot that's the reason one that use ninja 9 so I'm gonna give it a try let you guys know how good it is step number one come to the left side of your bike you're gonna remove the lower end the lower fairing which says Yamaha right there that's we're gonna remove remove one two three bolts in the bottom where it says Yamaha that's the gonna bottom fairing first also there's two more screws right here on the side you're gonna remove those two that way the whole thing you come off alright step number two you're gonna remove the reservoir cap right here you remove this little cap and behind it it's the reservoir watch it you see little has the little washers right here look I just noticed that alright step number four you come to the right side of your bike and remove one two three four bolts on the upper fairing side [Music] after you remove those those bolts on top now you come to the bottom and you remove these bolts right here in a fairing just watch your Witcher when you do this just watch your wittle hardness just make sure you unplug it from the top and take it down after removing the fare you can see the radiator cap filling right there all you gotta do is remove these that you took off right now the little bolts remove that from the top be careful with this middle one because it's kind of tricky pop that to the side it'll probably come out pretty easy wow that one was hard to take off alright by the way that was step number five remove all this that's the number five locate that thing right there number six just remove the cap the filler cap right here there it is I'm just gonna put it right here for now I always remember guys you do not want to do this while your engine is hot you want to do is when it's cold I'm not even started the bike I woke up this morning and I'm doing this right now do not I repeat do not open this up when the freaking bike is hot it will blow up in your face and it will not be good step number seven you come again to the left side of your bike locate your reservoir right here is gonna be a 10 millimeter socket it's gonna be one bolt and it's gonna be another bolt I believe back here way back here you see it hiding back there you can possibly pull this hoses this way for now that way you have reached to it and right now when you're finished just put them back where they were still number a you just remove it after you remove the bolts remove it see mine is empty doesn't have anything at all has a little bit of in there so I'm just gonna I got this little thing right here I'm gonna just clean it I'm gonna put some water in it and clean it try stir it pretty good and then step number nine after you wash and clean your reservoir right under it it's the drain bolt that's gonna be in between these this bowl right here and this bolt right here it's this one right here in the middle you see it right there and I thought I had a pan a smaller pan so I'm using my trucks pen right now it looks all but at least I'm not gonna drop it in the floor by the way it's the same ten millimeter socket the one you're gonna use for the coolant drain bolt Oh step number ten after you're done draining the coolant everything's done come back to the right side of your bike put the funnel inside the coolant tap and then fill it up this is what this is how you're flushing the the dirt from inside the bike this is the way to do it right here step number eleven you come back to the left side of your bike located getting your bolt put it back in there number 12 you reinstall your reservoir back into the bike do that with the Jose because of course you're gonna refill it alright step number 13 you come back to your right side of your bike locate the cooling radiator go ahead and fill it up all the way to the top see that's the way it should look yes and see it you can barely see it in there moving just that's how you should be fool all the way to the top we can go ahead and put your cap back on after it's fill all the way to the top step number 15 come all the way back to the left side of your bike and refill the reservoir all the way to the full line guys remember has a little full line right here in the side I'll try I'll show you ran out of it see the full line right there I passed a little bit but it's fine they don't matter nothing will harm me if you pass a little line now go ahead and put your hose back in now go ahead and put your cap back on just like so all right number 16 are you gonna do is chin on your bike and let it run till the fan kicks in alright last step I step number 17 F to turn off your bike check for leakage is under right there by the bolt there's no leak just coming you're good on that side you can see it's not dripping anything at all so now you're totally good after that just go ahead and put your bearings back on and you're done I hope you liked the video I do this video for fun for knowing the reason I'd like to show the people that you can do it yourself you know what a hundred dollars do a freaking cool chain meeting for yourself I'm save a little money I turn from being a video that's how I do my stuff - I just know not a mechanic I don't know how to do all these things that just randomly no I I see and then I make a video to show you guys so you can do it on yourself if you didn't like the video please give a big thumbs up like I said it takes me a while to do this stuff but a man I love making this video so more videos to come suspect for more and as always guys the nice day", "Bj8Iv0jydKk": "hey guys and welcome back to episode three of the basket case r1 rebuild um so today i'm going to be finishing up the bottom of the engine here mostly the oil system and probably going into some of the clutch area so the first thing that goes in in the case here is going to be the oil pump and water pump it's the same thing there's an o-ring right here so make sure you have that lubricated before you put it in so the oil pump itself just kind of slides in to that hole right there on the o-ring sometimes it's easier okay so then there's going to be two bolts and a pin so the first thing i'm going to do is go ahead and put the pin in and that's going to go in this side right here so you have to wiggle it a little bit to get it all the way seated in there just to go all the way down there it goes once then the oil pump will kind of quit moving around okay then there's gonna be two bolts one right there and one right there both are going to be loctited and then torque down to 12 newton meters and i'm gonna go ahead and install the other bolt and it's also lock tighten and guys if you build engines a lot this is the best thing i've ever used the new brushless milwaukee fuel m12 90 degree impact it has a soft start and remove function and it just makes building engines great okay i'm going to torque those down to 12 newton meters so now that's installed so the next thing i'm going to install is the the oil relief valve right here it's pretty easy to install i'm just going to put some oil on the o-ring here a new o-ring of course and then just slides in right there that easy the next one i'll put is an oil transfer pipe it's going to go from here to here so just like that one i'm going to put some oil on those o-rings there it goes that way it slides in right there these are also going to be loctited so i'm going to go ahead and put those in now next i'll put this um drain back in it's going to go just right straight down in here there's a little hole going to be down in there not sure if you can see that one moment okay i'm not sure if you can see that right there but there's a little hole down in there right there so the bottom of this pipe is going to slip into that hole there just like right there and the top is going to bolt on right here at the top okay then this one will also have two loctite bolts installed here or one sorry [Music] that's also going to be torqued down to 10 foot pounds our newton meters 10 newton meters there we go okay [Music] then this is gonna be the oil um or water pump weep hole so if there's any leakage pest pump it goes out of the case instead of the engine that's gonna go right there [Music] and the last we're gonna have the oil pick up here um it also has a new o-ring there and it's gonna go just right in here and it's gonna have three bolts in it which of course are going to be lactated so i'll start with these two back ones first okay then there'll also be one in the front there [Music] these will also be torqued down to 10 newton meters [Music] all right on the front of the engine there's going to be one more oil drain pipe so i'm going to go ahead and install that now so i'm going to put a bit of oil on that o-rings here on this piece and it's going to slide in just right here just like that yep then i'll put some loctite on these too because why not [Music] then these will also be torqued down to 10 newton meters while i'm here i'll also go ahead and reinstall the plug that goes right here i'm not sure what the actual torque spec is on these um it's not much though so definitely don't over torque them if you do have them out these also have new o-rings [Music] [Applause] next i'm going to go ahead and install the um coolant outlet here that goes into the front of the engine just like the rest that have an o-ring here a new o-ring i'm going to go ahead and put some oil on it to help them go in it's just going to go right in there and again another lock top this is going to be torqued down to 10 newton meters as well [Music] then i'm going to put the chain in here checking to make sure there's no damage on it of course i don't see anything no scarring everything looks good on this one i'm just going to lower it down in here i'll put it over the crank uh counter shaft first and then i'll put it around the sprocket here there we go okay so now i'm going to go ahead and put the oil pan on i'm actually missing the dowel right now so i'm going to come back and put that on in later but i'm going to go ahead and put it on just so i can turn the engine over to work on the other side all right so the dow pin would go there and there they're just two small dowels and bring the whole pan in so one thing you got to watch for is to make sure you don't pull that um drain incorrectly into the hole [Music] also some of these bolts get locked out on them um but i'm not going to do that right now because i'm taking it back off course like i said [Music] and then just like the rest these are going to be torqued down to 10 newton meters oh sorry it's 12 newton meters so 12 newton meters i'm talking these down two [Music] okay so the whole pan's on there so now we can flip the motor over okay so the last thing i'm install here on the lower end pretty much is the oil cooler here first i'll go ahead and just get that on there it's a lot easier to do this has a big o-ring and i also already got some oil on it use your torque down to 63 newton meters okay so now i'm going to start putting some of the uh transmission parts in basically uh there's a couple of these little small plates that go down in here so this one's gonna go right here on that spring route that down to 10 newton meters course [Music] then there'll be another plate on this side here as well so then we'll go ahead and lock that and install these permanently they're just sitting in there [Music] these also be torqued down to 10 newton meters okay next i'm going to put these back in here um in this plate make sure you've got it on there one thing to know make sure you put that on before the chain or it can be kind of hard to you have to take the chain back off [Music] these will be torqued down to 12 newton meters [Music] okay you", "Ug18gvaCtfQ": "welcome to another edition of r1 videos comm we are changing the oil on a 2004 Yamaha r1 now I'm going to put some dams oil full synthetic motor oil in this guy specially formulated for motorcycle got our Jasso ma ratings here you don't want to put any oil in your AR one that doesn't have a Jaso ma rating car oils don't cut it don't do it also going to be installing a flow stainless steel reusable oil filter I never have to buy another oil filter and this guy flows better than the the paper filter the bike comes with so we'll be installing that today as well we're going to start popping off the lower fairing we're going to take off Zeus fastener here here here at the rear and then one right here at the front for this side and then this guy right down here is an actual screw that comes out I'm going to pop these off with just a quick little quarter turn that loosens them up right here but kind of hidden back there a little bit not too hard to get to the rear and we're gonna pull this one out right here give you everything a little shake make sure it's off the other side we're going to be doing the same Zeus fastener here here here at the front right there one at the rear and then actual screw here at the bottom there's no particular order a quarter turned all the Zeus fasteners giving everything a little bit of a wiggle to make sure it's going to come apart I'm taking out the last screed down here spin this guy out this should drop right down to the you can see why that towel is here roll it forward alright you're going to need a 17 millimeter opening bucks in wrench to get your oil drain plug out of there it has just got right up here crank spin that out this is a real good time to go get a beer make a sandwich whatever you want to do with it have your chick make a sandwich you don't want to rush this let let as much the oil come out of that bike as you can while that's draining we're also going to pull the oil filter which is right here behind this water line I don't have a proper oil filter wrench which you can buy at any motorcycle shop for about 15 bucks they're kind of hard to get in here especially with a socket driver on it so I use Oh blue channel locks these work great just kind of get up in here behind pipe or on top of it give it just a little bit of a nudge to break it loose and then you can just get it loose by hand spin it off by hand and then again we're just going to let the oil drain it takes more than ten minutes for all the oil to come out of your bike also this bike was was run recently but has been sitting for probably fifteen or twenty minutes so it's cool enough now that we can touch all this up in here you definitely don't want to do this when the engines hot or the exhaust is hot you get to burn yourself and get some really cool scars so just let the bike cool down a little bit before you change the oil so you can see the drain has slowed down considerably here it with the bike on the stand in the upright position I'm going to put the kickstand down and take the bike off of the stand and let the rest of the oil drain out most shops are going to keep your bike in a straight up-and-down position when they change the oil so everything you just saw come out of there is still in your engine when they pour clean oil on top of it so doing it yourself will save you some money plus you know all your old oils out of your bike okay so this is the this is the stock drain plug it came out of there and the crush washer that's on it which is just a little aluminum that you're really should replace every time you do an oil change little crush washer cost about a buck fifty don't be cheap and not replace that you will regret it so this is your stock drain plug we're going to reinstall a drain plug with a magnet on it this little magnet will catch any metal particles that get down into the oil pan before they get sucked up these retail anywhere from about $9.99 to $24.99 depending on if it's titanium aluminum or steel you can find them at any any reputable bike shop we are going to put a aluminum crush washer on there a little more longevity to this one than to the old one can reuse this four or five times whereas the the old style you use you couldn't reuse it it was a one-time use still eventually we'll have to replace this this one you have to replace every time okay so real quick we're going to wipe off our surfaces here and reinstall our drain plug and our crush washer right here all right we are torquing our drain plug bolt down to 31 foot-pounds we're going to clean that the surface where your oil filter mates to your engine just get a little wipe down in there make sure it's nice and clean before we put the new filter on smeared on the seal we've got the oil filter on spin on about hand tight whatever it takes to get in and just give a good prank you don't want to you don't want to tighten that with any type of wrench just hand tight as tight as you can get it and I'll suffice and we're ready to put a oil back in this bike almost ready to start it up you have all the tools you need to change the oil in your tool kit under the seat but tool kits or when you're broke down on the side road and don't have anything else to use we're going to use our opening box end wrench slide right in here give a little twist alright so basically you're going to put in about three quarts and then start watching the window normally it'll take about three point 3 to 3.5 quart soil but I'll usually do about three and then just check that window right now we're at about halfway I'm going to overfill it a little bit because when we start and run this engine it's going to distribute the oil through the engine and bring that level down so we're going to we're going to take it from here and put it just to the top of the window we're going to loosely put the cap back on and run the bike for a couple of minutes and then check the oil level again also while you're running the bike on the stand look for any oil leaks at your drain plug or your oil filter about a hundred and fifty people shutting down and check your level again we got no oil on the window all the oil was at the bottom of the engine we drained it all out now all that has been redistributed through the engine you know in the filter in the lines the top of the top of the head so yeah we're just going to top it off alright so we've taken the bike off the stand it is now on the side stand you want to check the oil with the front and the rear wheels on the ground can't really get an accurate oil reading with it on the stand so we put it put it on the ground and then stand the bike straight up and we're right at the top mark right where we want to be we're going to put the cap on reinstall the fairings and go ride or drink beer you you label that out I'm going to do the top up here first that's just a little Zeus faster with a quarter turn next hit here here and at the front and this will be the screw that goes in the bottom locked in there's a tab right here where the the fairing and the lower fairing meet behind the outer just make sure those tabs are lined up align that right there secure the top and then do the rear the to the front you want to firm the fairing and just screw over here alright so today we change the oil in our 2004 Yamaha r1 we install a flow stainless steel reusable oil filter and also a magnetic drain plug in there we went with a full synthetic motor oil motorcycle-specific with the Jas om a rating and topped it off tightened everything up button to back together we're ready to go ride thanks for joining us in r1 videos you", "Ig0rjI-0LQQ": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "QxJKZ5VDaQQ": "all right so I was taking apart my 2005 or one Yamaha stator I took out a generator wheel right here and this little bushing fell in there so I got this claw this little call to try to get it out and I can't seem to find it so I drained all the oil and I can't see where the it said it's not in here a hundred percent dropped it in here I saw it fall and I tried to get it with my finger but my finger was too small I mean too big that might be it right there is that it right there that looks kind of like it and I have no clue how to get that piece out I don't even know what to take apart I'm not trying to do this this was supposed to be a simple  fix and here we are so drained on the oil and I'm gonna see if maybe that's it down there all right I'll get back to you all right so I ended up getting the plastic rubber piece that goes behind this flywheel out I had to take off the entire oil pan which sucks which meant I had to take off the exhaust here so I'm gonna give you guys some pointers things that are important before you do this when you take this cover off right here unscrew this piece right here this center piece and you can put a screwdriver in here to make sure that the pieces behind here don't come out when you put it back in you can't really see but this gear right here has to match with the other gear there's no timing on here so you don't you could put it in any way you need to put it in but this needs to be completely flush with the casing if it's sticking out it this cover is not gonna go on so you can hammer it back with a little rubber mallet like a rubber mallet just hit it right here and it should go in but the gears have to match in between there so that little gear right here and you can't see it but there's another gear back there so just make sure that you don't drop anything underneath there if you do drop something underneath there it just goes straight to the oil pen so you know that if you drop something in there you'll have to take the oil pan off you'll get to it it's not the end of the world I was pretty nervous that was gonna be messed up but it wasn't I just took the oil pan off and there so I'm gonna put this all back together and if you have any questions just coming", "3CWK1hVrK9g": "itself today i'm gonna show you how to change all on a 2008 r1 in order to change the oil filter and remove the drain bolt we need to unscrew this this one as well here one here and there's a bolt and a pin underneath here alright so we're gonna start this [Applause] there's a bolt here see these videos unlocks pull it out and if you can see here so you basically have to just figure that a little bit and pull it back and it comes off just like that oh and also I'm gonna take these boots off there's a similar pin here so those are some of the pain here here take your time takes a little bit time wait until he comes out with the balls on the side you could use a break around here to open this all right also open up the cap on the other side so there's air going in the oil flows out and now we'll wait for the oil to drain drain out and then we'll continue the video again all right so the oils almost out now so I still have the gold outside doing some all the drain take out your new filter it's some old oil and most of the time it's lubricated and this one it is but I'm just gonna put it to garrulous just on the brim and then once the oil stops raining you could just plug it back when you tighten it only use your hand force don't go crazy with it once you feel like it's resisting stop right there don't go too far once that's done you can plug the bolt back oh also the bolts have a crusher washer make sure you change the pressure washer too [Applause] you could use a torque wrench to perfectly twerk it down but I've done there's enough time so I know exactly how much pressure it needs once you put the bowl back on put in the oil start your engine and check for any leaks if there is a leak here or if there's a leak at the boat check for leaks and once you're done with that I'll show you how to put everything back together alright so when you fill the boil if you'll please you also to make sure you fill up the oil above it's because when you fire up the pipe for the first time some of this oil is gonna go to the whole filter so fill it up all the way up fire up the bike [Music] once you have four there are no leaks at the vault or the oil filter you can start putting everything back together once you have everything back together you can check your engine on levels again to make sure if you need some more oil if you just go for a spin come back let it sit for like five minutes and then just go on that's enough so now we're gonna put everything back together start with the front kind of trick it takes a little bit more time pop this interest slide it that sound we go down first and then try to put this back and then just put the bowls back here basically put all the Bulls back together make sure you don't over tighten these bolts because they're in contact with your the plastic and if you over tighten them that might crack the plastic so be careful with that this this one this one once you're done with everything check all the balls again you can also you need both front and rear stand to check the oil like this or you could sit on the back and have your buddy checked it as you can see the walls gone down so what we have to top it off top it off to the line", "gF8Q7Eg71b8": "today we are going to be pulling off in the oil pan some unnamed shop did this look this is not the way you put an oil paint on look at all that sealant gobbledygook nasty nasty nasty a well let's just go ahead and pull the last remaining bolts out of this oil pan and see what it looks like male this is not the only issues I found with this pipe yeah spilling all over the gold yet I think I should know better grab our trusty deadblow hammer look at all that oh that big stream that surprise right there we get all this to seal it shut up inside you old man that stuff will come off plug up the oil filter pick up screen [Music] so actually just like was not started and ran for very long with that on it I thought the one Isaac and there's a bunch of trash down in there who knows what that is I know what that is that's what the stator they replaced it and put the stator in without a gasket ban the stator was finding against taste needed with turnovers and they deprived the starter so clean all that but we're going to fix this oh they didn't even use a gasket they only use black ceiling black sealant has the juices but as a gasket by itself it is not the right thing to use", "a6pmHR5Oclg": "okay so let's talk about this little video i'm making about a bad water pump slash oil pump on the fz1 uh i got this baby for a thousand dollars in arizona and um well i guess the water pump failed i didn't see any videos as to how to fix this so make my own here let's hope i don't break anything i'm not supposed to anyway so 2003 fz1 i'm guessing it's the same process for the 01 to 05 fz1 with the uh r1 motor i think is what it is slightly modified uh well this bike was running really good reason i've done this work or i'm doing this work because right now i'm in the process of getting the water pump that i bought from ebay is because i was mixing the oil and the water um the guy i got it from try to put some sealer in there i don't know if you thought it was the head or something but the bike ran perfect no smoke anything it's just that it started to mix the water with the oil so anyways here so i've already taken it apart so i'm gonna kind of explain what's going on here a little bit here's the um oil pan that i took off that you see there that's the water pump and the oil pump all in one and there is the reason why i had water in the oil is because they run together under the same shaft i'll take it apart in a second so you can look at it but i'm going to show you back here kind of what you have to do we'll start with you need to remove the exhaust so that's gone a couple little hoses there that need to be removed because it connects the outside to the inside of the oil pan and here we can get a shot down here what we got to get a good shot there all right so pretty self-explanatory when you remove it you just kind of see what's holding on to it and take that piece off anyways let's go back here so we can focus in here this piece here is your water pump oil pump mixture set it down here so you have a better be all right so anyways this bad bad boy is what goes bad in there now everything's good i can do seals and stuff on this and repair it the reason i decided to go get another one is because so we can look in there it's really corroded and this is what actually went wrong at it let me show you here that some internal seals that's what broke see here these seals here that broke therefore it mixed it all up anyway so bolt have been removed already that way i can pull it apart and this is your water pump portion of it you can see how nasty and corroded it's in there i've already cleaned it up a little bit but this impeller shaft runs both pieces this is your oil pump here water pump oil pump this face is down so this would actually go like like that that's this actual position inside the bike if you're looking at the bike towards uh from the front so there's a weep hole there's a small seal here this section actually pops out to be under the the oil pan if your seal ever fails in here this will leak out which i'm guessing it did because when i cleaned the oil pump or yeah the oil pan it had stained like it had been there but it also could leak back into your oil pump therefore you got a mixture which is what happened on this one anyway so if i take this piece apart here see if i can pull it apart this itself is the oil pump the oil pump there's another little shaft piece this goes in there blah blah we're not talking about the oil pump the impeller goes right through this is a water pump housing so let me see if i can remove it i kind of shoved it in there well in there if you are able to see i don't think you can not focus and there's a bearing well that small section above that bearing is where all the seals go they went bad and it went right through seeped through there came out to here mixed in with the water so i'm going to change this piece say bye bye to that i don't even want to fix it see how bad that is i don't want to fix that so i've seen focus come on or not anyways one thing i wanted to show you guys this little section here if you see this hole back here this hole here that's where this pipe goes through uh also connects here to this hose which goes directly to the radiator point is this one gave me a little trouble to get it out i kind of gripped it from here with some vice grips not too tight and just kinda just kind of tapped on and wiggled and tapped till it popped out just see how it goes here water pump comes through there another section it walks through i mean it goes through is a front right there that's the other section of the water pump radiator connection um i didn't take anything apart from the sides so if you look around i didn't take off some people were saying you got to take off that off there's a chain that links uh or spins the impeller for both oil pump and water pump but what i did is i took off the bolt from the inside so it's changed just hang in there not sure if i'll be able to get a proper view in there but we'll try see that chain right there that little chain i just took off the bolt slides right out that chain was really loose in there so i'm gonna say that's how it's supposed to be i didn't see any kind of tensioner on it to keep it nice and tight it feels really loose when it's on properly installed so i'm just not even going to bother with it believe it or not this motorcycle has 91 000 miles on it i gave it a good cleaning and all no oil leaks or anything like that just that water pump failure and it sounds great one mistake i did make i probably recommend you don't make it is in this little this removing the exhaust i'm not sure what this is for i think it i mean i know what it does because it shuts a um like a flap in there i'm not sure what it does it might be for acceleration or cutting off power on low i don't know what it does thing is i removed these three bolts it's got these three outside here one two three and it has a cap on it and then a couple of um cables that connect to it thing is that that cap comes off and you can remove the little wires and then this whole thing is just free to go as this right now as you can see all removed has another bolt here and a bolt there and then obviously the bolts that are up here that's it that removes it i made the mistake of removing the bolts from down here which they all broke so now i'm screwed without a little bit so we can pop this out so you can see inside a little bit now i'm trying to drill and tap these again kind of messed up there i made the hole in the wrong spot so i re-weld it i'm going to redo the whole uh little too much work if you say if i say so myself but this is what's in there this spins and seals through there kind of does that spins and seals opens and seals anyway if i can't fix this properly i'm just going to let it sit in there and i'm going to just weld here here and here so it's permanently fixed on there well not permanent you can grind it back down and be able to open it again but this is the first time it was ever opened and it's 91 000 miles since 2003. so i'm guessing this is probably never ever needed to be opened so don't ever take this off you might break them and then you're screwed like me but you know i can fix it easily it's not a big deal so don't make this mistake all right hope this video was useful i'm gonna make a video after it's all done give me details on how i reinstalled it um i'm filming this with the phone so sorry for the crappy video thanks for watching", "rcNDxHk-kyw": "now of course it's looking like it's going to rain all day today I decided I do the the mandatory 24,000 mile service on the r1 we're coming up on 24,000 miles it is hard to believe we've had such a good time with this bike it's unbelievable but anyway it is time for some service and I just want to pass on a couple little tips that I've learned over the years now it's hard to believe that over the years that how much use I've gotten as I've had several these and what these are this is this is something everybody should have as opposed you have a sport bike let me just show it has a little hook on it first of all there Freight whenever you buy anything at Harbor Freight they're free so you can't be dead one side of it is a flashlight of course you can just use it for a flashlight that's fun and Myles has a bunch of these he plays with but let me just show you what it's really really good for now it has the bright side here that has all these LEDs when you're working inside the fairing just like of the r1 that brought that light is so bright it's unbelievable yet until you actually use this you can't see how out Andy it actually can be I want to show this even in daylight what happens is you press the button once the flashlight goes on but this light if you can imagine this is really a bracket light and it is so handy let me show what I use it for and it's free this is a free tip everybody I know buys things at Harbor Freight so when you're there this is always one of the things you can get for free if you have the coupon and the r1 is typical of most sport bikes in fact that you have to take some of the bodywork off in this case you got to take this side wall to get in at the oil filter and I would highly recommend anybody that puts an oil filter on a bike with this level of performance safety wire it even if you're not doing track days eye safety why are you will filter because it's buried in there you won't see it until it's too late if it does leak the week winds up right on the back tire so that's just a just a little tip the K&N filters all have a safety wire hole and you can just pretty self-explanatory had a safety wire it and by the way if you don't have safety wire pick some up it's a good thing to have even just for the oil filter look how handy this is when you're working on it you have just that little hook that's on there even if you don't have the hook you can hook it to anything it and it really you can move it around a certain amount but now it gives you some light to work in by the engine and these this is really a unless you have a drop light and everybody that has a drop light knows that always winds up breaking a bulb this is a great little tool especially for doing this kind of maintenance now another tip but a lot of people don't do this but whenever you do in an oil change and and of course so it's it's pretty every bike needs an oil change well I have the faring products off like this I'll clean them up with the buffing wheel I'll take the little fasteners and run them on their buffing wheel clean everything back up to where it's like brand new when I put it back not everybody does that but then what will happen it's a little by little the bike starts to look older and older and older and if you do it every time you take the bike apart it stays looking no or as new as you process may be they actually run my face on a buffing oil I know you're thinking it i noticing once these pipes cool down it only takes a few minutes like a little buffing will the buffing wheel and I'll clean the pipes up again while I have the fairing this side of the fairing off it's very easy to get in here and clean it when the fairing is all on you got to bend your hand around and clean all I got and having this light what if light makes the whole difference that light it's such a thing you never think would be that handy to have until you go to work on something and actually the neat thing about it to it if you if you ride a lot at night you can put it in your pocket it's like a safety we can go look where normally if you if you think you're getting a flat you got to do it in the dark well this is a handy thing to have believe you just i never underestimate how handy this and that little flashlight you get for free from Harbor Freight to I'm not sure I can show this because the nice thing about the K&N filters and I guess other brands are but I use K&N all the time it is and I can't get in here because of a QRS honor I didn't get the last of safety wear off when you get to that once it's loose you can just spin it off transit but being able to get in there the K&N has that nut on the front makes it very very easy to get it off if you're doing your own maintenance now we all know getting that oil filter out can be really really a tight squeeze and fit and its best right now if you can to just go over a cup of coffee and let everything cool off because these pipes obviously everything is red-hot but it always comes out on an r1 on these cross planes it comes out on the right side and now we're going to just let everything cool off drip down and as I'm going along I'm trying to clean off any of the grease any the oil wiped everything down I'm looking for anything that might be loose and that light is a big help in doing that now get I do like Canaan the filters the thing I like about them is having this nut you enable a safety wire it even has a hole for the safety wire and if you were doing track days even more important but I always think whatever I spend on oil and filters I'm going to get back many times in enjoyment and because we ride this bike now there are times we have open to throttle once in a while that that I want to have the best oil and the best filter possible and I'm not like I'm getting paid by K&N but these I think are really worthwhile they're really good never had any engine failure issues whenever I've used llaman lube real llaman lube and K&N and not bargain-basement oil or not I use the oil they recommend in the annual before I put the new filter in I'll put a little bit of oil on a gasket make sure inside usually pretty clean on this bike clean it up anyway get a little bit of oil get it hand tight and in about a half a turns that's what I've been doing an ni safety wire and again the crossplane r1 is pretty easy to work on relatively easy but but there's only one way that oil filter goes down in there and it's really at some point in time if if you're not aware of how it does it's got to go up around and over and then I've got to get to the other side of the bike line it up make sure I'm not cross threading it and I get the safety wire on from the other side now I'm real fussy about another thing and I've over the years I've come to appreciate this if you have something else to do in the middle of this like for instance if you have to go mow grass or go have lunch or something it's good to just let the bike sit and let it drip because you get out an extra well maybe a shot glass full of oil and what I've done on the past I've moved the oil pan and put a glass under there to see how much oil comes out in about a half an hour you get about a shot glass full of oil so why leave that contaminated oil in there if you're going to do to bother of adding brand new in this case brand new llamo Lube 1040 may as well do it right here's another little tip these drugs come from Lowe's and what they are are my ten bucks each a rubber on one side so now I have a carpeted garage but this may be if you have a concrete garage if you don't want to get that oil on there or the linoleum or whatever but and you can see no matter how careful I am I always slobber some around but but now it's on a rubber back rug I can just take some simple green wash it down put the rug back in position and then when that rug gets used I can throw it away and I still have new partner new car this is 20 years old use new rug underneath it that's not a little soaked with gas and oil on everything so that's another I just I always like to put as many little tips on the videos I can the little rugs you can flip them to the rubber side when you do this kind of dirty work or drain a cooling system or anything sloppy and then just put them back when you're done and if they get through ready throw them out and just get another one for 10 bucks now here's another one of those little tips a little tip this is a painting stick you get for free it's not something even have to buy but it's a nice consistency of would not balsa wood or not you can take this stick put that in there fold that back so now you have something that you can get inside here see I don't want to have and it's just me let me let me turn the camera around here a little difficult working on my back I don't want any oil up in here and you can't really put your hands up in there I want to clean this up before I start the engine otherwise what happens I get smoke in the garage and then it's a big stain on the exhaust and actually I've polished these exhausts to the point where I don't want to lose that nice finish reasonably nice finish in fact this weekend somebody noticed up on Perkins the bike was just sitting in the Sun was just hitting the pipes just right and said Haley those pipes Wow and I was thinking well that's the way I want everything you know I don't want to have stuff that the and some bikes when you work on them I will they're so dirty inside it's not even fun to work on it when they clean at least you feel good about working on it and that lights you know that light is shining in there just makes this maintenance a little bit easier so you got two free tips here to stick the light and I got one more before the videos over this is a little tip Jose sent me and I went and tried it and it looks like it works pretty good this is chain and cable lube and he said he's been using it for quite a while it works good at when he told me that I went and looked at the chain on his bike and it looks like it's working the back wheel is an awful oil and grease and everything so it works pretty much like chain wax does and this will you have the coupon it's under five dollars for a can the chain wax is 12 or 13 another tip and another way if you don't and even if you have the money just gives you more money to buy more tires more whew all motor oil changers well I have these little fairings apart this is one guy I got to get some more simple green and this stick between the two of them they just a great combination for getting in spots and when you when you see a bike that's really clean you what how did it get and get that bolt clean and adage well this is a great trick worth its weight in gold once you have that stick you'll never throw it away and simple green couldn't be better another another really good trick a really good trick and inspect there's places you can't get too backed by the swinging arm and stuff you can spray some simple green and take the what I call the uh the air the air compressor put it up to a hundred pounds and get this little traffic I have one here somewhere here I got one right here we'll be prepared for a while okay this it's an air truck so I can get way in oh my I can do colonoscopies with this think wow that's pretty cool I didn't realize it was that that long anyway and that is as handy as can be just so these little videos that I make hopefully pass on some tips and hopefully you'll pass those tips on to other people now another small little tip when you go to take this plug off if it's tight to put the oil in rather than just take a pair of pliers or whatever take a take a microfiber like so that's applaud for me to do this right now put that microfiber on there and what that does what happens is you don't scar the plug up whether it's aluminum or plastic you don't score it up that's another a nice little tip now for many many years track-day street riding whatever always use a lot yama Lube now the reason is pretty simple I don't want to mix and contaminate oils and put half chemical no chemical but Crisco and I hope people do that and they seem to get away with it but this oil has never failed they have never had to to do any maintenance on an engine that was oil related and we have ridden the bikes pretty hard over the years another thing it's hard to convince people that you that want to put an extra cord oil in the engine that you're doing it a favor there's always two little window marks on the little glass window and I I have heard that when you put too much oil in as an example that you you the whole window is covered with oil when a bike is upright level and flat what what you risk doing is bull and our oil seals up doing other things that are not good for the engine of course if it runs low on oil you run the risk of doing some mechanical damage so needless to say every time I ride a bike I would check the oil and and try to keep it right in the middle another thing I've noticed if this is really something a lot of people don't on them it happens to them but they don't understand why it happened if you're doing it done your oil change and put more oil in and necessary let's say you're just about up to the top of the window all of a sudden one of the things that can happen is when you pull a clutch in all away that extra oil makes it difficult getting a bike dropped into the first year you'll hear that big clunk clunk and and if you get the oil down to the right level it minimizes that so a lot of things I put the oil in this this bike I I put the oil and very slowly when I get three quarts of oil in it I just hit the starter let it run for a minute then go have a cup of coffee come back and make sure I'm right in the middle of that window though I don't want to put extra oil in there is what I'm saying I want to be right in the middle of that window when I'm done [Music] Marquita injection I don't have a of course any of the faring parts I have wolf I want just run the buffing wheel over them clean them up these parts on the bottom of the fairing really take a beating and of course again our beautiful Hall [Music] and if you keep after these ports it seems like they last forever but when your boy we know you'd see your reflection in them that's always the test if you've got a part really buffed out nice you can work hose X well handsome that guy is Wow oh no now this is one of the good polishes to use again a loyal Harbor Freight mandrel that's a seen a lot of use a lot of wear and tear but what it's really good for I'm trying to do this when you want to get up there and polish those headers now with that lower piece of the fairing off this becomes pretty easy and I love to look at it the stain the titanium oxide but here's what happens every time you buff it off the next time it comes up it comes up even more brilliant because you're on a polished titanium surface instead of a rough if you leave the titanium rough and if you polish it once and do a good job and that takes a couple hours you really only have to do it like I'm doing that when you have the fairings off the bike it stays that way it stays really nice a lot better than steel those that's your shore and certainly a lot better than aluminum but that mandrel there that's that's the one I found it works real good now what everything buffed out cleaned up simple greens on the inside the outside all that's left is to put in eight or ten Zeus fittings that hold that back together and I think this this we would declare this oil change complete oh I always feel good about getting a day of maintenance done on these bikes now I know for another well basically four thousand miles and and maybe I'm going to live to be another year who knows hey anyway I hope you enjoyed the video and picked up some useful tips there's an awful lot of things about this particular bike that I like number one doing this service is relatively easy and straightforward and I'm learning more about it every time I work on it it gets easier and even replacing the slaughter when we had to after eight years that was not a big deal but we're coming up on nine years and of course wall styling is subjective and in the ayat if you hold it but I really think then in my a biased opinion I think the styling on this bike is one of the things that sets it apart from the crowd and it as I'm getting parts modified parts polished I'm liking it even more anyway hope you again hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]", "LE1UmbP-_6w": "all right so we're screwing the oil filter in right here so we're gonna show you how to do an oil change just put the oil filter I know there need ain't oil filter wrench for this job or a way to you clamp around this so we just put the oil filter on located on the left side of the bike just like so and then if you come over here on top this is where you fill the oil in and then on this bike down over here this unscrews this is your dipstick right here for the bike so take your oil level with that we've bought three quarts of oil over down there you can see and we're just putting the oil in we pulled the body off simply a couple screws on both sides it comes off really easy where we were also doing a carburetor cleaning so explai other than that pretty straightforward drain the oil there's the bolts at the bottom right over there you know at the bottom they you can access from the left I think it's a 17 millimeter bolt and now we're using the clamp man as you can see no no you don't have to kill it tightens on just tight enough so that I could come loose too easy that's good right there and then next take the oil take the course over here and then look look look into the motorcycle this is a 2002 YZF r6 motorcycle nobody questions or comments please comment below have a great day please subscribe and have fun working on your bike", "oWOw40wR5fU": "what's up guys today i'm going to be bringing you a video on how to change the oil on a 2011 yamaha r1 i know there's plenty of other videos out there on how to do this but with this one it's got the full graves motorsport exhaust and for those of you that have this exhaust you know it can be a pain because the headers get right in the way of the filter the filter does not have enough room to come out between those headers so i'm going to show you all basically just pretty much how to get everything out of the way so you can take the filter off um basically just start off with any other oil change you're going to go ahead and take your fairings off a couple quarter turn screws which is really nice and then the only other thing i have done is for the radiator and there's a one bolt that connects the bottom of the radiator i just went ahead and took it off and all that is just to give it a little bit of extra play room so first we're just going to go ahead and start draining the oil cut the bike on let it warm up and then drain it all right once it warms up for a bit i'm gonna go ahead and take the uh the drain plug off right here all right it's gonna be uh 17 i'm just gonna stick in the other dremel take it off caution will be hot right before we do that just make sure you pop the cap over here get that airflow in so it drains a little bit better ugh [Music] just let that drain while that finishes draining we're gonna go ahead and take the header bolts with this exhaust system i actually emailed the company and they said you do not have to remove the headers you just have to loosen them to give it enough room um and you can reuse the gaskets that is something that they said in the email so keep that a heads up if you have this exhaust you don't always have to buy gaskets each time you do an oil change yeah we're just gonna start by loosening those up and i'll come back when i'm finished with that all right so once you get the bolts loose you're just able to see that it's able to give it a little bit of wiggle room so you're able to uh right back far enough to get the filter out i'm not gonna lie if you plan on doing this by yourself the bolt if you're looking from underneath in the front the bolt that's to the left of the radiator uh hinge right here that one was a pain to get to uh your best friend is gonna be an extension with a swivel for sure so let's go ahead and take that filter off it's still going to be a tight fit to get the filter off with your hand so if you got one of these where you stick a wrench through there and an extension there is room right here to get an extension through to take it off these work great there we go and you don't have to do this step uh but you can take this little panel off just to give you a little bit more room i'm going to it's a 3 16 allen key just two of them here sorry i'm trying to do this with one hand one there take that off and then you just got one of these little pot roads right here and that's it for that okay so now we got the filter off i did have a little bit of a hiccup because whoever put the filter on before me put it on there good and tight i beat the living out of this thing just to break it loose you can see all the dang screwdriver holes i had to get into it but finally got it off so just go ahead set that off to the side [Music] and go ahead and clean the oil residue off your headers what i like to do is just get a little spray bottle some water spray it down i know water and oil don't mix but it makes it a little bit easier for cleaning go ahead and wipe it all down all right so before you put the new filter back on let's get a little bit of the old oil make sure you get it on that gasket some people say don't use oil use grease i don't think it really matters but you don't need much just put a little bit on there all right and then go put it back on and if it won't fit right through here all you got to do is go and uh loosen those header bolts again so that's what i'm gonna have to do real quick all right so once you get the filter on what i like to do just go ahead and turn it hand tight and then uh it's kind of hard but for tight spaces like this i'll still grab a towel and just set away and get a better grip and just make sure that it's hand tight and then i'll go back and just barely try and loosen it like just move my thumb around it see if it'll even break loose and if it don't then i know it's it's on there go ahead and uh you're supposed to get a new crush washer i'm gonna check mine no cracks or anything and it looks decent so we're just gonna go ahead and install this back in as well all right we'll go ahead and tighten that down same thing with the drain bolt these do not have to be extremely tight not exactly sure what the manual says but just like any other drain bar i get it hand tight now just go give it about a quarter turn so it snugs up and then i'll do it like this oops just kind of do it like that if it don't turn you're good you ain't got to put much force on it and the drain bolts back in and we'll go ahead and put the oil in it all right so we're just going to go ahead and service the oil um i did go ahead and print off in case y'all want to pause the video about the torque specs uh let's see if i can see this there we go i can pause the video for that and then also how much oil depending on what you're doing if you're changing just the oil with or without the filter let's see if we can get it up there that's good this won't stay in so i have to use two hands so i'll be right back after i'm done let it get warm and as it's doing that you want to go ahead and check your oil leaks if you see something leaking just go ahead and cut the bike off so once you're done checking for the leaks uh if you find any just tighten it up the filter or the drain bolt then after that you're pretty much done just put all your frames back on in reverse order and that's it i hope this video helped out guys especially for those who've got the graze motorsport exhaust i know it's a little bit of an extra hassle to change the oil but it's not as hard as what it seems but again i hope this video helped please press the like button as my first video i'm going to post help out let me know of anything i can uh do different uh video wise appreciate it guys catch y'all later", "pOno7z4HHFg": "[Music] welcome back to the vlog as always we're gonna continue working on the arm long today I almost had it done we were like this close in having it done last video you seen that I started it wasn't making any crazy noises so I thought well let me throw some coolant in the bike let it run kicked open a half gallon of engine ice put it in and what happened there is a hole in my radiator rot in this area so all of my coolant started to drain out so luckily I had a bunch of kitty litter empty bottles this is kind of a lot of empty oil into and disposed of unfortunately we're gonna have to replace the radiator everything was getting ready to go back together on the 2012 ro1 project and that happened so we're gonna have to get down here drain all of the colon out I believe that I can drain it from this bolt here [Music] so guys we got my factory radiator off and like I said it was my own fault I left this on when I was trying to get the motor out of the bike I should have just took it off but I really didn't pay attention to the damage that it sustained while I was trying to do that so this is 100% just my fault so my stupid mistake cost me $90 that is in that box but as you can see is sustained a lot of damage here so when you flip it over this right here was the side that it was leaking from it was leaking from right in here and running all the way over to the side and literally just pouring out of it i salvaged some of the engine ice but I believe I'm gonna have to order another half gallon as well which I didn't have enough to begin with but I'm assuming that it busted somewhere in through here where all this damage is although the damage is a little bit worse here so the fans are good but from what I've seen in the eBay ad my new one actually has fans on it I'm gonna check him if these are in better shape we'll swap them over and if not we'll just roll with what we've got so let me get this unboxed and we'll try to get this radiator put back on [Music] so God's comparing these two side-by-side as you can see this one is obviously in much better condition doesn't a few little small places on it but they guaranteed this one to be good it does look like the fans are just a little bit different I'm not real sure where these are two different years they're both made by Panasonic these are right here look like a little different version I'm not sure if they upgraded them over the years because this is a 2012 this is from a 2009 or 2010 so I am going to swap my fans over to this one and use it just because I'm not sure if these upgraded over the years or not so just to be on the safe side I'm gonna switch my fans over to there [Music] so guys we got the ready to replace so now I'm going to try to put what engine on I was able to save back in it just to see if there's any leaks I went over everything and it looks like everything is plugged back in and it looks like every all of the clamps are time to back down so hopefully this thing doesn't leak like I said I bought it off eBay for like 90 bucks which was a lot cheaper than all the other ones I've seen I will give the shop that I bought it off of a shout out in the comments below or in the description below check both no no we're going to put it anyway go ahead and fill this up check it for leaks and pray that it isn't leaking [Applause] [Music] so guys it's looking like we don't have any leaks everything is sounding pretty good so far no warning lots model seems good [Music] couple quick ribs so guys it's looking like that radiator swap was a success we have no leaks so now I just have to get one more half gallon of engine ice because I didn't buy enough the first time anyway so I'm gonna hop on Rocky Mountain ATV comm like I always do go ahead and order it tonight it should be here this is Wednesday should be here on Friday as well as the very first modification for the r1 I finally broke down and ordered something performance-wise for it so I'd like to get it installed before I ever take my first ride on this bike like I said when I got it it was already making the noise I have never rode this bike I've never clicked it into gear I've never did anything so it's all gonna be an experience for me and I can't really wait to share it with you guys because it's honestly going to be an awesome moment because this is truthfully one of my dream bikes especially the 2012 world GP bike love this paint scheme and when my buddy Brandon bought it I was incredibly jealous and now I've got it from him we got the motor swapped seems like it's doing okay when I have to put a new battery in it which I have over on the Shelf right now on charge because that one just seems a little bit weak if you liked this video smash the thumbs up button please subscribe to the channel because modifications are coming we're going to get some side-by-side content it's dirt content we get some supermoto content and we're going to get some Corvette content because miss Vette is almost ready to be dipped I have to get rest of the old dip off I had to fix the spot on the door the door handle and the gas door as you can see there they just have to sneak people what's going on on it I haven't blogged on it but I had to get that part of the door smoothed out that's smooth I just have to dip dissolve the car pressure wash it to get everything off of it then we should be good to go on the bed like I said subscribe to the channel give this video a big thumbs up and I'll see you guys on the next one [Music]", "2wws2-OcqMM": "[Music] hey everybody out there learning lantau from 10 thumbs pro calm happy to bring you another lesson today we're breaking down some ragtime finger picking rhythm alright so we're going to be going through five different examples we're going to get started as the bass and we're gonna build on it we're going to add syncopation then we're gonna spice it up and then we're going to look at something called three that's the four ascending and descending banjo style a lot of cool things and so the idea is that you take these apply them to your blues other songs you know country you're jamming with a person so much strumming you don't have to do the same thing you can get a little ragtime rhythm over top to create simple if any a lot of cool stuff if you want to PDF with all this information in front you can get one bit back by becoming a patreon or you get this morning actually at the site as well but if your patreon you get all the PDFs for all less than starting a dark patient capsule OHS daughter month but you don't need those learns I'm have all the tabs on the screen it's got less than 101 if you're interested plus ten those t-shirts be the coolest kid in school but if you came just cuz you want to rock it out that's co-ed they got my respected grab you Glade the brand attention span and let's go ahead and break it down right now follow me on it okay so we're gonna walk through five exercises to get this and the first one is going to focus on your thumb because you need to be able to get your thumb to alternate consistently and play these two the G and the C strings now I like a little palm mute as opposed to that open sound I like it a little more but I do that by resting my palm right here on the very very Britt I'm the bridge right here right over these two strings okay so now I know we're not going to be playing the E and the a string so you probably thinking why would I use my finger here but we're gonna use those here in the next example so we're gonna play through this two time oh two measures over the F two over the seat two over the C seven one over the F again don't worry too much about these fingers but you're gonna see why we're using them in a minute here we go [Music] okay now on the next step we are going to go ahead and add some notes on top so let's look at what we're doing here what I am doing is I'm using my pointer finger on the C string and my middle finger on the eighth string and these are gonna be responsible for my melody notes and my thumb is responsible for the bass note that relationship is something that's gonna have its moments difficult moments but it is a relationship that's built to last alright so you really want to get that under your fingers before you move on so just this and I thought we go ahead and look at how to add a melody note cool so we're looking at the tab we're looking at the screen we see most the action happens in the first and second bar and we're also going when we get there we'll look at the fourth or fifth bar as well so we're gonna start off by plucking our thumb and the e on the a string at the same time over our F chord as the first beat one alright one and you hear the difference now all over ringing out or with that little bass okay again so I'm getting that bass mute in there but you want to be really careful not to mute these other strings okay so it's too difficult for you to isolate these two strings here on the side of caution and left all those bad boys ring out all right it's okay so what we're gonna do is pluck that g string with our thumb in the a with our pointer and our index thumb drops down the second beat just like we're doing before and then the next time we come up we're gonna put our pinky on the third fret of the a string to get that C note and back down so that first bar is all right the next part is a little more tricky we're gonna take our pinkie off play the G in the a string at the same time put it back on for the scene the a string only play the g string and then play the open seal a so the second bar is we put them together we get all right and then immediately after that we're gonna drop that ring finger to the third fret and the pinkie to the third fret and play the seat [Music] don't let the ring out right and then play that bass okay so you put those four bars together we get all right and now the second four bars you can see that the finger picking the pattern is the exact same the only thing that changes is the chord shapes that we're doing okay so we put those two together we get [Music] pretty cool all right we're flying so the next thing we need to do is add syncopation our notes on the offbeat this is going to give this a lot of flavor so we're gonna be doing this in a similar way but you can see that we have some ends so let's look at that first measure the first measure is gonna go right one two and three four as opposed to one two three four one two and three four look at the second bar and it's one two three the same so far but then and four [Music] so that third note that that C note are that G note that we were playing and moved itself forward half a bar so let's go ahead and play through these four bars together all right now you can see that just adding that syncopation is gonna make it quite a bit more difficult so far as easily the most difficult thing we've done so far so I'll play it one more time a little slower [Music] okay we put up bars four five six and seven and we see it's the exact same scenario we have the same thing that we did last time or just moving these notes around a little bit to match the pattern from the first four bars like one two and three four one two three four and one two three okay so let's put both those together and I'll play through at a medium slow pace [Music] okay all right so really when you practice that because in the next example we're gonna be turning up the heat a little bit that's why we go ahead look at the next example okay so this one's gonna be over the d7 oh the nice bar chord a nice fat bar chord but if you can't get this mark or try the same exercise with the D or really any chord you want because the point is that this is the technique that you can apply to any chord progression you want these patterns are aren't chord dependent they're just creative dependent so they depend on you to apply them in situations that you want to okay so our d7 is gonna sound like this well this is gonna be over d7 chord Barre chord again but feel free to play a D major d7 that's really anything you want and what we're gonna do is we're gonna get some bounce going and we're gonna really really play with this syncopation so the example is just a four bar example this time it sounds like this [Music] okay so the first measure is one two three and four count amount man kind of mountain man kind of mount however you identify because what what you're going to need is to have a strong sense of that it's gonna accelerate your learning a lot alright and think about how it connects with your foot one two three and four and born the next pattern is gonna go one and two and three and four so with the exception of after the fourth beat we're playing all eighth notes that's something to identify when you're approaching it because then you know you're picking is gonna be consistent one two and three and four bars three and four the same as one and two so let's play through our fourth example [Music] okay all right now we're going into example five our last example and we're gonna look at this from two angles both ascending and descending and this is something that comes from banjo-playing yeah let me go ahead and play for the first example it's gonna sound like this [Music] okay and I've heard banjo players refer to this as three against the four because we're paying we're playing a repeating three note pattern but we're playing it in 4/4 time so your pointer finger now is gonna be responsible for your C middle finger is going to be response for the e and you are a ring finger for the a string with your thumb on the bass and what you're going to be doing is you're gonna pluck the C the G at the same time little finger and then when you get to the second B a and g string at the same time and that's going to be the hardest part of this bad boy is because your beats are going to be one two three four but the riff is like one two three one two three one two three so let's play through just the first measure together nice and super slow to get it back for that one more time one and two and three and four and okay let's play through all four bars the other nice and smooth here we go one and two and three and one two and three and four and one and two and three and four and now that's what the notes are sending you can do the same thing with the notes descending one and two and three and one and three and four all right so now we're gonna try it I'm going up and going down I'm not gonna count it out loud and I'm gonna play it just a tiny bit faster but still pretty slow here we go [Music] okay everybody there it was all five examples have fun with these mix-and-match them take syncopation away try core value with these chuckling and melody with them try them in a jam try and why another friend is playing the same chords and you play those ideas over top the ideas are limitless leave a comment below and let me know how you use them Rex I'm curious

separately here the nd usually accept three quick to the eye only a few minutes authority or final [Music] so this is pretty funny you really can't make stuff like this up once a year and today was the day I have to basically spend the whole morning at our Medical Group's office and go through a battery of tests because of health issues I've had in the past and they confirm that I'm not going to die in the next two weeks and that I shouldn't they always say why are you too old to ride motorcycles you know you're too old to do your own yard work you're too old to climb ladders from your pool to do this and that and what and then I say oh yeah I'm going to quit all that and I'm gonna you know just to sit on my front porch and get a rocking chair and then soon as I get home I Col Luciano let's work on some motorcycles and it's a long story anyway long story and I wanted to start the day off with it with a great story the doctor that we have now and it's a new doctor under woman doctor in fact that the man retired and he was great for many many years he recommended this woman doctor and this is absolutely a true story my wife goes first she went a week ago so Karen goes and she says well you're not gonna like this doctor she has no personality at all oh my god she's cold as ice and she's not you know you're never gonna have a be happy with her so my day was today I go in there she's Sophia Loren and she's happy as can be and she's wearing a mask and I'm gonna and you know yeah you like Italian food enough I love her I love her doctor for awesome anyway that's my funny story today anyway I've got this wonderful feedback couple things about that little thing I put on my father's story out on the internet I'm gonna try to incorporate the whole story into some future video on a rainy day or something but today I thought since it's already it's already AFL lunch I think it was too late to go for a ride and it's getting up into the night easy and I thought well this might be a great day to do the maintenance work on your one and then pretty much I'll be ready for another another 3,000 miles of of doing whatever is we do here with the with the motorcycle so rather than you know tell any more funny stories I want to get the day started it's it's already late in the day and get everything ready for you all change get a new filter you oil I got the oil I got the pan I'm looking around here I wanted to get this done and this would be one big giant step for mankind if I can get this done today so normally on our video we're feeding the fish breakfast today they're getting their lunch but anyway the whole physical thing did go good and they told me as long as I stop riding motorcycles I'll probably live another year and doctor furrows I said just keep eating vegetables and keep that healthy lifestyle I have and and make sure that Valentine radar detectors plugged in anyway every day to garden is nicer than the day before and boys never want to forget to thank nan de Nivola for getting us started with these zinnias we now have a zinnia form so one will change relatively simple thing just a lot of something that you tried always postponed I know in the past I've tried to postpone it and in the past I've gone and started an oil change and not realizing I didn't have a filter so yeah well you know now for me because I have rugs in my shop and and because I'm basically always a little bit sloppier and I think I am I always take one of my extra rugs turn it upside down sort of rubber back is up so if I happen to drip some oil on there just makes the cleanup a little easier and I remember the days of doing oil changes on my 55 Chevy in a driveway at my old house the driveway looked like an oil tanker that that crashed and sank now every one of these bikes needs a certain amount of maintenance and I have maintenance logs I have a whole book of notes and when I do to maintenance and has certain rules of engagement I try to adhere to now it's pretty simple I've had this bike just as an example since day one they recommend oil change I think this is an example every 4,000 miles and a filter every other oil change well you know the oil filters are so cheap I just decided right from the beginning I was gonna replace the oil filter and do it at 3,000 miles not four that's proven to be a good investment because here we have I'm guessing at least 60,000 miles on this bike and it runs like a Rolex watch and doesn't burn any oil at all and all of the bikes in my collection I want him to last forever you know hey I'm 74 I'm gonna be 75 so what do you think I got two more years left to ride three more years but but no matter what I got even if this is the last year I want them all to run like Rolex watches so it's an easy peasy job step one pick the bike outside you get the engine up to 180 degrees [Music] now in his separately here the nd usually beats up pretty quick to the eye it's authority or final the fuel-injection is what with the idol already 23 stand behind this fight you can feel the exhaust it comes out like boxing gloves I'm not sure that you have the inline bikes do that but they the cross plains they have they have a real cadence to them while we're talking about maintenance on his bike the Pirelli tire now has enough mileage on it that I feel safe and that it's finished the handling has been good and it's a relatively I'm I'm not sure how soft it is but the relatively soft higher they do use them for track days I don't know how it's gonna last I know they've lasted very long much longer time than the Michelin but black so I will see if that all comes before it ok we're up the temperature time to put the bike back in the shop and dump the oil now what's tricky about this particular bike because we have a lower in length the bikes it's an inch or two lower and it's it's a little tricky in the oil pan in the right spot so that we can get the oil out of a drain plug and a filter without getting look I've already got some on Gary's believe this I haven't even opened up that mic guys well it's on the gloves anyway but getting out of oil pin I'm just I just always try to do this as neat as possible and it it's always a little messy just a little messy like my grandson just a little messy so step one is five Zeus fittings that pull us parted our fairing off and then it's very easy you get the oil pan positioned and where you have to get it even with the lower link it's just a little tricky and so this is the main drain plug that's going to have to come out we're going to have to get the drain plug the pan in such a position and it is just a little tricky there we go now once we pull that out and then we'll be able to pull the filter out from under here and it's a little tricky wiggling it out it's not a big deal but it's when the pipes are hot that that's a little bit of an issue so I have a way of dealing with it what I'm going to do is pull the drain plug out and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to go motor gray so due to the weed whacker or something is to give this time to cool off before I get my fingers in there because it is a little deep then you can burn yourself these pipes are red-hot right now because everything is really hot right now I'm trying to be really really careful again I always try to keep in mind everything here is red hot right now roughly a hundred and eighty degrees that is the oil there's the drain plug and now now we'll just wait patiently and it's a good idea to rock the bike back and forth and take your time you can see that oil is is that's bad oil has 3000 a little over 3,000 miles on it now what I always do and it's a good little tip all these little loose fittings let me just show one of these what happens where the threads go I tried to put one little drop of oil on them it just makes the next time you go to snap them out they snap in and snap out beautifully that's a nice feature too Yamaha now while I'm waiting for all this oil to drain down they're just at it you could just leave the last spoonful in there I like to be fanatical about it get every drop I can out till I don't even see a slight drop but I have other things to do yard work today I'm gonna try to get them done while this is draining out now another good idea I do I just do this little rock back and forth thing and I always see another little spoonful of oil come out I'm sure I'm sure that doesn't make a big difference but I don't know I I plan on doing the best maintenance I possibly can and how long it takes won't matter because today's not a riding day [Applause] so it's basically been about a half an hour now and we every drop of oil I could possibly get out of here is out and truth and advertising here I always like to try to combine something I never feel happy no one I've trapped an extra spoonful of this dirty oil in there I don't know why so just just try to be the best maintenance I possibly can be because having these bikes this bike now is 11 years old and I don't want to compromise certainly to maintenance on it that's for sure might help if you use the right ranch - and nothing happens nothing happens good when you let the maintenance go now luckily our town has a good deal in our recycle center you can just go drop it off I usually put it in a milk crate drop it off get rid of the old filter and yeah in this case I'm getting rid of an old paper towel - so we get rid of all of that and then we're ready to button this up no I usually store these the old oil until I get four or five of them and then make one trip down there okay the filter is on tight everything's checked well the next step is to get this piece on and this of course is a pretty straightforward there's a bunch of little tabs that have to be lined up and once we're all lined up of course start putting the Zeus fittings in there are bunch of little tabs on this bed just need to be lined up and once you get one room lined up this faring piece has to get pushed then and then pushed forward and then the last of the Zeus fittings up here get lined up so it's actually pretty nice how this hole goes together with there's five fittings altogether and we're pretty much ready to wipe this down and put the oil in believe it or not doesn't doesn't look like I made too much of a mess here but when we're done we'll clean that up of course and time to get the oil and now I've heard I've heard I don't know for sure that some motorcycles not all if you were to put a quart of extra oil and you can do engine damage you blow seals out or whatever so I'm always very careful to get I put a boiling little by little by little run it for a split second check the window run it but I'll start by just putting roughly three quarts in it usually takes three and undernea just about you never know exactly it that last little amount is now because I got a lot of money invested in this motorcycle and I want it to last well longer than my life I use real llaman Lube I don't buy you know oil at Walmart or anything I really want to have the protection and usually if you try being cheap with the oil you wind up paying in the end especially if you keep motorcycles like I do that is always a little gauge on the side here tells you how much oil you're putting in but in the beginning until I start the seed oil come on a window I can just put it in slow I don't want to rush I don't want to drop a half a quart on the on the mat here on a rug or anything so this part of it once I get about three quarts put in there I'll check the window I want to make sure I got three quarts in before I ever even attempt to hit that slaughter button I didn't put enough in yet that I can see the oil coming up in window so again I really be safe than sorry because if I put too much in I want to be right in the middle of that mark and I don't want to take a chance on overfill in it since this this motorcycle does basically never uses any oil but I check it every time I ride of course let's see what we got right now all right we're just starting to see it come up on a window we're close we're getting close so at every time I do this and the one thing not to do that I found that I used to do it years ago I'd go a little extra where I'll never hurt anything and I put the whole gallon in and you don't have to drain some out but I don't know the fact is I don't need alene oh and and probably people that do this super professionally would be a lot more qualified than me okay now we're going to be getting closer and closer so we're gonna be doing smaller and smaller amounts of okay we're coming up very slowly now very slowly now I've got to be real careful that oil is almost clear cause it's brand-new oil of course now I've got it oh just under the middle if the bike is standing straight I'm trying to hold it straight and level and that that is always the right amount now what I'll do is I'll run the bike let it sit and then check it a couple more times before I actually go out for a ride but we have other maintenance to do to just kind of let it run for 30 seconds and then recheck that well that was right on okay after running it now I see I could use a little bit more oil I'm at the bottom of where I want to be so now I can add oil just a little bit out of time until I bring that right up to the middle of the window not a problem is a lot of times here you get impatient and you just want to get this done and in this case it's really hot out here but I do want to get this accurate and I have to go back and forth back and forth a few times but in the end to get it right it'll be right until the next oil change well I see I'm just a little bit on a low side I probably could use a couple more ounces of oil I want it to be right in the middle so we spent quite a bit of time getting that oil level right where we want it and the whole idea of running it when it only has three quarts of oil in it is you basically put in oil into the new filter filling it up and then if you just look at that and did hadn't run it you'd be whatever amount of oil in the filter off and I don't know if that includes all motorcycles but I know that from experience that if you're changing the filter you should run it let it sit for a minute and then check that oil again and it it sounds like it would be an unimportant thing that I love yep you know what in the end when you want to bike to less forever and you want it to run right and you want it to be reliable and you you take into all these accounts now I personally don't like buying and flipping bikes well I like to buy a bike and take excellent care of it turn it into as many evil twin projects as I can and we're coming up on the next evil twin project very soon thanks to Chris I will let the cat out of the bag and we still have work to do on some of the other bikes and but entire swaps and everything but but I like doing my own maintenance cost I know the bolts are tight and if they're not it's on me it's not on some kid that just got out of MMI and he's smoking pot in the backroom and everything I want to have that it's I'm responsible for it and the rest of the maintenance involves the chain and this is chain only has about 10,000 miles on it so relatively in good shape and I don't have a big loose spot on it yet so just check and I have and an interplay all around when it's on the sanest and the the knot when it's off the ground and a back wheel is hanging down is what I'm saying yeah we're good to go so I'll get my rag with a little diesel fuel and just clean this up just a little bit and we'll be good to go now what I always keep is an old rag that is its tool to be used or obviously waxing motorcycles or whatever and so it's real handy for doing this just getting a grit off the chain and again the little maintenance pays off I I just think and he older a bike is the more important it is to do the maintenance I think if you bought a brand new r6 and you let the maintenance go the world wouldn't end but if you got a ten year old one and you let the maintenance go oh I don't know I don't know about that but anyway I try to keep the bikes up I try to pass on the information that has helped me keep the bikes up into a a reasonably nice riding condition and what what's good about it and it works today is the day today is payday when I go for my physical and adductor furrow so says ah your blood pressure is good and your this is good and that's good and you know a I always think well part of that is the exercise I get from my my daily motorcycle ride on days that it's I'm able to ride and number to do it all my own yard maintenance and and things like that and I realize not everybody that's my age is able to do that but bent as long as I am I want to do it myself and I want to reap the benefit of doing it myself I want to go to that annual physical like I did today and have them tell me all good things and I'd say oh my god you don't look a day over 90 well I'm pretty religious about it and Karen big with the vegetables and I don't know and I'm big with the motorcycle maintenance and I've heard they they asked I remember I was Kevin Cameron I thinks it if you only do one motorcycle maintenance item what is the best one to do he says the oil changes nothing nothing prolongs the life of a motorcycle more than that proper oil change every I don't know they recommend the r1 recommends 4,000 miles I do it at 3,000 I I just say oil is so cheap and working when you when you let it go and you let things get out of hand and it spots burning oil and you have to do valve seats and everything up then your wish you had bought an oil tanker so I think this was really good good solid use of a day and I always try to think at the end of every day then I use this day productively or not wound well because I was in the doctor's office all morning I got this and I personally did this this is something you might want to do that's kind of free and I always like doing things that are free and they have a positive impact on the world every time I in this big office we go to there were people as you walked in people at the desk people like the doctor the nurse that comes in and I thank each one of them for their service I personally thank them and as at the end of it I thought I wonder how many people just don't do that they don't realize how important these people are keeping us out safe our family safe happy whatever and that we can go for motorcycle rides and have these maintenance days so I think it was a day well spent I'm like always say in the morning I'm ready to get out of the open road only it's really late right now not appropriate right now but I am so happy now I will be looking at riding a bike the next time I ride it with the fresh oil in it is there something about it I know it it's all done right I know I didn't leave anything loose I hope but anyway one final tip one final little thing that I know from doing oil changes on 55 Chevy's ever and I won't mention any names either I know every once in a while that you can you can do the day like this the phone rings and all other birds need to be fed or something and and you forget to tighten the drain plug all the way or you forget the safety wire the oil filter or whatever and when you do that and you put it out in a driveway and start it for the next ride you look underneath it is a spoonful of oil you're the guy so what I always would do at the end of everything is run it with I have to rub a mat under it just so I don't have to clean my driveway anyway good tip bet always better to be safe than sorry and super important to get that oil right in the middle you're not popping the seals out of the motor or whatever bad happens luciano pride knows anyway I hope you enjoyed the video I enjoy making them I enjoy share in my life even that little episode with my dad with his adventures in motorcycling every one of us that's interested in motorcycling has a different story to tell a different adventure at different some people like dirt bikes some people like Harley some people like side cars some people like Ann it is people like me to just want to have it all I Jay Leno and his will would say Wendy you're such a good guy I'm gonna leave you my whole motorcycle collection especially my h2 Kawasaki two-stroke I I will be waiting at the phone this afternoon to see if Jay responds to that anyway again thank you so much for watching [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "JgmcXvhf_nA": "I'm bright bands multiply track gear.com and today I'm going to change your cool on my 2015 Yamaha YZF r1 you're going to ride at the races okay you need to have some approved coin okay the glycol-based stuff that's in the blank stock if this motorcycle Springs will leave the other crash when you pull on the racetrack you will be the most hated person at the racetrack that stuff is harder to clean up than oil I typically ride with my friends from sport bike track time calm I want to get out there and do a day this weekend and I need to have compliant cooling right one other I'm going to use engines okay this is easy clean up stuff it's pre-mixed ready to use and the best part is this stuff okay it has resistance to freezing okay we've got freeze protection up to negative 26 degrees Fahrenheit including Michigan were based in this town had its bike for a few years right so I'm not going to use with water wetter stuff on it I'm not really racing this bike this year maybe next year in from the racetrack but that stuff it's off this is what I am choosing to use what we're going to go through is the procedure to change the coil on the plate I think it's to help a lot of other riders out there one of the first things that we're going to have to do is we got to get access to this I'm going to want to find the lowest spot on the cooling system to use to drain this out so we're not really gonna begin by pulling some bodywork over here on the right side on the motorcycle right this is going to get us access to our radiator cap as well as what I believe is probably about the lowest point on the system I like to do a couple of different things I like to drain it very thoroughly and after I've done that I will typically rinse more water through it right to get the majority of the stock coolant out of them so that pull that sauce shield off number four side fairing here I'm gonna pull the fasteners here they stock fasteners and now we need to get in between the forks here and pull some of these clips out right pushpins put in here let attach the side panel aside fan to the trend panel right close off down there inside a couple of little push pins pretty easy to find look around and where to get them body what kind of lighting really not that hard to pull off I think the 2012 our one that I had was actually in my mind more difficult in this one the other thing I also going to have to do is install my base body work before idle I to the truck okay got all the little pushpins out there when it come up here you've got a quick-release fastener right there batted out now to get this off okay what you need to do is you need to slide forward like so right you've got this clip here and then you have the spring steel clip up here it locks right in in the front and then you have a plastic clip here so good slide forward is going to get that off for you this is going to give us access to everything we okay so not have to take part all right so lowest point on the system is going to be this right here right so what I'm going to do now is in the grab myself a drain pan and we're gonna get started is I'm gonna pull a regular cap off that is going to allow the coolant right to flow out much easier when you're able to exchange coolant with air okay by allowing air to enter in from the top of the radiator here right then we're going to remove this and hopefully this is big enough that it'll suffice is some type of a drain here it'll definitely be really effective in helping leave the system that looks like that's gonna work out very good you see got good flow straightaway some men they really thought this part through remember dispose of this stuff properly right toxic stuff this will kill animals all this stuff right you need to treat this like it's engine oil you don't just go jump in the weeds once I get the motorcycle off the stand we're kind of lean it over to the right side put the drain pan under it again and let this stuff chug out of there the rest of the way and then I will run some water through it okay and once again still the water is going to be hazardous that you run through is you don't want to run a country water is going to be hazardous and we're going to want to keep that in here too and dispose of this all properly very important that you do that you don't want to go polluting your natural environment I let this run until it's pretty much done also going to pull off this coolant reservoir bottle appear and empty this out very very easy view perfect access right here you feel you've got the stuff on your hands super super slippery you're the guy that puts this stuff on the racetrack right whether you're racing or you're on a track day you will not any friends everyone will hate you it will shun you and trust when I tell you the racetrack in the organization to put on the event or be pissed if they catch you violating that cooling rule that is a big one for sure I'm going to put this in that pan and when we come back right we're going to be refilling the coolant system and it's important that you get all the ER if you have air pockets in there you know in the neighborhood of that water pump that water pump will just be moving zero cool because it's going to be basically in a cavity of air all right so be pumping nothing very important that before you take this motorcycle the racetrack you are confident that it has been bled out perfectly and you don't have any air pockets let's just want to show you how wanna do that ah okay now we're ready to go back together let the water empty system empty and flushed out a bit we're going to go ahead and begin by putting the drain back in we will use this to help bleed the system too so I can really tighten it up that much this bike so begin with where fill are ready okay funnel is nice to have here makes it a lot easier to get this in I realized this coin is the same color but let me tell you it's not the same stuff every organization has their own requirements make sure you check with yours before you choose the cone that you're going to put in the motorcycle last thing you want to do it's put in a non approved cooling and you go through this whole deal at the racetrack this is definitely something that's nice field have addressed before and show up okay what we're going to do is we're going to fill the radiator until we get to the top once we get to the top right we'll let it settle for a minute you'll find gravity alone it's going to help us with some of the air pockets after that I'm going to go ahead and open that drink down there because it's definitely a little bit in their pocket in that area right and you see what is our wander many tunes all right by the time you got a radiator filled okay and you've got your overflow jug the only one I go to looting this stuff it's this is pre diluted okay rag clean this up we'll come back we're going to be bleeding this is okay let that settle for a second now you're going to want to be kind of quick with this right because you know that you've already seen how this comes out once the air stops if there is any it's going to be straight : it's going to be pretty hard plug it for a second if you're using a clean drain pan you could literally dump this right back in the bottle and put it right in the bike okay so you don't have to waste this cool that's all I'm going to need to do there that looks pretty clean so you saw you have that one really good burp of air okay got that out of there and believe it or not that little bit of error is pretty darn important and now we're to come back up here and we're going to focus on the level inside the radiator and then we will also run the bike it radiators almost full we're going to let that settle a little bit when I take this cone here out of drain hand right let me use that to top everything back off I still suspect where they need to get into that if you buy two of these then you have plenty to do it and then you save the remainder the one jug for the next time you change it cone because like anything like change in oil this is something that should be addressed if it's a race flight every season it's a street bike every two seasons because leaving the coin there for too long right the stuff does start to fail right it can cause corrosion inside the cooling system issues you definitely don't want to experience that right a little thing I have to do right because I'm going to take the radiator hoses any hose and it can really reach and give a squeeze and if you look here inside of the radiator you can see the coolant level changing a little bit often times and I've already done a little bit on this pipe saying I'm willing to see much of a change but you'll actually see the corn level after a few compressions beginning dip a little bit when this helps to just purchase before you really start to play purge out as much air as possible and once I've done that my top this off just a tickle right and we're going to go ahead and run the motorcycle I'll put a little bit in here I'm not going to fill the checks I want to get myself to a position where I need to drain okay top this off a bit cap it put a little bit in here now let's start the bike okay now you see that I've got this right in between the hot and the cold mark right the march on the other side got our capped off I've got the plug in plug is type what were going to do now is I'm going to start the motor so I come in a running of it and I'm going to you and I the temp gauge okay do the same you don't let the white and warm up all the way keep your eye on this level okay Ryan here's what you're gonna see with your wine right got this hole we talked about that it's cap plug tight done no just between the hot and the cold mark there right when you can run it you're going to see this thing go up to you know somewhere around 230 degrees okay your fans are in come on in cycle at about 220 okay once the fans level it's up to about 230 it's going to start pulling it down okay and then you're going to see your cooling system begin to function all in the errors to getting the Persians way out okay and this one actually pulled itself all the way down to about 194 degrees and then it began to gradually rise again okay stand right in it that low to hundreds revved a little bit crept up to about 220 we saw fans come on again fans brought the temperature down into the operating range we've got the system is cycling and working as is on don't go pulling radiator cap off when it's hot that's not going to get you anywhere okay stuffs expanding it's just going to spray all over the place you want let it cool down before you double check it keep your eye on this level here right I'm going to go off do a session take a look at this see where my levels at if you buy one jug you're going to be literally right on that one jug here we use and stuff after you burp it out okay you build a loop pretty much pull this off of one jug okay I took just a sip on a jug too and I just want all the same stuff in there no water you can decide what you want to do there because the stuff is pretty dilute so one jug you could technically pull this off okay remember to take a look at the level after you've written a motorcycle and don't overfill this thing okay you want to give the system a chance to heat soak and her penny out okay in here so you want to leave some room to do that and this would be adequate room and Mike and we're between the hot coal or now it's time to put the side panel you want to start by lining up the clips okay I need to slide back in there and then you got that spring-loaded metal clip and give it a little push back everything jumps right into place this bikes pretty easy to reassemble from there come over here alright can I get lower fairing attach this nose down here by the oil cord got a little pushpin here slide that one in that's going to hold everything in place little trim panel here and slip this bad boy in put clips in place there really isn't too difficult to reassemble especially we put it in our directions yeah and that bad way backwards kind of like putting the rear side together watch my cameraman trying to text right now he knows every time I catch up testing to get some trouble Tyler and what's Friday stop texting little panel back then we've got our quick-release fasteners okay start up here four millimeter D and boom got that tight once you have this thing apart a couple times as I have and tell you this thing is put together really really well nominal job on this the spirit of one here you know taking this thing apart and put it back together really that difficult one more panel down here not even managed to find the one clip that I lost which was cool alright this back in there's a tongue on the end of that it's going to slide into a slot I want to get that all lined up nicely there are two fasteners here is your 5 millimeter so if you're a breast recall you wish right that's it you're done knowing you are ready to go and enjoy your track day with your cool change remember check all your organization's rules make sure that anything else it needs to be addressed is then addressed as well let this part just going to help get you through the cooling change this is how to change the ball on a 2015 Yamaha r1m brine bands for by track your calm", "R-Gnr_IWh5E": "what's up guys do you want to back as you see we're working on the bike what could it be today well as you see there might be a slowly coming and it's from the drain bolt I changed the oil over December when I was doing my prep videos as you guys saw and I noticed that when I put the pull the plug out had little aluminum rings around it which means it was most likely stripped it was pretty loose when I put it back in I put a little bit of a wet like it gave me well the profit so it wouldn't fall out but I decided it's time to rethread the oil drain plug so that's what we're doing today today this just came in from super crazy the plug is a 14 mil so this is a 15 mil rethread er and it comes with six plugs each with washers and it comes with well doesn't come with this but you can use basically a 5/8 turn this to thread the new basically maintainer your threads so first thing first we're gonna get this off the bolt off you seem to take a little to work we're gonna drain the oil we're gonna leave the filter because the filters relatively good and then I'm gonna show you guys how to thread this easy ten dollar thing off of Amazon but anyway I thought I'd show you guys cuz you know what do you do you like you don't want to replace the oil pan that's a lot of working on money so anyway I'm gonna get that plug off drain the oil and we're gonna go from there alright alright guys I got the drain plug out and as you can see so I put a lot of this wasn't the problem this ripped apart in the aluminum portion because this is steel or iron whatever I ripped apart part of the oil pan threads so boy was able to get through as you can see there's still some I put teflon tape on that to hold it until then GP ball came off pretty easily because I don't know why I've actually bit anyway we're pretty much done dripping we're going to make sure we really clean the surface before we start to rethread yeah I'll get back to you soon also this method has I've been told that it does not require drilling prior to so that's also something we're not gonna be doing we're not going to be drilling it out first we're just going to be threading so I'll let you know how that goes still dripping still dripping alright guys now we're going to move the bucket out make sure we have some stuff down to catch those little drops and now we are going to put this in here amber I keep turning there's gonna be some pushback but that's because you're cutting new threads should feel some also make sure you clean it out before you close everything off or get any monies out the bolt that goes in is about a little under arranged you want to go too far in as you can see this little shavings of metal coming out that's a good sign because we're cutting away looming them right now so now we're gonna come out and see one I think we went far enough make sure you have stuff found that very well that collects the oil very well I'm now gonna take one of our who bolts one of the new bolts with the washer ready [Music] looks like we need to cut it a little bit longer I wasn't going in all the way which means we didn't cut all the way through yet make sure you don't crosscut wanna make sure it was going in pretty easily until you start cutting it again once you get to me yep right there uncut turn then you should see some metal shavings coming down all right I think we went far enough this time have sufficient coverage dripping we're gonna pretty sure we're far enough so we're gonna run a little bit of this through make sure we pull out any little shavings I could feel it it spreads which is a good sign trends back in and we're getting all the way again make sure you're not tightening it too much and there you have it weary threaded and now we have a good bowl that hopefully won't leak once the bikes warm and try not to get stripped this time if you're the one shipped it if not don't take it to that same mechanic I'll catch you guys next time on Joe and twos", "wAnjHI32FpM": "welcome to another ukulele tutorial i'm lara and today i'm going to teach you a beautiful finger style melody this is a piece that i composed and it's a melody of arpeggios so the easy thing about it is that it's using the same finger picking pattern of strings four down to one throughout the entire piece [Music] once you get this pattern in your right hand then you can really focus on the chord changes in your left hand this melody is written for low g tuning and you'll find the tabs on screen as well as in a pdf link down in the video description first i'll play through the entire piece so you can hear how it sounds and then for the tutorial i'll walk you through how to play it line by line now let me show you this [Music] piece [Music] do do [Music] do now we're moving into the tutorial section of this video if you're not familiar with how to read tablature then i'll put a link above to my tutorial where i walk you through it step by step now let's take a look at this finger picking pattern and how to play through this piece the pattern that repeats throughout this entire melody is playing string four down to one i'm playing the fourth string with my thumb and then index finger on the third string middle finger on the second string and ring finger on the first string now looking at the first line you'll see the tablature and you'll also see the chords written above the notes keep in mind that when you see a chord name listed the notes that make up that chord are not necessarily held for the entire measure it's important to pay attention to the tablature to see which notes are actually being played to create the melody we're going to play our finger picking pattern four times in every measure starting with the first measure we'll play our pattern four times on our g chord moving into the second measure we're going to place our pinky down on the fifth fret of the first string and play our pattern twice [Music] now we lift up our pinky and go back to our g chord and play our pattern twice more now we're moving into the third measure and going to our c major seven chord here's what this measure looks like i'm starting with my middle finger on the second fret and playing the pattern once and then playing it again with my ring finger on the third fret back to the second fret [Music] and then playing it once more with all open strings [Music] now moving into the fourth measure we're going to our d chord this is the second fret across strings two three and four and we'll play our pattern twice here [Music] now i'm moving to this fingering where i have my index finger on the second fret of the fourth string and my ring finger on the third fret of the second string we'll play the pattern once here and then once more on d [Music] if you're enjoying learning this melody please give this video a thumbs up and thank you so much for subscribing one tip that's helpful when you're learning a new melody or a new piece is to start off at a nice slow tempo as you watch me play this piece or if you play along with me and a slower tempo would be preferable then you can slow down the playback speed of the video down in the video settings now let's walk through how to play the rest of this piece and then i'll play through it once more with the tabs on screen so you can play along with me now that we've moved through the first four measures i want to highlight that the melody of this piece is carried on the first and second strings or your a and e strings keep this in mind as you learn this piece and practice this finger picking pattern the melody will really shine if you play strings one and two a bit louder than strings three and four for the next line measures five and six are exactly the same as measures one and two [Music] for measure seven we're going to our c major seven chord to play the pattern once and then once on the third fret and then once on the fifth fret and now once more with all open strings measure eight is exactly the same as measure four [Music] moving into measure nine we're going to an a minor chord so i have my index finger on the second fret of the fourth string and then i'm also playing a c note so i have my ring finger on the third fret of the first string we'll play the pattern once here and then i'm placing my pinky down on the fifth fret of the first string to play the pattern once [Music] lifting my pinky up and playing once more [Music] and then i'm lifting my ring finger up so i only have my index finger down measure 10 is the same as measures four and eight starting on our d chord measures 11 and 12 are the same as 9 and [Music] 10. at the end of measure 12 we have repeat bars so we're going back to the beginning starting on measure one and we'll play from measure one through measure 7. at the end of measure 7 you see the words dakota and we're going down to measure 13 to finish the piece measure 13 will be played the same way as measure 4 except for the very last note so starting on our d chord [Music] i'm placing my pinky down on the third fret of the first string to play the very last note in measure 13. moving into measure 14 we're going back to our g chord for one long arpeggio [Music] now that we've completed our tutorial i'm going to play through the entire piece one more time this time the tabs will be on screen so you can follow along and play along with me remember that if a slower tempo would be helpful you can slow down the playback speed of the video do [Music] do [Music] i hope you've enjoyed learning this melody have fun with your ukulele and thank you for watching you", "P54OGfvesKU": "[Music] okie dokie we go next project is phaser it's going to be a totally different bike time i've finished and what i'm going to do is change its color totally keeping everything a bit on the download for now just in case somebody changes but i think i've got one in mind fork upgrade shocker upgrade is the forks quite nice little bit of a tidy up but not wrong with them at all just going to do the oils and seals before i put them on and that's going to allow me to fit radial brakes which is good and the rear shock is the r1 which are obviously that is as well there are one there are one that's a 2007 onwards and that's a 04206 now you can go above 06 which gives you the six pots and a few bits and pieces i've already done i messed about with a bit of pen spread a couple of bits up just to see how things are gonna look so yeah so let's see what it's gonna change into over the next couple of months the first thing we do is start removing all fairings and then just go from there i am i'm going to change the oil and the seals in the new l14 so i'm going to be fitting two f said one so if you've got it in the bike leave it clamped on and undo the top first which is a 24 mil which i've done obviously by hand and what i've done i just put a bit of tape around it just to protect the nut as well now these are i've just bought second hand so first thing first remove all the oil and seals and replace now it is a tricky thing to do because a little kit i'm sure you can buy something i made quite a bit earlier a few years back in fact to help me remove the spring because when you're measuring it out the spring has to be absent from the fog itself so those things first basically fit the tool because you put pressure on there to unpack the spring allow the chuckle sober to rise and then on top of that there is a well you can get a modified this is washer which then you sort of slide over chuckie's over to hold it in place allowing you to remove the top nut fully and then spring can be released so and it's not easy it's quite tricky if you've got two people then i want to just use them like so you can see it's not easy press down pixel needs to be up slide your washer in and then relax like so now you can undo that top 14 mil bottom as mentioned obviously 24 top not too tight [Music] now same again remove the little rod in the center to put it safe to one side like so and you're free free free free see plenty of iron in there still just look container and pour considering doing the seals and as well outer sleeve okay so pump the shock absorber up and down a few times until then release the oil a little bit out just in case there's something monkey in there he wants to go that is empty it looks like that are fine slow it come in means you're pretty much down the bottom quick wipe off remove the dirty oil you have to tube again inside isn't too bad all right dust cap off and then there should also be a little clip okay one side of the clip out on the side clip out keep your finger just over it so don't twang off into your boots somewhere safe now that seal needs to come out to support it all the way around oh there we go that's that seal out just now i can give it all a good clean should go yep there is a washer in the book top of that let's just give it all a good clean off i'm sure as well nicely into place location ease it down by hand nice and square and then it sits nicely on the diameter a couple little taps just check one of them so it seats properly yep it has make sure it's clean replace the spring up the push eyeballs into position like so starting position next i'm going to apply the new dust seal remove this for a second i can still get it out that's fine this allows you to slip your seal over without getting anything up in the way slide it down then what you can do now is check if it's clean but it's not so i'm gonna have a quick rug through with that nice and clean just gently work it round using tapered to make it a little bit easier that's it just gently like so we can lift the shock up again tire off then before you fit that out 500 and either 20 or 30 depend on your model up now to test is going to be about between the model 75 and 90 mil from oil to the top of the tube now what i've done i've marked 90 mil up here you can use a ruler if you've got one not bad good enough long enough forever now it's okay to rebuilding so those things first let me spring in you can do it with this then fine if you can't then take it off and put it on again let's give it a go with it okay so lower your spring around nicely still here actually getting it the right way up the next thing to do is to refit on this next thing is rod top cap at this stage i'll do is just nip it up right at this stage it's time to just tighten up the top cap onto the rod then now we need to remove that but also i've got at the same time necessary there we go a little gadget let's enough the seal very thin lined up now this needs to be 23 meters but as a removal do it once it's back on the bike you can see everything else has gone to position slightly lubricate the just cut from the grease around it work it a couple of times do you get a nice ring and then come right down it's all nice lubricated remove the excess the job is pretty much done so there you go thanks for watching hope everybody's okay all the best to everybody [Music]", "1hDC83n0gJE": "Oh guys so this is literally going to be my third video on my clutch the first one being the one when I first done the clutch after burning out the second one was when I realized I may have put in the judder spring in the wrong way around and this the third video is literally going to be about the clutch plates the friction plates one of you guys pointed out on one of the comments on my videos that the last plate that went in was actually meant to go in different from the rest of him and I went back to my videos and I had a close look and and it turns out to be right you were right asked friction plate that goes in actually goes in at a different angle than the rest of them and I looked at the video and I fought not this this I can't let this go I'm gonna I'm gonna have to take this off all over again get that last friction plate and put it in the right way around and then hopefully all my issues with the clutch lever and whatnot the FreePlay hopefully that that will get solid so that's what this video is about today I've had enough of draining out the oil so this time what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna try and lean it backwards onto the ground onto the year the sliders on the other side and this tire we've got this new tire well it's not new it's just a part one I bought cheap because of this as you can see I've got a punctured a obviously I can't ride with that so I'm gonna have to put this on get this porn soon it's Bridgestone battle-ax I had them on my r6 and or decent so yeah so I'm gonna go ahead and lower the bike onto the slider being very careful [Music] there you go oh gosh so got the park to it over now so we're gonna give you a couple minutes for all the oil to just drain down to the bottom and then we start taking the the cover off just to show you guys we've got the bike leaning totally on on the Year slider itself we've got the tip of the indicator they're just touching the carpet we've got the fairings as well that's just touching the carpet but all the way itself is on the slider itself we've also got full clearance of all the pegs as you can see that's just touching the coffee as well so that's all good advice and that's just the usual procedure a folio right underneath the bike just in case we get any spillage ease so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go ahead and take the cover off I must speed this up if you do want to watch this done in real time you can watch my other videos but once I've done that I'm gonna go back to real time and we'll see what we've got underneath the clutch cover that it turns out that the last friction plate is in correctly so the last time I opened up the clutch to sort out the agenda spring to put that back in the right way I must have also put the last friction plate in correctly as well if you can see though down there is all the other friction plates if you can just make you out it's going all the way down as you can see and the last one which is this one is just here and it's on its own and it doesn't go all the way down so but I had to open it up I couldn't have that in the back of my mind so I had to double check so hopefully guys that is the last of clutch issues until next time but yeah hopefully you watch these videos and you don't make the same mistakes that I've been making and hopefully helps you out if you did let me know peace", "IX6bMuYERsY": "what's going on YouTube welcome back to the r1 build episodes so today we are going to be addressing the major nasty culture issue it's like a oh 9 to 13 9 to 14 art once all come with straight from the factory they had this issue so we need to let you out the clutch in any gear usually first but you're starting out you'll get super bad shakiness or shutters from the clutch so what we're gonna be doing replacing one of the clutch plates with another clutch plate so in a sense we're actually taking this clutch and making it into like an O 708 r1 clutch it completely fixes the issue and I know Graves Motorsports the same brand that made my exhaust sells a kit but it's way over price you can get om Yamaha parts or like a third of the price so I'm gonna have links down below of where you can order everything up but let's get to work guys I'll show you exactly what you need to do I know all you guys are waiting for some exhaust comparison videos in that retuning video to be up but I saw I've not got the ECU back hoping to get that thing back soon so I can get this bike up and running so I can get back to work on the FRS and start busting out those build videos as well but since we are gonna be investing with the calash we're gonna have to drain the oil you can either drain the oil in the spike or you can just tip it on to the left side because we gotta pull the clutch cover off so this bike needs the oil change anyway so that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go ahead drain the oil I'm gonna have a full tutorial coming tomorrow so make sure you guys go check that out I'm gonna try to come back to this video and link it right up in that corner for you but if I have not and there's not a link up there just go to my channel and search our one oil change video and that will pop right up [Music] we're gonna need these three clutch plates and I'd highly recommend ordering up a clutch cover gasket as well this is not completely necessary but I don't want to have to redo this job because the clutch cover is leaking so I would highly recommend ordering up a clutch cover gasket so before we do anything guys we're gonna go ahead and remove this clutch cable up here we can push this adjustment all the way then you need have those slots lined up go ahead pop the cable off now I can go down to the lower part also while about is draining I'm gonna go ahead and remove this clutch cable so just grab this 12 millimeter wrench loosen up the nut go ahead just pop it off just like that now on the lever that goes to the clutch cover there's a little tab I'm gonna go ahead Bend that tab up and just pull the cable off simple as that okay we are now ready to remove the clutch cover so it takes a five millimeter allen head on to be using the impact if you guys don't have this just use a five millimeter allen wrench I like to go in somewhat of a crisscross pattern [Music] and as I'm taking the screws I'm putting them onto this rag gun here you want to want to keep them clean we're also gonna have to remove this little lever cover it there with a Torx bit so let me see the size that is so that is the key thirty Torx bit just like that the cover pops off I'd recommend putting that in a nice clean area grab a rag set the cover on the rag and the reason why we got to take this little cover off is because this goes into the clutch cover and that lever there's like splines on the shaft that runs down that controls that your push rod right there from here and remove these six ten millimeter bolts some people will opt in to replacing your Springs right now and uh graves they concludes that the springs with their kit but in my opinion they're not necessary now we will be removing the old clutch pack I try to pull out all all out at once or you can remove just plate by plate but I'd recommend grabbing another towel double it up because there's gonna be some oil coming off of it and just try to pull the whole pack out at once along with the pressure plate there's your little spring seats right here you don't want to lose those either [Music] we're going to take everything out in order because it needs to go back in the same way so as you're taking it out set it down on the ground I'm just stacking them the same exact way they came out [Music] as you can see guys all this looks and looks like it's an excellent condition yeah this bike still had that shuttering issue it's just uh just something they should fix probably as you can see I got all the plates out I'm gonna take this last friction plate set it off to the side because we're gonna be placing that plate now for installing these little discs we're gonna use the flat one first go ahead and open that plate up hold this and this will go in first go ahead slide that on now we're going to take the second disc and this one's beveled I'll show you when it comes out where this is pretty much a spring so it's cupped in like that you flip it on cupped out and you'll when you install it you want to come out toward you so go ahead install it and the cup is gonna be facing this way so out toward the bike now we're gonna grab our friction plate that we set in our oil go ahead let that drip down a little bit and now we can install this friction plate into the clutch it does not matter which way that one goes dad now we're gonna grab the rest of our clutch pack and install it back into the clutch basket doing this you're probably have to do it plate by plate or else you won't get everything lined up goes friction and then a steel friction steel friction steel back and forth just try to get him in the same order that they came out in [Applause] [Music] all these ones are in this slot here the slot here this plate is gonna sit like that the only place that sits nut slot there stall our pressure plate get a little spring seats on there if any any of them fell off if you minded and go ahead and install the springs and the bolts all six these bolts are gonna go to 7.2 foot-pounds that can reverse over to 84 inch pounds you can tighten them by hand if you are comfortable but I would rather just do right and tore come down from here we can go ahead pull off our old gasket get the new gasket installed I recommend cleaning up the gasket surface a little bit scrape any of the old gasket off then you got stuck on there [Music] perfect so I'll cleaned up grab our new gasket and install it I'm also gonna clean up the clutch cover or the gasket as well there's a little bit of gunk stuck on it how to dice it down I'm here that it's time to install the clutch cover arguably the most difficult thing is Chinese covered installed with this lever position position correctly actually made it a little easier to do this but you pretty much gonna get that little shaft inside the cover so I like to position it like that with the teeth facing the back of the bike and kind of get the cover up on there get it wiggled around but you need to get this lever on to where it needs to be or adjust it properly so it needs to be facing in so let's try that pretty much what I'm doing guys I'm just messing around say how it looks right if it is not right it's not gonna affect anything huge have to go back and adjust it well I will affect anything your clutch adjustment novi all messed up so I take that back so it's pretty up there I want to throw in a bolt or a few bolts here make sure I have the adjusted properly let's go throw on the cable I'm gonna throw it on down here and up top as well and it looks like I adjusted it too far in so as you can see there's also the free play with the clutch so I'm gonna go ahead bring this lever back try to get it back one tooth so I'm just going to mess around with it until I can get the cable back on how it was before without adjusting anything [Music] one thing you guys need to watch out for is to make sure these little heat shields up here do not get caught and when you are tightening this clutch motor down yeah it looks like we're good to go there I'm telling these two bolts down make sure we're good to go and once again that little heat shield caught in here I get all these bolts in and get these swords down as well all of these colors cover bolts our talk to you about five foot pounds five foot pounds is virtually nothing guys it's very very little from here we can install this little guard with the teach workers bolts put this clutch cable on all the way get this nut tightened on take it down with the 12 millimeter wrench they're just little rubber that goes on there good pop that on there and then go up top and adjust it to where you have just a very small amount of free play before that I'm gonna wipe down all this oil I have everywhere got how this thing looking fresh just got all new bodywork on it so you don't want to wheelie not from here if you drain the oil you just got to put oil back in it if you tip it over on the side just to back up and you are done go ahead ride the bike make sure everything's good make sure your clutches adjusted properly and you are good to go if you guys enjoyed this video I thought it was super helpful I know this is a major issue with like Oh nine to thirteen oh nine to 14 are ones make sure you hit that thumbs up button up below and as always thank you so much for watching really hope it helped you out and I'll see you in the next video tomorrow's video is gonna be full on oil change tutorial on this very same bike so if you guys need help with changing oil I'll show you how that's done see you then", "VuFVSjupuyQ": "what's up guys Rob here with arcane Motorsports and today we're going to be going over how to replace the stator cover gasket on a 2009 to 2014 Yamaha r1 now the process for this is fairly simple pretty much the only tool we're gonna need is a five millimeter allen head I like the t handles those come in handy and another thing that I have is I had to get a replacement bolt here's the part number for it nine zero one one zero - oh six three eight seven that's just a little button head screw a little bolt for the bottom here because from when the bike went down there's a little bit of rash and the the bolt was bent so I had to get a new one I also have the part number for the gasket which I just ordered today if you see we can zoom in on this guy there we go so that's a gasket 14 B - 15 451 - zero zero - zero zero it was $7 82 cents on part Zillah is where I got mine ordered it at my local motorcycle dealership so I should have the gasket in about a week but so first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna grab my five millimeter and start taking all these bad boys out and we're gonna pop that cover off so stay tuned [Music] all right so I just undid all the bolts that were around the stator cover what I like to do is when I take them off I like to set them down in the same orientation that I took them out that way I know which bolt goes where obviously you know these two on the side are gonna go here we got three on top so you know one two three and then two on this side boom boom and I got that one new one it's gonna go down here so sometimes on different bikes the screws might be different lengths so that's that's a good reason to do that I just like to get in the habit of it just in case you know I'm not sure if where stuff goes when I go to put it back so putting it in the same orientation is definitely a good habit to get into so I got a little catch pan for any oil that might come out there's one little tab here on this side there's another little triangular tab here and there's another one here so these are going to be points where you're gonna want to pull off pull on the stator cover so actually it's pretty loose right now so I think I might be able to get it off there we go that was actually a lot easier than I thought it was gonna be so let's see looks like that might be the cause of my issue right there where it was leaking it did look like it was leaking along the bottom so looks like the gasket might have broke apart a little bit you know it's it barely even looks like there's any gasket left so so I'm going to go through wait for my new guess get to come in and then we'll pop that on and we'll start the reassembly all right guys so a few days have gone by I finally got my gasket I went and picked that up from the dealer yesterday and so what we're gonna do is now that we have the gasket we're gonna take off the old one from the stator cover here actually coming off really nice sometimes you know when you take off a gasket it might have a little residue left over I'm just gonna take a little bit of maybe like a little bit something to clean up the edge here and you know get some of this residue off off the the case of the bike so that's the next step I'm going to go through clean that up clean that up and get the gasket ready and we're gonna pop that on here okay so I got the new gasket on here now it's in place looks like there's a couple little white marks probably to help keep the gasket have a nice seal from the factory so another thing to notice is there's these little these little column but they're kind of like little spacer type things they help lock in the case cover to to the block so just make sure you know both of those are still still in place when you take the cover off you know they might stay on here they might they might stay on the cover but just make sure those are in place when you go to put the cover back on now just got to make sure everything's lined up and I actually did go ahead and paint this cover just because there was that little bit of rash on there and I wanted to give it a nice clean look all right nice so we got that on there now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and put our bolts back in the same way that you know we took them out and laid them down so we're gonna put those bolts in there and tighten everything up [Music] so there we go I've got you know everything tightened up if you notice in the the time-lapse that I did you know I kind of tighten everything up in a star pattern just to make sure everything kind of goes on evenly I don't want it to get cocked to one side while I'm while I'm trying to put it on and you know might might mess something up so if you guys liked the video give me some feedback if there's anything else that you have questions about feel free to leave a comment below I'll get back to you guys also one other thing if you're if you're going to replace the stator cover it's the same process I mean it's kind of straightforward but I mean you know gasket replacement cover replacement same same process I've got other how-to videos coming up so keep an eye out for that and I'll see you guys next time thanks", "DKMJAsCeTR8": "[Music] so you notice my ukulele sounded slightly different in that playing example today and that's because I am tuned down a half step so we're going to talk about what that means and some of the upsides and downsides to doing so right now so what does it mean to tune your uke down a half step so normally when you look at your little clip-on tuner or tuning app you're tuning your uke g c e a from top to bottom so what it means to tune down a half step is you're gonna take every note down by one half step so what that means is my g string will now become an f-sharp so when I go to tune my g string here my tuner is gonna read F sharp and if you don't know what the sharp symbol is the sharp symbol looks like the hashtag symbol or what we used to know as the pound sign on a telephone so first note on the top string will be f sharp now something about tuning when you're going to tune down what you want to do is you want to actually take your string below the F sharp and bring it back up to F sharp so if you're looking at your tuner you'll see that the little wand kind of goes below F sharp and then you want to bring that back up to the middle so it's sitting right back on F sharp now I'm referring to if you're using one of these clip-on tuners but a lot of you probably use tuners that have the reed out where you kind of have to bring it to the center so the reason you want to do that is you will always want to tune up to the note you don't ever want to bring it down to a note so that's just something to keep an eye on as you're tuning to make sure that it stays in tune now that's something we'll talk about a little bit later so my next note here which normally would be C is gonna read B as in boy so a down a half step again C and B are two of the places in the scale that are right next to each other so if you tuned down a half step from C you're gonna be playing the B note my third string which is normally tuned to an e will read D sharp so the D sharp note is a half step below and then finally normally which is my a string is tuned to a G sharp so here's a little example of kind of bringing that up to pitch so I'm a right around G sharp now so I'm gonna kind of slightly go below that and then I'm gonna raise my pitch by tightening the string until I get sitting right on the g sharp note so that is how you tune down a half step and now I'm gonna talk about some of the upsides and downsides of doing so alright so let's talk about some of the upsides and downsides now that we know how to tune down one of the biggest upsides that I would say is for singers so let's say that there's a song that just seems like it's a little too high in your register so you're trying to play the song it's in the key of C but some of the high notes that you're trying to hit you're just not able to achieve so this is something that I do as a singer when I perform live is I actually take and tunes you tune my uke down a half step now what that does is that kind of opens up my range just slightly so that I can get to some of those higher notes that I wasn't able to hit when I was in standard tuning so one of the biggest things I would say and this is kind of comparable to using a capo to change keys but you're just going in the opposite direction so for singers this might be something you want to explore if there's a song or two that just feel like they're a little too high in the range for you to sing you might want to try tuning down now one of the downsides to doing this is let's say you're trying to play along with a song recording on Spotify or Apple music or something and you're trying to play the song in the exact same key as the song well you tuned down a half step you're gonna notice that your uke sounds completely crazy going up against the song recording so that's one of the downsides is that plane with recordings might be kind of weird feeling actually it'll feel really bad because it's gonna be completely different tuning but one of the upsides is that you are going to be able to sing with a little bit more ease the second reason that you might want to tune down your ukulele is for ease of play so let's say the tension of the strings there's certain chords that are really hard for you to press down or maybe you're just learning how to play the uke so you're building those calluses on your fingertips so by loosening the tension of the strings and tuning down a half step you're actually gonna make it easier for yourself to play now don't be afraid because all of the chord shapes that you're learning or will be the exactly the same however all of the chords will be named a half-step below so for instance a C chord would be called a B chord because you're going down a half step when you tune it so it actually takes the whole chord down a half step you don't actually have to change the shape however I do feel like it's a good idea maybe you have arthritic fingers it's a little tougher for you to press down the strings this is a good way just to kind of relieve some tension as you build your calluses and then you can always tune up as you go later but for the time being it might be cool for you to kind of try with a little looser tension now one of the downsides to this is if you only have one uke which a lot of us only have one uke not myself but a lot of us have one uke and tuning back and forth can kind of mess with the intonation of the instrument so I don't recommend kind of taking your uke and tuning it down every day and then tuning it back up later in the day because that does put some stress on your strings to kind of continuously change the tension of them so I would suggest if you do have more than one uke and you want to try experimenting with this take the uke you don't play so often and maybe tune that one down a half step and try it try some of the chords try singing with it see if the tension feels better to you and then if you like it now you have both options for you as you play and that's a pretty cool thing so in the summary they're good for less tension if you're trying to relieve some stress in your hands but bad maybe because it will change the intonation if you have one you so a few more reasons that you might want to tune down a half step one would be for style and variety so I know a few of you have probably heard the song Riptide before by Vance joy and you probably noticed when you tried to play along with the recording that his UQ's ounds like it's almost in a baritone range and he's actually playing a standard tuning uke but he's tuned it down a whole step so what that does it kind of creates a whole different vibe to the instrument and a whole different vibe to the recording so let's say you're a songwriter or you're just trying to experiment with some different sounds down tuning is a way that you can kind of change the whole sound of the instrument just with a tuning so it might be something that you want to do if you're experimenting or just kind of looking for a little different sound out of your instrument for example when I'm writing a song and there's a couple songs one called seaside and one called miss sunny day which you could check out on Spotify if you would like to that I tuned down the instrument now the reason I did that was because of my vocal range but also because I was going for a little different stylistic approach I was trying to make the instrument sing a little bit differently than normal so kind of just a stylistic thing that you might want to do to kind of just add a little variety to your plane so one more thing I wanted to mention and this might just pertain to those of you who are you performers so something that I like to do as a performer when I have to take my uke out and plug it into a PA system is what I like to do is I like to tune it down a half step now why do I do that well for one reason it's easier to sing for me but the second reason is as I feel like it's a little bit warmer sounding through a speaker so you being tuned in this kind of high range can kind of sound very Chingy and almost piercing sometimes depending if you have EQ capabilities when you're performing so I actually feel like when you tune it down a half step it just creates a fully warmer sound through the PA system which i think is a little bit more pleasant on your ears that's not to say that under standard tuning is not going to be pleasant to the ears but I've just found from personal experience that tuning down a half step does sound a little bit warmer when you're performing so it's something you might want to try I wouldn't say that you have to do this but again these are just options and I kind of want to just let you know about tuning down a half step alright so now we're going to take a look at a couple of examples here for you so now I'm playing my kala zero cote concert you hear that's in standard tuning so let's just listen to the difference here between standard tuning and a half step down so this uke is in standard tuning GC ei from top to bottom so here is how that sounds g c e [Music] now let me pick up my half step down tuning cedar top 10 or uke now we're gonna play same strings but now we're tuned F sharp B G sharp and G sharp so it's a subtle difference but there is definitely a difference when you tune down a half step let's take a look at a couple of playing examples now so I'm just gonna play a C a minor F g7 standard progression here in standard tuning so take a listen to this and then right after that I'm gonna play it a half step down 1 2 3 [Music] and now listen to the same progression with a half step down tuning here we go 1 2 3 4 [Music] so now just for fun let's take a look at what it would sound like in standard tuning versus half step down with a finger picking progression so I'm just gonna go see C major seven C seven and half here so here we go two three four and now let's take a look at that Zack same finger picking progression here and I'm just gonna do it with a half step down tuning one two three four [Music] well I hope you found this video informative and let me know if you try tuning down a half step leave your comments below let me know if you have any questions about this as well I'd be happy to get back to you and let you know so in this lesson we talked about tuning down a half step some of the upsides and downsides and maybe why you wouldn't want to do it so if you're not subscribed to the channel make sure you subscribe click that little alert button so you know when the next video is coming out and I'll put together some exercises on all for you calm if you want to check those out you can download the PDFs my name is Kevin thank you so much for watching today and I hope to see you next time for another you kiddy Oh [Music]", "OSclslVUU1I": "ok I'm changing the oil on 11 yamaha r1 as you can see have already started way ahead of you I should have started from the beginning but I took the seat off you don't have to take the seat off because i was getting the tools out because it's got this little out on wrench right here this is key for getting to where the oil drain plug is and the oil filter is right there and i'm fixing a deck get off so i take this fairing off right here hits in there on that on the floor you gotta use this boom boom boom if they twist off their real simple they look like this they all look like this you just twist them you don't have to twist them that much either because there are these really spinning ones you don't have to do any do much to them you just spent on once or twice and then they're off and this is on the bottom down here it's got two pieces clicks and right over there so there's two there one two three four total that you have to spin off and then three push pins there on the inside one two three the pushback and now right there and you just push you in on this dinner part just in a hole and they pop right out you save those because you got to put them back in to put these back on then the drain plug is right there right here I'm still draining them all out and if you have a bike stand it's high enough to shatter a standard this way you for my cars too hey there just like that okay okay so that too I got the author of their offer I had to go get a extender for my father-in-law because it's not long enough and I use this and then I couldn't get this thing to work this is horrible so I had to put duct tape around the old filter to make it bigger to make it bigger and it won't fit out here so I've got to come in from over here on this side oil filter off would be such a challenge but see look at that and I finally got some duct tape around it so it would catch this thing so got the oil drained there's my plug and there's my washing out yamaha cool then they give you a new one of these every time you buy oh I want to feel it there so I got a new one of these so I just put the plug back in the Omaha gave me a washer and hope comes with one of those you put the new one on put it on there screw it on out there then this is the this is the new old for it hola I always put some up off so that I can really get that feel good Oh this I'm gonna feed it back through there and screw it on you can see I'm an expert get all all over my pipes okay so I got it on there I gotta hand tight and then I wanted to get a little bit tighter now this one to where I could do past hand tight so this one will fit to do passing in time I don't know how to take this Oh usually I'm gonna loop 10w40 10w40 okay so I filled up oil I take this screw it on there I screwed it on the big one first so then but basically I want to make sure my oil I can look at here see these two moms you want to make sure yours from this line to this line and this is also you can check how clear do so look how clear that is it's just a little bit of bubble at the top that's where I like to run it not any more than that don't okay so i'll put all those back on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 11 08 tottenham back please put in the three push pin there's 1 2 33 push pins out there push them in pop them boom done cleaned it all up just for oil I wiped off the oil as much as I could under there I'm gonna see if so far your stress you you", "hRXNM3ygvpk": "so my friend just picked this spike up it's a five six three six and he's got a leak on his alternator cover or stator cover so we'll get taking care of that so this is bike tenders bike it's a ninja six three six the previous owner had to change the stator coil which is behind here yeah change it out and when he did he added a whole bunch of black RTV silicone to the gasket which is a big no-no and now he's got an oil leak coming from this cover so we're gonna take this off change out we're gonna clean the mating surfaces and replace the gasket first thing sometimes there's oil in here so we're going to get our green hammer underneath now we're gonna take this off you're gonna want to go in a star pattern so like right now I'm just breaking them so that it comes off evenly so it doesn't work all right so now we got them all off pull this off gently you might have to rock it a little bit you're gonna have a force because of there's a really really strong magnet in here pull the old gasket off right here this is a stator coil this is basically the same thing as an alternator for a motorcycle we have to clean this gasket surface here and we also have to clean and remove the old gasket watch out for your dowel pins little rods that stick out they kind of keep the gasket in place and make it so that when you put the cover on it stays aligned watch out for these and make sure they don't fall inside and when you put this back in make sure that they're there in place so for now let's clean the surface clean the surface and we'll move on to the next step whenever you're replacing a gasket you want to make sure you don't use RTV silicone on top of a gasket unless the manufacturer specifically requires that you do that Kawasaki is pretty good about creating gaskets that don't require that and as you can see I don't I can't really get this in a macro but this gasket surface is incredibly gritty and that's what the RTV does whenever it's with another gasket these gaskets are fairly thick I don't know if you can see but they have a decent a thickness to them and if you don't if let me just explain real quick if you don't know what a gasket is when two metal mating surfaces such as this mating surface and this mating surface when they come together like this they actually aren't perfectly flat so as you're writing there's tiny tiny little grooves that oil can slip through and create leaks so a gasket fits in between the two that are in it's sandwiched between and it takes up all of the space from the mistakes of the machining or the warping or whatever it is then it prevents leaks if you use an RTV silicone it's going to create this grittiness and it kind of in some cases increases the amount of grooves between the two and oil can slip through it like in this case RTV was not needed because of the quality of these gaskets it actually hindered its ability to stop leaks and now we're running into this problem so when we reapply this we're not going to add any silicone or RTV whenever you clean the gasket surface I'm using a razor blade with a little yellow holder thing you want to go carefully you don't want to score it really bad but I am using a razor blade and I'm going in a very shallow angle and you just want to scrape off any of the little crap that's stuck to it but do not score it be very careful and go all the way around I'm gonna do this to this surface and you're also gonna do it to the mating surface in the back once you're done clean it off with contact cleaner brake cleaner whatever you can you want this to be a very clean finish once you get the gasket services clean we're gonna get our Deltans and put them in the position that they are supposed to be they're supposed to be one right here and another one now we have a mating surface this this whole engine actually the lower half comes down so we have a mating surface here and a mating surface roughly around here right there so we have to put a tiny dab of silicone gasket maker material right here just a little bit not a glob here and here because their mating surfaces may not exactly be perfect they might be offset and that could allow oil to see through so we're just gonna get a little bit of our gasket material find where the line line up is which is right here so we're just gonna put a tiny bit right there just like very very thin we're gonna do the same thing to the other side which is now we're gonna get our new gasket and put it in place we'll get our new gasket and we'll Center it over the dowel pins might be a little bit tricky stuck in the back one there one there try to get it to hold in place they have a little grommet right here and we're going to put some more of this gasket maker material silicone whatever right on that surface because this makes an uneven surface as well so we're gonna put some writer out right about there I went a little bit over so let's get some and now we're good to put it on so when you put it on there is a strong magnet so you're gonna have to overcome it try your best to keep it centered here we go on take a dead blow hammer just tap it in place start their own Bolton if your manufacturers recommendation says that this has to be torqued down in a specific order then follow that recommendation right now I just have them snug they are not torque to spec by any means or tight at all so now I have a torque wrench set to one hundred and four inch pounds that's what these bolts call for on this your making model so you wouldn't torque them down you don't want to torque them down to their immediate torque unless it's like a really light to work like I'll just give that one like this we kind of want to go evenly so try your best to keep them evenly towards you want to go in a star pattern or go crisscross so that you don't warp the metal and they get torqued down evenly so you won't have this side that's really tight in this side that's all loose and that could warp the metal and give you a now we're gonna start clicking all right let's go around and make sure that they're all torqued down to spec you don't necessarily have to go in a star pattern so it's really that simple look at your manufactured recommendations on how to do tighten the cover and if you should apply sealant or not that's really pretty much it like subscribe comment", "50du-a-lA5Y": "here's the oil change video in my 2008 r1 there's the oil I'm using there's the part number from K&N first things start the bike up and let it warm up get up the operating temperature and then shut it off and you're gonna want to remove the lower plastic have you get the front plastic off the oil filters located on the front left of the bike right here I like to buy the K&N filters because it's a 17 millimeter wrench to get them off makes it a lot easier I get your new filter out take the plastic off and then put a light coat of oil all the way around the o-ring there so it seals when you put it on now remove your oil gene drain plug 17 millimeter careful the oil is gonna be hot I remove this cap off the clutch cover right here and then where you will on the top when you're picking out oil for your motorcycle if it's a wet clutch motor or wet clutch motorcycle make sure it's wet clutch compatible oil which right there it says that it is which contains no friction modifiers and it looks like it was about two and a half quarts to fill this up then reinstall your cap start it up shut it back off and then check your oil level check for leaks it's gonna smoke a little bit because the oil gets on the pipe when you drain it and then if everything's all set reinstall your plastic", "5MrAqppqXZQ": "[Music] so you free up a hand this is my water pump Inlet pipe water pumps actually inside the engine case there inside the oil bath got coolant and a pump flowing right through the middle of oil so there's two seals on here there's a seal on this pipe as it mates up there to the connection then there's that that silver ring there you see there that is actually the water / oil pump as it protrudes slightly through the engine casing you'll see there it's kind of wet down here the oil leaking right out of here up here my shifter seal wanted to do is pull off this shift your arm pull off the ring here if you can see that there's a snap ring in there and then they just pull the ring out pop out the seal put in a new ring put their snap ring back on put the arm back on good to go notice I set up a little differently normally this bar would run back here straight through here this shift arm would be down here but I've got it set up for GP shifting cortex rear sandwich comes a little bit of space on my foot peg but there's so much frequent grip on here that it's beautiful not even a problem so anyway I gotta get the water pump out so I'm gonna pull this pipe I'm gonna pull my oil pan got a got a remove my exhaust so I get down there you can see my cables here for my servo my exit valve are broken I've got this one zip tied down so it keeps the the exit pulled in the full open been running that way for years love it have no problems so back to this I pulled the plastic cover that sits right here get these wires are usually cleaner and in there whatnot so that being said in order to pull that all Punk for water it's an oil / water pump it does both I got a whole new clutch assembly so basically I just did a crisscross pattern here Bing Bing Bing quarter turn to loosen them then I pulled out all the nuts pulled off the oil fill cap stuck my finger inside for a grip use my trusty rubber mallet to give a few taps on and loosen it in to wiggle it and work it free pulled it out as far as removing the clutch cable I had to do that first simple little trick to do that I took a screwdriver and when there was tension on here I took the screwdriver pulled this this way like that just far enough so I could slide that clutch cable on out of there simple enough right that's what that thing looks like on the inside just recently repainted it so there you have sorry I didn't make a video I'm pulling that I've pulled it so many times I'm sure I'll make a video in the near future or hopefully not too near future so anyway I just broke the torque on these Oh folks you're gonna do this download the service manual not the owner's manual but the service manual you need to know your torque specifications for your bolts especially these guys right here because I've snapped one before his you can see I've snapped a few of them I replaced most of them these are new that's still old original anyway torque these things with a torque wrench when you're reassembling and don't go above the specs because this head will twist off real quick and if you're not careful you'll be stuck with a bolt stuck in there fortunately for me when I twisted off the heads guys need special tools for that tools get all these gaskets clutch gasket you can use clutch gasket here you can use a simple gray but it's a real mess and it's hard to clean this here every time sorry the camera works not all that great either trying to do this quick cuz I've already started any of you guys I've also replaced this pipe in the recent past it actually was dry rotted with Croke was leaking this bikes got over 70,000 miles on it about 73,000 miles on this bike still runs great just requires maintenance a little more often replacing parts I've replaced this whole water pump oil pump assembly which is inside hair in the past already so I'm kind of familiar but I'm still using my service manual so that I can make sure that I get my torque right that I take all the parts off that I need to socks you got to pull the clutch to get to there but the behind this clutch there's a chain which you guys will see shortly and that chain hits a sprocket on that all pump and you're not gonna get that pump out so pause the video here I'm also gonna remove this and basically pull this whole plug and pull that out drain it put it back so I don't have any drips obviously when I'm done here scrub it with soap water first time I polled the old pump was for a different reason and that is a safety precaution since you're all pumping inside your oil pan and it's bathed in oil that if your coolant pump seals go bad which happened to me a few years bags probably three or four years ago get cool it draining out of a hole in the bottom of your pant so on a no for r1 if you got coolant coming out of a hole on your wall pan you're gonna have to do this job or paying somebody to do it and it does kind of suck because it's time-consuming but whatever I pretty much have converted to only riding on the track now so get ready for the next track day clutch spring bolts loosened up wreckin hand twist them a little bit tight these keep Springs keep a little bit of tension on these bolts and you almost have to use a tool to get them like 95% of the way I'm screwed or you're not gonna get them out by hand now I used a torque wrench socket wrench to do most of the work for a little quick spin with Philips head to finish it off sorry again for the video quality folks I am NOT a trained mechanic I have a guy that just does his own work to save money save lots of money cuz all this labor cost a lot of money job's not hard it's just very time-consuming again like I said you need special tools to pull your clutch you can get the basic parts off without any special tools set this guy aside [Music] what happens when you pull all my clutch plates with friction plates now the best another tool you're gonna want to have as a magnet on a stick this tool is gonna help you can get your first couple of these with your hand but these guys the metal plates in between better with a screwdriver I mean a magnet kind of Jimi's this guy out of here take your time don't be in a rush cuz it's gonna take a while it's just know it works so I generally will take these clutch parts put them in an oil bath while they're off the bike and if you ever replace them you're gonna want to all bath them for 24 or 48 hours soak them in a pan of oil clean oil motor oil before you install it on the bike you can see you got to kind of wiggle a little bit get these guys out of here work it work it work them out save the magnet or work here no magnets not gonna help me that might be my last ring I should've counted these no it's not my last ring yeah the magnets kind of doing it these are the friction plates there's a lot less magnet magnetic material in the friction plate then there isn't another plate but you see it's working get this guy out of here again apologize for the camera work I'm holding the camera with the same hand I'm holding the magnetic tool and this is kind of awesome I got all of them out all the rest of them it looks like in one more shot yeah most of the rest of them should be counting these so I know I'm not and is that it and don't that's not it no no there you can also reach back here you can see this these holes right here but you can use all the way around you have to to get back there to get those last plates out and they gotta come out straight wedge them in there they're not going anywhere flat-head screwdriver might help out a little bit here don't play and that looks like the final plate which is actually held in by a snap ring and it's a rubber hammer to release these locks by putting the punch here tapping it to bend this piece back out you can see the little notch in the in that Center set apart there so when you reassemble this punch that down now they say to replace this not each time but I found that you can if you if these aren't damaged too bad that she can read punch down there and that'll keep that nut from rotating off if those are punched down into those little key slots see there's a slot there and a slot there so my clutch holder tool plates friction plates my clutch plates you're gonna pull seven of each these off still see there's a clutch plate and a friction plate in their clutch housing clutch boss clutch boss nut this is my clutch boss holders clutch holder just like a vise grip this was made by motion Pro suggested where fits well it's easier to do it your hands it's got a good grip right here pull down a little bit and clip-on pull it out it's really not that hard to do just one-handed operation here guys girls not gonna put too much pressure on that I just wanted to hold it I don't want to damage or break anything set that on my foot peg 30 30 it is a breaker bar I've got my 30 on trusty breaker bar it's a great leverage Oh spin and there you go that's the clutch boss nut coming loose okay good job so you're gonna have the nut it's gonna be a washer behind magnetic jewel oh it's very handy those guys aside this yeah sure just gonna pull the clutch boss off of there these this last plate and friction plate it's held on with a it's actually a locking ring on there I don't need to take that apart so I'm just gonna set this guy right here right now and you'll see this part that fell off this is the thrust washer or thrust plate sits on the back here yes it's in here so thrust plate and then check off the clutch housing or clutch basket as some people refer to it and wallah the entire clutch assembly is removed from the o4 alrighty then this is this chain I was telling you about this chain is your drive chain for your oil / water pump and you see this sprocket it sits on loose however I will have to release that chains these guys right here if they've been on for a while they can be very very difficult to get off actually the last time I did this I snapped the head off of one using an impact driver and it might require you to use an impact driver and if that doesn't work you snap the head off actually if you use the impact driver you can use heat put a torch on there heat that up a little bit and it should help bring it up I was not able to do it with heat and the impact driver broke the head off of one of my nuts is I ended up having to drill it out once I drilled it out I replaced it with this bolt and not this is not OEM this is om right here coming from this side so all right I'll get to it I put a marine type of putty on these I believe learn that trick for the marine okay yes Ross this Grogan all right just continue to remove these guys as soon as I broke it free the gasket I don't Gasquet highly concern about it like I say I have a spare however I just reuse this one again it's an exhaust gasket not overly concern it's got a little oil on it obviously it's gonna smoke so get that oil off what reassembling stock bike but as you can see the solution already put some room in there so I'm gonna continue with removal this part I normally like to work with music playing but since YouTube so and you know about posting videos there's audio don't get these aftermarket foot pegs so I've got some missing bolts in here no come from right here it's easy enough it looks like another 12 I've got my exhaust without having to remove the complete exhaust system giving it out of the way and now I'm free to move oil pan [Music] make sure you have your service manual work this stuff properly for two reasons one you'll have leaks if you don't or you'll twist the heads off your boat was that off the boat you still got a leak now you got a bolt stuck inside of casing be very careful using specialty tools to remove it or what you ever party happens with left hardware drill out and rethread that's great or you can use a grinder or a die grinder preferably die grinder and you need to turn the bike upside down or get it up on the lip so you can hold it drill bit very very straight I've got a rubber mallet plastic mallet something soft and gentle that you can tap on this with while you're working it free wherever you're removing engine parts got my hand down here to support this just in case it happens to drop pull the sensor out let me get that out of there soapy water then I always use dog Donna's crap [Applause] you can see that well pump assembly there that is a well in a water pump combination this side over there does the oil this side does the water right up in there so I'll get that next but I'm probably gonna wait till tomorrow and there's more light I can put a shop light on this but it's New Years Eve I think I'll have a cold beer maybe wash up relax for the evening in order that's according to the service manual remove the exhaust pipe exhaust valve pipe clutch assembly want a level switch lead coupler low level switch oil level switch lead holder oil pan well pan gasket dowel pins which are in the oil pan the drain pipe the oil strainer the oil pipe the oil delivery pipe relief valve assembly oil water pump assembly drive chain guide the collar oil water pump assembly drive sprocket washer oil water pump assembly drive chain water pump assembly for installation reverse the removal procedure I did skip the fact the cowlings drain the engine oil drain the coolant I'll show you some of these parts there's an o-ring right there make sure that you buy you all the ovaries you need you're gonna replace that o-ring every time you remove this part bolted in you just have to pull it out it's got a rubber seal on both ends this rubber seal here came off and was in the bottom of the oil pan which I removed from the oil painting because I bought all my seals I'm gonna replace them all including the two on this pipe so I'm just gonna grab this guy with a ride pull this out grab it with a rag work it out there we go spin action now other parts next step yeah should just be one boat hauling it and it's also got a rubber oil seal after that we'll take out the oil will relief valve assembly which is this guy right here you can just pull out by hand I don't believe it's bolted in it's just got a rubber seal hold on you grab it with a rag twist and pull all by hand the pry this pipe actually did it from the other side oh they're gonna make sure that we replace that seal we're also gonna make sure that I clean really well pull this off pull this off halogen sucker completely remove this pipe out of here which might be a because of this  exhaust in the way I don't know if I ever removed that out initially the last time I did this might not because I don't know if I want to pull my headers I have to think about that one unless I can feed that gasket all the way up I think I could probably feed a gasket all the way through there without having to take this pipe out so being sad a little more by the way that mating service a lot of work for one little rubber gasket oh by the way the newer part is black gaskets I was able to lift up a little bit here kind of work this pipe get that gasket off using a and E gasket removal tool pried it off and using a screwdriver and this tool I was able to work the gasket through the hole now it's sitting here son know I'll be able to replace that without taking this whole freakin headers off because these bolts are on here really hard I don't have an impact wrench I just go through that much extra trouble fun on half - she's got to be careful when I put the new gasket on when I'm running it back through here to get it to hear that I don't damage it or crimp it or anything like I usually buy two gaskets every time I order a gasket or an oil seal I usually buy two that have spares it didn't do that this time alright so take this out of here again I'm gonna pry this away from the oil pump a little bit another driver in there to keep it pulled away gene guide remove the oil pump chain die there came off from the bottom side so now my all pumps ready to come out one of these bolts in the front also has a dowel pin on it I can't see it from here from my angle maybe the camera can see it but as I start pull so I get in here start pulling the bolts out oh one of these will have a dowel once I drop that old pump out of there I can replace the seal in there reassemble I'm missing one seal here I'm gonna get away without it I'll show you which one I'm missing in a little bit so I'm gonna need your oil pan gasket these numbers could change don't go by what I'm showing you because they did sometimes change some of these parts so your best bet is to go on one of the online websites and look up the parts I buy my parts from boats net they have Yamaha parts and they usually have them in stock and they ship in a day or two get them know depending on where you are you get them you know within a few days you buy from any of these other places pro caliber Yamaha parts house any one of those like that you could be waiting three four five six weeks on some occasions for this type of stuff because they although they show it in stock they don't actually stock it so boat stock net will get you your Yamaha parts the quickest that I found look up the parts on one of the other websites get the part number and then come to boats dotnet that's what I recommend oil pan gasket clutch cover gasket - gaskets for the oil pipe gonna have a water inlet pump side this is actually the gasket I need to replace that's leaking all this for this one little three dollar part this is the pipe side of the same water pump Inlet pipe we've got our strainer gaskets water pump outlet topside or inner water pump outlet outer or mating through the okay's this is the one then I'm gonna have to kind of squeeze through the from the inside to the outside I'll show you those numbers so basically these two are on the same section these two in the same section these two are the same section not the same gasket and your drain pipe these are the same gasket these these are the little tiny ones one goes on each end of the drain pipe you can pay attention to the video at all you should be able to determine what the drain pipe is if you have your service manual you should be able to determine what the drain pipe is folks I'm not a mechanic don't sue me because I didn't know something or you screw up when you're doing your own work it's on you all on you I'm telling I'm showing you here what I do not showing you what a manufacturer might tell you somehow I failed to order it's the one that goes on the oil relief valve assembly I'm not gonna replace it I'll just use the same one I don't think there's gonna be any problem with oil and coolant leaking if they're into each other if this gasket fails or a ring so not I'm not super worried about this actually not worried about it at all I removed them both one here and one here there is also a dowel pin right in here the water pump is slightly loose you can see it'll move but it won't come out this dowel pin needs to be removed as you can see this housing is notched so I can actually reach in there the needle nose hopefully I'm gonna be gentle because I don't want to scratch anything with this metal on metal contact there you go water pump remove I'm gonna clean the mating surface there clean this throw on the new gasket I'm sorry oil ring and go back to reassembly that's your oil pump side that's your water pump side there's my this is the front this is the back something that I found is that this hole right here if you got coolant leaking out of this you got a bad seal and your water pump when I first did this several years ago I had to do it because I had cool it draining straight out of this hole what's really confusing me I didn't understand how coolant could be leaking out of a hole in an oil pan didn't make sense now this is up this - I bought this real cheap at an autoparts Thor came in like a four that's like a six-pack different links in sizes this is like a co remover Oh ring remover so if you notice I just take this guy in here Bing all right very good so this is where that o-ring goes so I'm gonna clean that again make sure I get any dirt or anything out of there and then I'm going to begin my I'm gonna put my ring everything gets torqued properly according to the service manual specifications I am not showing you the service manual because I don't want to get some sort of problem with copyright infringement these two mounting bolts for the water pump the torque eight point seven foot pounds o pipe seven point two foot-pounds oppai pump 8.7 foot-pounds according to my service manual 7.2 foot-pounds remember all these bolts get locked tighten all of them get locked tight everything again make sure you clean all your parts really well especially the matings mating services where Neo Rings are our gaskets are inside here this is where the the oil pipe I'm sorry the coolant leaking pipe forget what it's called a coolant leak out through this hall in the event of a seal failure make sure you get in there and clean that out too it's kind of exposed to the street it gets a lot of crap in there I wash this with warm soapy water very well inside and out completely dry now make sure you don't get any water inside your well area make sure your dowel pins are in place there's two of them I have one right here another one goes right here it's in the underside of the motor the oil pan bolts torque eight point seven pounds another rubber seal oil ring Oh ring that I do not purchase and I cannot find it online on the parts catalog they just don't have it it's the oil switch well level switch seal I can find the oil level switch online and the parts catalog but not the rubber seal my rubber seal seems to be in great shape so I'm just gonna reuse it up here 7.2 foot-pounds torque pipe single bolt right here 7.2 pound foot-pounds 7.2 foot-pounds of torque well level switch torque 7.2 foot-pounds oil drain plug bolt 32 foot-pounds of torque service manual also says replace the crush washer each time I generally reuse my crush washer over and over I do keep some spares on hand whenever I order one I usually order two or three that way even though I'm reusing my crush washer if it does start leaking I have one on hand I can replace it with clutch plates some people replace the inner piece in the clutch housing the outer piece let me tell you what folks about 350 350 something like that six seven hundred dollars in parts I've got these exact same parts sitting in a box over there on the floor that rattle replacing those parts you're not gonna get rid of that rattle where it's coming from is in here there's these little Springs little Springs built in you can't replace him there you go there's where rattles coming from it's not gonna hurt anything go ahead and leave it so you don't like the sound of it oh well doesn't bother to performance of the bike nothing's gonna fail because of it as far as I know works great because this part is not flush with this part and this won't rotate so I'm gonna reach behind move this chain so I feel it and I'm gonna push with my other hand boom there you go next step put your thrust plate in next part put the clutch boss those teeth in there you know line it up won't go like that and you notice and I get it like this okay clutch boss is on next step got the washer and a boss nut you'll notice on this washer it says right there out know if you can see it in this light or not I can see it this is out it means face out its out UT if you don't know how to spell now they say again to replace this nut nut goes locking tabs are okay they'll survive another another around I might actually have one of these nuts bought in the past saved it see this little notch right there not right there anyway not back on this 69 foot-pounds per service manual it's not exactly flush there like I said but super close I mean it's real close 16th or 1/32 of an inch or something now when I had it wrong before this he didn't see it on video it was like an eighth of an inch off so again I'm confident I got it where it needs to be and then I'll slide on my clutch plates everything goes a metal plate and then a friction plate then a metal plate in the friction plate and you can see the exposed plate in here there's a metal plate so my next plane I'm putting on there's a friction claim so got all my plates and metal plates in except the last friction plate now I've seen guys put all their friction plates in line like this I've seen guys put the last friction plate in like this and these guys I've seen them disassemble their bikes disassembled their clutch like that when they reassemble it they put it like that I've seen guides disassemble their clutch when it was like this and reassemble it like this it goes like the last plate fits here doesn't line up with the rest of them it lines up in this separate notch doesn't allow it to go all the way in the reason I believe it's like that is because I reviewed my video this particular video and when I was disassembling you can clearly see this last plate was sitting in this notch here not in line with the rest of them but sitting right here so there you have it that's how rias that's how we reassemble it um I put my cover back on there not a cover put that guy on there put a bolt in to hold it in place it doesn't drop off on me on the opposite side then when you put these back - when you put these back together as with any parts that you torque you really should be using a crisscross pattern especially with these bolts with these Springs you're gonna put them back on I'm gonna have them all in tighten them up a little bit tighten up tighten up tighten up tighten up tighten up Bing Bing Bing Bing Bing Bing Bing Bing Bing Bing I'm sorry Bing Bing Bing Bing etc you're with these Springs you're only gonna want to put a little pressure on each one at a time and you're so you can have everything go in straight together and when you get to your final torque seven point two pounds seven point two pounds on these and again I'll do everything hand tight before I put a wrench on it but when I do put a wrench on it I'm a little by little by little by little by little by little but a little but a little bit little till I get it all the way down to the point where I need to put my torque wrench on it and then I'll torque them all crisscross pattern again do not go past the torque values on these if you do you'll snap this head off I've done it before fortunately when I snapped it off there was enough of the bolt sticking through that I could grab it with the pliers or something and twist it off but if you get it if you get it up in there in here broke off you're gonna have a hell of a time so keep that in mind you really want to soak these plates in oil for 24 hours or so in advance of installing them brand new again any any certified Yamaha mechanics out there if there's anything I'm saying in this video please stick it in the comments below and just you know advise me if I did anything wrong I'll help the rest of the public out if I did anything wrong where I'm not showing you something right so other than that be nice to me folks I'm just putting this I put a lot of work into this video trust me I didn't have to make this video okay so I put a lot of work into this just so I could show you guys and girl what I do how I do my work and hopefully it'll help you if you don't if you've never done this before these bolts when I put the cover back on they're gonna be torqued to eight point seven pounds these guys seven point two [Music] [Music] you [Music]", "osatspthqNo": "hello friends for our next lesson in our finger style ukulele book we're going to be working on some patterns that are stolen from bluegrass banjo playing we won't we have any songs in this lesson but it will prepare us for the next few you'll see if the bottom of the page there's a chord progression for you to work on with these patterns that's just to give you something else to work on before we get to the songs but the only way you're going to get it is just lots of practice of these patterns in order until they become a second nature so let's get started the first pattern is called second finger lead and that's because it's the second finger is the first thing in play it goes to one thumb to one thumb to thumb to one thumb to one thumb to thumb and that's eighth eighth notes in a row so let's play a couple that with some chords etc so next up is the first finger lead that is one two thumb one two thumb one thumb 1 mm - thumb one thumb so it's called first major league because the first finger is first that's one and that one is used mainly when you're trying to get a melody note on the second or the third string you can even also you can alter it to put your first finger on the third string for this if you like so the second finger lead and first finger lead use together a lot just depending on where you're trying to put the melody next is a couple of thumb lead patterns the first one is what we're going to use when we do blackberry blossom so it looks like this it's a little quicker excetera you the last thumb lead we're going to use in build cheetah so go ahead and take all those patterns and do them over the chord progression at the bottom of the page and when they feel comfy you can go on to the rest of the songs there you go", "ANn8MX7HQAs": "and now we're going to install the oil in water pump I've already got a new o-ring in the side case here slides in and oil delivery pipe you got to be careful do not drop anything down into the crankcase don't ask me how I know full hole delivery pipe there's this little sleeve that drops in okay I have to cut away I couldn't find this bolt this is stuff he's a 10 mil bolt holds on the water pump put that down this is also 7.2 foot-pounds just about everything in here is 7.2 - chalk that delivery pipe now a couple of these will be blocked I'll point out which one those are going to be next is this oil pipe I have two new o-rings installed here and those have been greased right there that yeah it goes in there alright I found my bolts for this well these are all allen head sockets no Loctite just 7.2 pounds on these all right now my strainer I cleaned all the strainer out the two bolts need lock tight and don't drop these down 7.20 as well all right sprocket and chain the hard drives this is what drives the oil and water pump assembly brand-new chain so I think the best way to get this honest is feed it down from the top hold it down low enough so you can have enough slop the chain to push it over this axle and then go ahead and thread it around that gear let's rock it okay now you'll come back up to the top all right and then from the top turn this sprocket until it fits like that you lock tight on this bolt and this bolt is not a lot of there's not a lot of room here so coming from the top get that bolt down in that hole reach in from underneath as well just get it in there and get it started then you'll need to use a an open end wrench to get this bolt torque down there's no way I'll get a socket and my torque wrench so you know rely on your elbow calibration manual calls 411 foot-pounds of torque in order to put the final torque down on this bolt that holds a sprocket I just use a little allen wrench I just put it right through one of those bracket holes on this side and then that will allow me to put final torque on that bolt it's like that from there you put on this cover plate installation of the oil pan straightforward make sure you got your two dowels here and over here drop your new gasket cleaned and prepared oil pan all meeting surface is clean any last debris washed out and then then drop this down a couple of the bolts that hold this on need to be locked tided that is spelled out pretty clearly in the service manual let me get both my hands and I'll get this on its place another oil pan straightforward make sure you got your two dowels here and over here drop your new gasket cleaned and prepared oil pan all meeting surface is clean any last debris washed out and then then drop this down a couple of the bolts that hold this on need to be locked tided that is spelled out pretty clearly in the service manual let me get both my hands and I'll get this on put in the belly pan on it's going to be pretty easy bolts the manual calls to lock tight a couple of them I'm gonna go ahead and put lot of tight on all of them just to be safe just again the blue loctite so if I have to pull these back off again I can't without too much trouble and we bolt all this up and I'm going to clean up the sensor and the wiring that goes down it still got some grease and crap on it clean all that up put this back in and I think at that point I'll probably turn the motor back over so that it's resting on the belly pan just want to point out that you got to remember to put this little clip right here sorry you got a prefer to put that clip on this edge that holds down this oil sensor wire next up lower radiator pipe put a new o-ring greased it this just works its way in here make sure you don't crimp that o-ring as you can sip this pipe in sits down flush small allen head holds it in the lock tight and then the two bolts that hold the oil sensor in it next starter motor is in pretty simple slide it in and the splines on the starter motor shaft mesh in with this idler gear right here that's in I've started locating all these little dowels that go in each of the covers and I can't quite find the ones for the timing so I'll keep looking for those shift shaft cover is on and what else that's about it for now getting ready to put the stator and generator rotor on I'll probably come over to this side get the clutch on and start getting some of the timing gear assembly at the bottom I've just painted the cylinder head oh I got to put the bolt-in and so I got to figure out what the torque settings are for the stud bolts that go into the top so I'm doing stuff like that while the paint dries on the cylinder head I'm putting the crankcase stud bolts in manual calls for a little bit of engine oil on the threads drop it in go finger tight and then it says torque it to seven point eight point two this took me awhile to find because it's only in yeah it's only in the tightening torque section is not in the exploded diagram so seven point two pounds on these which seems a little light but either way the way I'm doing this is this is an m10 stud so I'm think I'm an m10 by 1.25 nut screw that down a bit grab one of the cylinder head caps then what you do is just tighten these together a bit there's a 17 mil just snug that up against the cap here and then once those are snug together then you can bring this your torque wrench in you can dial this down and then to take it off again use your torque wrench and your allen head six millimeter on the top and then hold that steady while you loosen this nut then both just come right off all right let's how you do these next up is to put the stator and the generator rid of cover back on stator slides right over here three bolts hold it in and then this cable has to be oriented so I cable has to be oriented to where it goes into this recess let me put it in I'll show you what that looks like all right the three bolts that hold on the stator lock tided torque down to 7.2 pounds put samyama bond on this rubber grommet that goes through the crankcase and then put your little wire block and orient this tab just like this so it holds that wire down as far as possible there's no torque setting on this but bigger socket I'll put this down to about 7.2 pounds also okay that tab is torqued down now generator rotor cover pull back a little bit just slaps right on there and then there's the holder bolt right there and let me take a look and see looks like they do actually to put a new bolt in here I've never quite understood why the bolt I have right there is actually fairly new looks like engine oil on the threads and torqued down to 68 foot-pounds now when I torque this thing it's going to want to spend the crankshaft so I'll need to go on the other side and hold it or get another pair of hands to hold that so I can get a torque down properly the other option is hit it with the air hammer and rely on the air hammer just to torque it up 68 is pretty snug so you know anything pretty snug would do", "wCqXpW4oOdM": "hey guys niko here and boy

there like this like this like that but yeah get I think it's easy oh you just work it around so finishes and the seal mate and we're gonna see hopefully I mean it's not after cleaning it it looks sealed clean everything up so when I ride it we're gonna let down I ride it I'm a rider and see if resealed if not [ __ ] scrapyard the whole bike and if you're wondering ever if you need to jack up your bike boom little giant some straps just jacks right up engineering right there so we did a little bath test and it's still leaking so if anybody wants to buy Yamaha r1 $1,300 because I'm scrapping it so I got I'm just kidding so I'm gonna have to take all this off for the second time take the shock out fork out and then figure it out [Music] [Music] [Music] done and it shocks out

oh my god so as Dino was dying okay so now yeah hopefully the seal set and it's good now if not then just going with Owens just cuz so we're about to add this oil in there and then we're gonna put it back together put it back in test it if it doesn't work oh no yeah update so after fondling with the seal it looks like on the inner seal I was just not out enough that makes sense and my mechanical terms but no more leaking Gucci what I said we got everything fixed so see you in the next video", "pSVUW-ghF9A": "what are we doing around we're working with the 2010 r1 and we are replacing the clutch on it now for those of you that haven't replaced the clutch and are debating on doing it yourself or you're taking it in it's actually an easily easy process to do a couple of steps that you want to cover beforehand the things you want to buy and have on in one of course is your gasket summer steal some will record this r1 is going to be I think it's kind of luminous so it kind of crushes once you put it under load cover back off so go ahead and get yourself a gasket of course get yourself the clutch it's going to be the fibers and the steel if I complete is one kit or you can buy anywhere from six to nine fibers whatever your bike calls four and six nine steals of course you need your friends with this one we went ahead and went with or net the strength spring tension on it is about twenty percent stronger so you're going to feel a little bit more stiffness in the clutch if you clutch in a lot if you have a gear change down one in the front and up to the rear where you really shift a lot you're gonna feel your hand is sore a lock with a lot more I'm also one with a magnetic drain but when you're doing a clutch you're not always solo these magnetic drain plugs it'll catch a lot of stuff in your bike that you never knew existed everybody records one of these now I'm pretty sure you guys are gonna be asking what kind of oil you use Wow it's empty I thought of a Castro Racing 40 comes in a couple different types we got ten ten forty you got twenty fifty and I think they come in a 540 as well this one here is a 1044 this r1 if you live in colder weather I definitely recommend tip 40 if you live and really hot with it like Phoenix or Southern California South Texas things like that if you run a 2015 r1 you're totally not going it will be a little thick in the winter time so I only recommend it for the summer other than that the tools you're going to need will bring your torque wrench you really want to get to the specifics when you're tightening down the springs the bolts that go through the spring so hold your clutch on it's going to be anywhere between five to ten foot pounds which isn't a lot this one here is a digital readout so I'm going to be really really difficult at this one I use it I don't want to over tighten those things that have them snap off before and you got to go on with the tap and dinosaur suddenly so don't put a lot of stress on your cover or your clutch but we're going to cover that a little bit work on that you're going to need a whether it's a socket whether it's the t-handle on this one a lot of other bikes most of the bikes just your standard bolts something like quarter inch or so the one thing you want to do is the night before thank you is you're going to want to soak your clutch plates the fibers that steel doesn't matter in oil brand new oil so it soaks it gets into the fibers you're not waiting for the you know things to get set up and soaked up with all the oil lot still on the bike you can and you can start the bike and kind of let it sit overnight but it's not very trustworthy and you can do a lot of damage without soaking these things in a little overnight first just little precautions let's go ahead and get started on the clutch so you guys can figure out what's wrong pressure plate looks good a good way to tell the warm pressure plate is right on the outside where you see my fernell app you'll get a lip right there and that's just from constantly going in and out with the clutch especially the Flex starts spinning starts slipping or not you get a little dip right there the only way to fix that is some come people falling down some won't most walks I would just get a brand new car you say loss of words I'm right okay I don't know I'm pretty dead on um had it lost it won't you play it just okay you  that's a Tom Selleck Tom Selleck oh bring it back to Tom Selleck oh I love it I love it yeah Billy Billy oh ha ha courage courage Oh where's the smoke machine in strobe light and it is spring-loaded to kind of help you with your clutch here on the inside as well you see it is goes right in the middle of that hole here I'm just going to make that line up right in the middle of all and the grooves will pretty much find itself but going to line it up for the most part Oh your gasket god damn it I've never done this on video huh but I don't like this where is it on the seat uh-huh gasps he's gonna be awesome okay  it I would pay for something hot as well I should put it on I didn't talk down your clutch yet the sprays my chocolate this video yeah", "9g8Si42K88g": "Oh guys so who you are with the r1 and unfortunately folks folks who started leaking again and yeah hopefully today I'm gonna try and clean the seals again last time I done it using this tool was over a year ago and and and the seals are held up for over a year so hopefully we'll try to do this again look at that it's hard to see clearly there so what I'm hoping is umm got stuck up there again and hopefully for you this cleaning out and hopefully that does the trick it's not it's the dreaded ourselves last time I used this as you can see I've got it all bent up and whatnot this is quite difficult to actually get it up into the seal it's quite tight and then getting it all the way around I've been hit up so I've only used this once it's gonna be the second time and if I can get a seal then it's all good let's go and try to do that now so I've taken up to God just the three bolts from both sides two of them are longer than the rest the one that goes in there these are the longer ones and so hopefully now get a better look at the fook itself I don't know if you can make it out he appears to be mainly coming out from around here not much from the back dark and see and should be looking like this one here really dry and it's not leaking all the way down I'm hoping it is a bit of dirt that got stuck up there last time I done this I said to myself I'm gonna keep these clean and that literally was the last time I clean them so let's give it a go it's gonna be stick the tool in there try getting it out and then pumping it up until we try to get a seal so let's do that not gonna do is a pop the dust cap down being careful not to scratch anything we do not want to get a scratch on this that'll be a disaster all right would something in between I just put that down naked hopefully see a lot of oil down there so then go ahead and clean this excess oil off tryna rub it downwards not up into the seal away from the seal what so he's pretty grimy down there I'm hoping we don't have any scratches or dents in there so gonna go ahead and pull out my tool and the idea is stick it in there and turn it around twist it around all the way around and this little hooked edge supposed to grab any little bits of debris or dirt or dust in there and you yank it out like so this is actually not as easier as you may look cause you have to curve it curve it to the shape of the the fork itself and try wedge it in between the seal and still is pretty tight so and when you do this as soon as you wedge it in you will get oil coming out and that's almost indeed you can make sure it's right in there as you can see just twist it around a lot of world is coming out I love woods come out we're gonna do is clean it all up it's a lot and also the dust cap that means a good clean as well stick that in there and just spin it around pick up in the bits come I was stuck in there so I'm gonna try seek these now and that's that's the tedious bit takes a long time sometimes let's see give you another little clean from the bottom up the dust cap has got a lot of dirt in there as you would expect our guys so not a difficult bit compressing the fukes by moving the bike back and then forward and then applying the front brakes last time I done this I think I've done it probably around 40 times before the oil started stopped leaking and I started getting a seal obviously you're gonna have to decide how many times you do it before you give up and and basically change your seals completely so hopefully goes well hopefully we'll get a seal within within that time frame let's give you a go one to a so I'm gonna do sets of ten and check the seal okay still leaking that's looking no but to be honest with you um it's already looking a lot better than before residue but this seems to be a bit more dry I'm gonna give that clean carry-on again I sewed on just on the second set of tens and as they were looking now he is already starting to look a bit better still the same little residue down here like I said last time I done this done it like around 30 times and yes sets of ten thirty times you do the calculations but to be honest with you what's your other option other than I would try this and try get a seal or go and do to your fork seals so yeah I mean to build yeah I'm willing to do this for a little while before I decide to change the seals so I'm just gonna carry on for now I'll keep you updated [Laughter] [Music] done about three or four sets of ten to twelve reps sounding like I'm in the gym right now but I'm seeing the results and that's what's keeping me going every time I do a new set I can see less residue remaining behind obviously with you if you if you're doing several sets and you're seeing the same amount of residue remaining if not more you're seeing more residue then you might have to just accept the fact that you need to change your skills but with my back here it's only got about 8,000 miles on the clock from new and are pretty much a doubt that is worn out through through age so my bet is I've got some dirt in there and hopefully I've got that out and now I'm going to try to seal the seal guys so six or seven sets in and I'm definitely seeing the results like I said it's the results that are keeping me going every time I've done a set I could see less residue remaining behind and that's what's keeping me going and a couple of pieces of advice I was using these tissues earlier on the nice and soft but the problem is every time I wiped the info I saw tiny little dust particles remaining behind and every time obviously you compress the folks you don't want that to get stuck in there that's how we got this leak in the first place dust getting stuck in there because of the folks coming down sharply so what I've done is I managed to go and find this microfiber cloth in the kitchen I didn't find this at first I was ought to use it from the beginning and like I said you wanna you want to wipe it down cuz any dust particles you don't want to wipe it up and leave it leave it there you want to push it down so when you compress to your folks they don't get wedged up in there again another piece of advice is when you're doing the rips don't half rip take the bike all the way back and all the way forward and then WHAM full on the brake so you get the most amount of compression on the forks and hopefully you get a seal so I'm going to keep going until I get a 100% seal and shall I get the seal and we take it from there Oh guys so check this out I've live and cleaned it this time just to show you this is the last I've done maybe set 1520 other low high and going to the gym today that's for sure but look it up I don't see anything at all no residue left I've not cleaned it this is what the result is after the last set for now I'm very happy with that so yeah there you go guys don't go around changing your soul just like that give this a go doesn't really cost anything just a bit of effort and yeah let me know how it goes peace", "MrF5AEn4OZQ": "a lot of folks JJ Millar here today we're gonna learn the best and the easiest strum you can learn on the ukulele but in an intro intro intro so this time we're gonna learn today is an easy strum but can be used in a variety of songs so remember when you're learning a new technique always start slow and work your way up to speed so for this strum there's only three movements that you have to learn the first movement you start from the top and go to the bottom once second movement start from the bottom then you go up once the last movement and the third is you stop and that's it so here's how it sounds now stop stop stop stop now when you practice that and get familiar with a strumming technique then you can move up faster like this [Music] so there you have it that is our easiest jump for today and this is actually the same from that he uses for somewhere of the rainbow so

bell so that you won't miss any of my videos in the future see you guys on my next video bye bye love you", "SgSWga6gJGg": "hi to everyone I want to make a video to show you how I change the oil of my bike I consider it the oil and other things are one of the basic main things that you should know to do on your bike I don't go to the make that move to the mechanic to basic things so it's something really simple and I want to show you how I do it one of the things the tools that we need only need a few tools like this this one is a socket 17 this and this that is pretty much the only phone tools we will need to change the oil I will show you now how to do it okay ah this is the bike where I gonna change the oil it's not my value all of you you know that drive has to Tsukiji say 1000 this is my friends by need I all change so I'm gonna do it with this one it's just Holly to teach today to show you the basic pretty much he is my technician mucho mucho you're gonna help me in bother me mmm this is the oil they always I use this is a car oil I have been that I have used this one forever in all my bikes and then we have any problem the companies always suggest you to use why they recommended premise also they want you to spend the money in this one thing I don't and there have any kind of issues also an another professional a professional racer when I go to race drag a and I need my bike you know on the top of the top so because it is not a case this one is more than enough for my bike and then the oil filter for the motorcycle also it will need a bucket to drop all the oil these are the bike this is not mandatory but this is it's recommended mega seems a lot easier this house on this side of the bike and we'll bring the bike up and make a strain this one is a little all so I cannot do by myself because I work properly you can buy other ones that new and pretty much you can do by yourself believe me but now is this madam okay before I begin removing the plastic I want to show you that this bike always have been used that oil and right now this bike have thirty thousand to 110 miles and this bike runs perfect without any issue without any problem so always have we have been using me my friends my husband or we we have been using these all and we never help from him the first thing we're going to begin is with changing a chain you know and removing the plastic so we can access to the oil filter [Applause] okay I just remove all the plastics and now you can see that we have access to the oil filter it's right here please make sure that always your bike is a hundred percent cold because you can burn your hands like crazy believe me always the bytecode to do this kind of job so right now that we have we remove the plastic we have access to the oil filter and we have access to this screw I don't know you can see it over here this is the screw that we can remove to we be able to dump it all the oil okay [Applause] okay I just remove the screw we are waiting for this definitive dump of the oil the next step is to remove the oil filter one of the reason the way I like this brand let me show you the reason why I like this brand is because this is I think the only oil filter that comes with this sucker so pretty much is very easy to put on and to remove it just with this screw the other one they are flat you will need a special tool to do it so that's one reason that I always also like this one okay here we have the new oil filter the fifth thing we're gonna do is to take a little bit of oil in your fingers to lubricate the seal then we're gonna pull back to there we're gonna hand tight and then only a little touch of this we don't want extremely tight need to beat up an extremely like you will not be able to remove later in the future okay after that we're gonna pull back the prologue okay okay the next thing we're gonna do is we're gonna wipe all the oil that can be on the bike and the path and everything because what that kink house is once you turn on them motor once you run on the bike you're gonna make a lotta smoke so to prevent that we're going to remove all the oil that we can have around there after this we're gonna pull the plastic back to the bike oh okay we just finished to put the plastic we just wipe a little bit all the spots we can be from your hands and next step gonna be to put the oil on the bike we're gonna come to this side here is what we're gonna drop the the oil right here you can see this is the limo okay this is the minimum never go to the minimum let's not get that off the bike and this is the maximum neither one don't go over the meat or the maximum all over the minimum both are I think the same bad always a steak you know always closer to the maximum but in a goodly were never over that convivial very bad this is not mandatory but maybe things easier my brother Chris like to tie the things pretty hard so I cannot remove by hand so I'm gonna use these to loosen okay [Music] okay we just finished up in three quarts of oil or next step gonna be to turn on the bike with that actually while we are doing is to fill of oil the oil filter after that we're gonna come this way back and check the proper label to see the bike need more oil or not [Music] okay we just let the bike running for a few seconds I need a long time and then we come this way and check the level we can see this a little bit below the maximum line so this is perfect that's the way I do the oil change I recommend always to check your manual because each bike why say this is the basic idea but each bike have their own rules please always listen to your manual this is just the way I do it have a nice day", "zngYRD_RN5Q": "so what I am going to do right now is an oil change on this 09 yamaha r1 and it's pretty easy i got all the stuff off already the you know on the side panels which is very easy to take off you can see it the Allen bolt to take off all this stuff that you see off you do not need off I was replacing a neutral switch and the speed sensor if you would like to see those videos I'll put them in the links below and you can go take a look at that and it shows me taking all this stuff off the way it is now it's really not that difficult pretty easy if I can do it anyone can do it today we're going to oil and i'm pretty sure it's probably the same through like 2012 or 2014 something like that i think to 2012 is the revamp here i think it goes to 14 for the ginger i'm not sure on that so go look I know I'm pretty sure to 2012 199 but your doctor right here in your own blog is obviously right there view it's pretty simple just going to take that up drain it put some oil in I will be making other videos on like flush radiator flush and all that stuff but right now we're just going to do a quick oil change [Music] [Music] well I just this is my first time doing this I just figured out the hard way that the oil filter has to come off of it be the passenger side of the bike the right side of the bike if you're looking at at the left side of the bike yeah so I'm going to take that other side [Music] so it's as easy as that you seem to put the filter on I just put a hand tight like I pretty much do everything plug it drained it took the cap off the other side over here just to let some air flow go through it drains better now I'm just going to fill it and I don't know exactly what it is I to look it up I think it's for court sick ilysm these I'll start it like three and a half and go from there but ya just gotta dump some oil inin that's it that's your oil change so I'm just going to sit this oil fill through up kind of rig it on there so it stays and fill the oil and there you have it your oil change is done get back on start it up let it run check your levels and you're good to go it's like three and a half think it's like 4.1 course for course something like that but pretty simple can look it up to make sure you're like is that a little rough but you did start really cold outside here we run boil it on to the next one [Music]", "u8cYRrm8w84": "hello youtubers I'm here today to change the spark plugs of my Yamaha r1 2001 model as you can see I've got the fairings off but that was for something different but to get to the spark plugs and we need to take the tank off the airbox and get to it from the top through there what's aging so I've got a steering dampener so it's a little bit more difficult to take that off so I can get the tank off but first thing you do is take the seat off just lift this up and see the bolts it Allen bolts take them off you'll have a bolt there for the tank take that out but first I want to take all this off so I can then lift the tank off so once that's done I'll get back to okay so I've got the tank off as you can see but the airbox off as the airbox down there as you can see we've got this cover over the top and you see I've pulled two plugs the this is what they look like two plugs like that just holes there just plugs you just pull them straight out and under here are the coils go there's the coils C bit further down able to get to the leagues pull them out and get to the spark plugs so I'm going to move this out of the way and take the spark plugs out and we'll go from there okay I've got the coils off and the plugs out and see you down there first thing you have to do is remove the oil sorry the throttle position sensor plug and then you can get this one up and then you can detach the calls from there the calls plug into that and that then you just pop pop the plugs out one by one and here's the coil see it now there see that's the wire plugs in there's a cause and as you can see they're numbered it's four three two that's number one so you know which way they go back in process from left to right one two three four so they just go back in the same one right so now I'm going to get in get the plugs here and go from there okay so we've got the first plug out as you can see as probably about you these are the old copper plugs it's a Denso there's a number of these I don't used Enzo's and I'm going to replace it one of these NGK CE o 9e sour nine is a regular copper for ng k that YX is the iridium and say I'm going to replace it with your idioms that way it's pretty much set and forget you'll get at least 50 to 60 thousand kilometers and these spark plugs so I'm going to replace all those and plug it for me okay yeah to try and get once I've loosened up the spark loader it's hard to get your fingers in or use the socket to get it out and so what a good ear is a spring-loaded coiling think kind of remember the name of it if you look on the end saw and can bend it down that open the floor up grab the spark flavor because also got a magnet in the end and just to be flash light can use that to get a spark plug out just bend it I can see the spark plug down any hope on the floor and there it is beautiful right yeah all the new plugs in and it's just a matter now of putting in everything back in reverse order and starting with the coils cell number again there's the old spark plug there I'll get everything back on and we'll start it up and see you guys okay so got the tank put the airbox back on start to put me steering damper back on but before I'd done better fire up and see if your kicks over the check all right I'm pretty good looking pretty good I'll take it for a spin so she'd go right thanks for watching", "npkxeQXQ4tI": "well guys I says my bike what I've noticed suddenly is I don't know if you can see the oil residue coming from the from the front fork and it's kind of a not very good sign at all like you can see the residues all the way down there I already do so I would have to take this into the garage and let's see what we can do all right guys so I've got my bike in the garage and I'm gonna try to show you exactly what I mean as you can see just there oil residue so and you can it is yep this is proper oil leaking from the forks which you shouldn't be so what I'm going to do is them if it's a good wipe wipe it down and then I want to show you how it's leaking so I wiped it down and this is eyes looking so my assistant is going to pump the shocks and we're going to see if you get oil residue gone mate so this is how it would look when you're riding and the shock shock the pumping up bar there you go keep going give a couple more yep and already we can see gonna put it back that's fine and put it back and then you can see there you go you can see clearly this is the clean bit is the oil of it is definitely leaking unfortunately our guys so basically what's happened is I'm popped a wheelie went to high came down too fast and when I check my folks after that that's when I noticed that item I had a leak so naturally I fall because of the way our came down hard I must have popped something but doing my research online apparently you can't actually pop your seal like a like a balloon that doesn't happen and so what they say is because none of the pressure or the forks compressing actually goes on the seal the seal is just there to keep the oil in and prevent it from leaking so what happens is the main the the main way you get leak is you get the stuck into the seal and why we probably notice it more when we've come down hard it's probably that's the only time we even bother to check the check our Forks is when we've come down hard to see what damage we've done and that's when we know it's the oil or the other reason is them if you get some dirt or some sand grains or whatever stuck here and because of how violently the shot comes down the dust cap is aren't able to move any of that dirt out of the way and weapons it slips in and get stuck in between the seal and the fork that's how we get leaks so for that I'm going to try and use this this tool this plastic tool seal may cost about five five six pounds and it's supposed to apparently if you can shove it in between the seal and the fork and go all the way around and that's supposed to remove any of the dirt that's stuck in there and hopefully and stop your leaking so I'm going to give that a go so first mover so I've got the bike understand so we're going to do is remove the mud guard so you can get all the way around the foop to use the tool and I'm going to do that now called the Chilean here so I've got my jumper on you can see yeah anyway so got the mock cut off and now I'm going to move on to the folks a so we do now is take these dust caps off get a flat screwdriver nice and gently you do not want to scratch the Chrome's get it in there and just wedge it down there you go there you go ask you see a lot all coming out there get your cloth I'm going to give this a good clean give a good clean all the way up against the seal as well all the way around we'll get a nice good clean get this rag in there you try get whatever dirt I can possibly get out so when I put the tool in there I don't end up actually putting more dirt in rather than taking it out so I'm going to give that a good good clean all the way up in there and then we're going to get the tool and we're going to make sure it's clean as well I put it in like this squeeze it in let's see it's not as easy as they make it look in the videos but this is in pipe and what you want to do is try and hold it with your hand push it down you want you want to keep this straight so the hook does its job and just get it all the way around although we run really isn't as easy as they make it look okay so then full turn so we're going to put it out like that and let's see if we got anything probably won't be able to see you know that's not going to be that big so yeah we'll try to pump it up and see if we've got our seal and if we have removed any dirt give it a good clean and we're going to pump up the shocks and see if we've achieved anything if a lot it's going to have to change the seals but it's always worth trying a quick fix right so what I'm going to do is now pump the shocks and try and see those seals see what get just one look pump it three so pumped it ten times and still got a lot of oil residue dear so give that a clean and what you saw me do I'm going to try to do that another 10-15 times and see see what happens guys so this is about the 15th time I'm trying to pump it and each time it's actually getting less and less the residue that's being left behind so let's keep going so come in let's see that's a lot less than when I first started and it was a lot more in the back that's also on what's going actually to be honest with you almost gave up after about five or six pumps and now I'll actually see the results I'm going to keep going high let's see how it goes I saw I've I've pumped up the shocks a good probably about forty times and about ten to fifteen pumps each set and it's actually cleaned up quite a lot I think we've got decent seal I mean it's not completely 100% single device a lot more still than it was before I'm sure if I'll pump it up another couple of ten ten or fifteen times you might get a better seal but I'm just gonna leave that there and just let it naturally pump as I rise it I'm going to keep a close eye on it but so far so good I'm quite shocked by the results and what I'm going to do now anyway is with the dust cap I'll do the same and give that a good clean so stick that back in there and just spin it around to make sure there's no dirt left in the dust cap before I put it all back together the dust caps definitely going to have dirt in there so we're going to do you know clean it up and put it back together alright guys so there you have it it's a lot better than it was before so definitely worth giving this a go before you go and change the sills peace", "YIr9UX3RBNs": "are you doing boys and girls this is the nickname of Giorgio my first name is Jorge and I highly recommend you to learn this as much as I possibly can or if not this might help you with your motorcycle ok I had a 2004 yamaha r1 and now i have a 2016 kawasaki zx-10r and i was looking to purchase filters and wherever you go filters or nine dollars ok and let's face it you're going to use the filter for a very short time and you're going to throw it away so i always like to stress on the people that I know and if they take my advice let's face it we don't want to throw away our money so this filter went to I say to my 2004 yamaha r1 and when i purchased ordered 12 of them for nine or ten dollars i don't i can't recall it was a great steal off of ebay so i kept cross-referencing numbers i said well what if i take this number and i can put this number here so kept googling and I kept review saying to myself well I don't want to spend ten dollars on a filter or whatever is the price so good thing is I put this I cross-reference this number in to you can see the number there of the Kawasaki upside down okay now this is the difference because by me kept keep searching the filters are ideal for each other the kawasaki filter is made in thailand and this is made in korea which i haven't i think it was really important where was made out of but they manufacture say either the filter is either ideal or better so the suck what's really important here is the sir conferences of the o-ring gaskets are the exact same okay and the depth of this sits in just a little tip tidbit deeper but guess what oh it's let's say quarter inch higher okay so that's why I've already put it on the bike works great so why spend money when you don't need to you can keep like I said keep cross-referencing bike years because you can find a great steel on 12 filters for ten dollars or eleven dollars and I need it because I don't care somebody's saying oh filters going to give you performance of it it's a filter okay you some use some sense I wish you luck and hopefully this is some advice that refer this idea to your friends that you know help somebody else that you can pass this down to a wish your luck", "dwtvCXyi0IQ": "next step in splitting crankcases is to roll the engine over like I've done here and remove the belly pan I taped up the mating surfaces just to give them that little bit more protection have a 2x4 underneath although I've heard that you can pretty much let the engine sit on those bolts on those studs down there but this is how I've done it in it stable enough I'll be able to pull that oil pan off and then access from the bottom I just removed the belly pan loosening all the bolts and I loosened the oil level sensor because the wire is zip tied along one of the tubes down here so I just loosen that it wouldn't really come loose so I pulled the oil pan off and I just capped the oil sensor out from underneath and then move the belly pan aside and here you go gasket interesting I have an o-ring stuck in this pan here I'm going to guess that this Oh ring went on the oil filler cap somehow got dropped down into the engine compartment and ended up in this strainer down here you never know what you're going to find all right things start getting a little interesting here if I followed the factory manual step-by-step it has you remove every single component a complete disassembly which is not what I want to do all I want to do is clear the way enough to split the cases so I think what I'm going to do is the oil water pump has to come out so you remove the cover with these two Allen heads here I've already just done that that exposes this lower sprocket assembly I'm going to remove this pipe and these connectors I'm going to remove this 10 millimeter bolt that holds this whole assembly end right here and then I'm going to see if I can scoop this out if not then I'll go ahead and remove this bolt here this sprocket bolt so I can remove this chain at which point I should be able to slide this whole piece out and hopefully everything else can stay attacked with that bolt off the sprocket I can now just very gently drop my sprocket down now I found that I do need to remove this strainer because underneath right in here is this pipe which is held in by another allen head and this is going to have to come off that will allow this assembly to slide out so cover plate ten millimeter bolt here sprocket head strainer this pipe right down here that should be enough to get the assembly up I just removed the strainer and that that drain pipe it looks like it's a return pipe that brings oil back down to the pan so now this pump definitely should be able to come out now let me drop the phone so I can go put my Wiggles in there we go she just broke loose and lift straight up and what do you know you got some gears down there now it's getting interesting what I've done here is take all these components I just removed underneath the pan and and bag them separately that way I know which bolts go with which component otherwise when I go back to assembling this I'm going to have no clue which bolt goes where and I'm likely going to get a bunch of them wrong even though they might work so this is going to help me on my reassembly it's worth the little bit of extra time I continue to bin up my components in groups the groups to them sort of using for disassembly well now we're at the removing or splitting the crank case step there are a whole lot of bolts that go into mating these two crank case halves together I'm just going to follow the procedure here like with most of the rest it requests that you loosen very slowly quarter of a turn until everything's loose capping very gently with a soft mallet on the reinforced areas of the crank case not on any of the thinner wall areas and then we should be able to pull apart as I go through loosening and removing all these crank case bolts I want to point out that if you look really carefully there's stamps on the crank case itself that give you the ordering of what bolt to loosen in what order and then there's also a reverse sequence to reattach and that's true everywhere so there's a stamp here here here I'm loosening all these bolts in this order at this point I've gone through and I've loosened every bolt I've done any order that the factory manual said to do it and according to the numbers that are stamped on the crank case I've got every bolt still sitting in its hole completely removed and unthreaded and the procedure now is the book says take a soft hammer and go ahead and and on one side of the crank case begin tapping lightly it says and make sure that you're tapping and reinforced areas so I've never done this before I'm going to start I'm going to let the camera roll the whole time and we'll get an idea of what kind of forces really needed to remove this crank case I'm guessing it's going to take quite a bit I mean the whole mating surface is glued together so and one thing I'm trying not to do is hit the mating surfaces themselves and I'm also going around it says hit one side but I don't really see how hitting one side is I'm pretty sure I've got every single bolt loose I stop briefly just to go around one more time make sure I didn't have anything that was holding me back I beat on it for a little bit they're not super hard but I want to be slow and methodical very careful so really the best reinforced areas I have are up here this piece here so I'm just going to keep working this area and I can see if I get this oh there we go there we go okay so this side is pretty good I think I'll go on the other side now I do the same so the opposite side over here and this is the side where the oil filter and well cool are there's not a whole lot of good reinforced areas here and maybe over on this side here if I can hit right where these bolts go in there are some pretty meaty areas also just find a little bit of lift with my right hand there we go alright I think we're about 80% dislodged here looks good whoa oh there we go it was just sticky all right bottom Cranky's piece remove there we go at this point I am pretty well disassembled", "QY8uIYID7UI": "hello everyone I just changed the oil on my Yamaha r3 and for the oil I chose Yama loop yes it was recommended by Yamaha so you can see on the oil cap it says Yama loop and it's recommended by Yamaha I chose to listen to them you can choose other brands like cost casserole or anything else but I think our loop is a solid choice also the filter I used was a K&N or 1 because formas is great and another reason is that he has a bolt on it which makes it easier to unscrew it and then screw it back in so the original is not going to have a bolt on this I recommend you get a tool special tool for you to be able to unscrew it because pretty hard if you don't have the tool so yeah other than that let's get right into the topic of the video ok so after you're done changing your oil you're going to want to reset the trip and the oil light so it doesn't beep and then tell you like to change it if you already did and if you don't do that you know the 3000 mark after you change your first oil it's not going to register so you have to reset it so what you want to do is after you put the t starter in you're going to want to press this SEL button until you get to keep pressing it skip all this until you get to the oil and trip part and after you get there you hold the reset button for one second until it starts blinking once it starts blinking you want to hold it for three seconds there there you have it now it's zero miles per trip and your next oil change will be in 3,000 miles I hope you guys enjoyed the video and found it helpful for any other suggestions please leave a comment and make sure to subscribe thank you", "Cuqz94b_-rg": "hi I'm Mike and welcome to

I'm gonna sing myself to sleep with this one so here goes [Music] down by the Southie guard my love and I did me she passed the her sadly garden with little snow-white feet she bid me take love easy as the lead growing on the tree but I being young and foolish with her would gnaw the grain in a field by my love and I did stand and on my Lee in shoulder she laid her snow white she bid me take life easy as the grass grows on the Weir's but I was young and foolish and now full of tears [Music] down by the savvy I love did me she passed the shoddy garden with his little snow-white feet she made me take love easy as the lead grown on the tree but I be young with the grain but I was young and foolish and now I am full of tears oh what a pretty song that is so let me show you the chords first they're simple basic chords you have C you have a a minor F and a G and in the tabs you have a seat the E minor shape but you should also know those so you could play this by simple two strums per chord and it would sound fine by and but what I did was a simple arpeggio plucked the two outer strings here and then three two [Music] oh excuse me so you get the idea and then the the tabs you kind of have to follow along but it's you start on the C string and it's open and then - and then these three for the C and then what I did I [Music] think I'm falling asleep so enjoy it", "MpJPnC-vBYU": "our one quick back with another video going out for a ride I just did a lawyer change cuz my gearbox became kind of clunky so I put am saw 10 W 40 synthetic I had yeah more Lube in there and it's only been a thousand miles with the yama lube but it wasn't synthetic it was just 10 w 40 i was just trying something out so let's see now how the gearbox behaves hopefully is not the clutch the clutch is not slipping but it's been acting weird like going into first gear you guys be the judge as well you guys help me out I'm waiting for the bike to warm up like I said just did the oil change I only put three quarts and them and the oils in between the lines because that's what it says on the manual to keep it in between not at the hide line I always thought that you had to put it on the High Line but I guess not it says in the manual in between so that's what I did now for the first time let's see how how the bike responds I changed the headlights back to the factory ones because the other ones I couldn't really see at night so I have to do some modifications to put some LEDs on I really don't want to go with HIDs because I don't want all those wires sticking out you know this clutch basket is making a lot of noise see I can hear it and when I press in the clutch it goes away [Music] [Music] [Music] all right she goes into neutral fine I don't know shift kind of a little bit hard but they said sometimes you gotta break the oil in so let's see what happens hopefully you got enough oil like I said don't worry was in between I could smell the oil now cuz some of the oil fell on the exhaust even if you clean it off you're gonna smell it further awhile I want to go this way because this light takes long when it's a bike it doesn't read the weight of the bike [Music] so I'm gonna just go around the garage I mean the garage the gas station he I don't need guys cuz I put gas last night I was out at the Syracuse Street races yesterday I didn't race but a couple other people raised and I thought that I was recording but I wasn't I wasn't recording no audio [Music] [Music] I also want to see how my quick shifter works because my quick shifter Dynojet quick shifter was working good and then about three weeks ago when you go into fifth gear and we're going to neutral first and then go into gear I don't know what was that all about fun let's see now with the with this you are you if this oil helps out I've heard good reviews about Hansel and I'm wanted to bear review so let's see but it's going into neutral smoothly which I like but that clutch basket or something she's making a lot of noise when I pressing the clutch it goes away man but I hate that song [Music] [Music] so far so good besides the clutch noise while the culture basket at the collection [Music] I hate these bugs that get on your visor [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah I don't know what what is going on with that collection oyster I'm gonna have to just change the clutch or take it to the shop or something [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that's where the races were as last night right across the street there when that", "Ej7cS5R1O3Y": "guys I'm going to make a short video on how to service your Yamaha r1 this is the 5 V Y model 2006 and the way I'm going to do is I basically start with the spark plugs as the engine is that cold at the moment so I'm going to start with that so first thing we're going to do is ok so to start off we were going to remove the seat you've got one atom book there and you've got another one just there so go ahead and remove those put the bolts off for this just that comes off just pull it off and put it aside and then we're going to remove this side panel here start with this side little screw right here at the top sort of that put that side and this just slides back slide it back like so which you don't break any of the tabs in there and pull this out and slide it off so you got this tab here over there slides in from down there so put this aside then you've got this 10 mil nut here go ahead and loosen that off take this off again as you have then you do the exact same on the other side and after you've done that we've got to come over here at the top then what we're going to do with them remove this Allen not from the top of the tank go ahead and then edita this you've got the nut up your tank should be free to move up to reveal your air filter the once you've done that just then use something to prop up the tank and you can start removing the air for our as it is like this why it gets a bit tight around here what I prefer to do them remove the tank completely just to get out of the way we give you give you a lot more space so what we're going to do now is remove all these pipes and electrical bits from underneath I'm going to do is underneath the tank we're going to start moving some of these pipes out of the way we'll start off with this vapor vaporize and pry this down do that and then just try yank this off okay all right so let's come off then you've got an electrical switch press it and pull then you've got this um this fuel line here obviously you've got you're gonna need a pair of pliers this is just bit here weld all that up here so press it pull it down and just try and twist this off going to get a bit of fuel fall out of there so try to have a right there Josh you look back and and you know you've got another electrical switch over here so we're going to go to the other side and carry on guys so then you come to this side and you've got another fuel fuel line here so what you're going to do is press here and on these clips both sides press as hard as you can and just just pull it off expect a bit of fuel to come out of this one as well as you can see so I have a rag be ready and then you've got another electrical clip right next to it single gel Vaughn just press and just pull this down and there you have it the tank is uh basically ready to remove I'm going to do is I'll come back over here I remove this last bolt Dallenbach the five mil I believe don't screw that once you got out of the fruit should just pull up and should be like so put that side guy so now you've got the tank out the way you've got a lot more space to play with so what I'm going to do is remove the air for our guide and remove this clip and what we're going to do is move all the screws all the way around the airport once you've removed all the screws all the way around the air photo box got another one right in here you've got this little rubber thing that you just twist and you pull off and you've got another screw there go ahead and remove that as you will remove the screw from india garden to pull the cover off put that side hand you have your F over here this just pops off just inspector as you can see it's quite dirty put that aside and now we're going to do is try to access our spark plugs through here as opposed to moving the radio out of the way and accessing it from the front now we're going to do is um loosen all six of these Allen bolts and loosen them off and the whole bottom of the fo our box should come loose and then all you have remaining is um this pipe here just pinch little pinch thing they pull it off from there and another one on the side there as you can see go ahead and remove those and we'll remove the whole bottom of the air war box also this is where I'm at now and once you go there for a box out of the way and you come here you've got this little piece here with this little ring here that goes into there and you kind of go all these clips inside you kind of just pull this out and out of the way and you have a space through there you can probably see one of the koala facts down there and then still you're gonna have to move this piece here out the way which holds the CPU in there from underneath here and you just disconnect the harness which is quite tough once you've got that the way you pull this rubber sheet back and then you you can just about see the Koala packs one two three and four but it's really tight apparently this is the this is the way you're supposed to do it according to the manual but I can see why people choose to go in from the other end from the radiator end just pull the radio back and access the core packs from there because this really does seem really tight and I don't think I'll be able to do it from from this direction so we're going to check the function of these butterflies to see if they are alright can't seem to do it manually on this bike so I'm going to go ahead and turn the ignition on and see how it goes that kind of seemed alright they all seem to be in sync so let's see how it goes by them as you can see I've kind of given up trying to access the spark plugs through the top over there and so now it's become a fairing off job so I've just removed this side fairing and what I'm going to try and do with them there's one of the radiator bolts you got this another one on the other side so I'm going to try and loosen these off take these off and see how much how much I can move the radiator forward how much play these pipes have I really don't want to remove these or coolant pipes and obviously then it's going to be a coolant job as well and and anyway then obviously you've got your color packs through the up and try and access them through there and let's see how this goes okay so far the ten move off okay then go to the other side and do the same okay so I'm on the right-hand side now and this side it seems to be just an Allen bolt I've loosened it off and you can just about make out the fourth cylinder there the court the coil pack but yet I've only I've only gained about an inch or so to play so I'm gonna have to start removing a few more things to try and get enough space so I can access the coil packs guys so I managed to do a take off cylinder for coil pack obviously that's the easier one the first one in this side let's see if we can take out the spark plug and see what the condition is and take it from there guide them and see I've just about managed to get the head of my half-inch onto the extension which is down the socket there and just about nice to get some turns happening I have no idea how I'm gonna even access the the other cylinders in the middle most likely we'll have to remove these I think this is what's stopping the radio from going any more forward so I might have to drop the coolant and let's see how it goes guys I'm not just about managed to unscrew the spark plug so I'm going to get my trusty little magnet down there see if I can pull out the plug and then have it pass nice looking very grimy so there you go that's one done let's see if we can go and get the rest okay so coming back to the left side of cylinder one cylinder one is not the issue I've got that I've got that ratchet in there and less common or fine and this little were a little port here is quite handy actually I might be able to just get to the middle two core packs from here because you can see I can just about get my hand on the corvax from here so let's see how that goes okay so I managed to get cylinder one out as well there we go don't know why I don't know if these spark plugs have ever been no removed I don't know all this Rusty's around the outside the but anyway let's see how it goes if I can get the middle two out without having to drop the coolant and move the radiator hoses out of the way then that would be a proper result so let's see how it goes as you can see guys I've got a cylinder two on there now and only because I've got this stubby little flexi ratchet and you can see I'm just about altima hand there just getting a turn in there and so that looks like it's coming through and let's see if we can get cylinder three up and if we can that means them I didn't have to drop any coolant that would great guide them as you can see I've just about managed to get a ratchet onto the year cylinder 3 which was by far the most difficult I'm pretty certain this would not have been possible without this stubby little ratchets it I've got and go ahead and find the spark plug and if I can do so that would mean I've managed to remove all four spark plugs without having to remove any radiator hoses and so let's see how this goes so cook the third cylinder loose taking the ratchet out now I'm just doing it by hand this was by far the most difficult cylinder because of that if you can see this this thing here is right in the way and but I think I'm almost done what a free piece ratchets it down I might up to something separate it before I take it out because it's really tight down there oh just about mine should get this out so I put my magnet down there and try to fetch that spark plug by them so I managed to get the last of final worm spark plug out and they're all looking similar so which is a which is a good finger suppose I don't know exactly what they mean I'm going to check up from what this coloration means but none of them had any other stains or anything like that so that was good so yeah so I managed to take them all out I might just do a quick compression test and then go ahead and replace them with the new spark plugs advise them so I put all four plugs up I don't know why all these bits all rusty and that and I don't know if that's normal but the actual plugs itself I'm quite happy with them because they all look more or less identical they've all been burning identically and so there you go and go ahead and replace them with the new ones and take it from there guys so go ahead and compare your new plugs with the old ones make sure they are the right size I never think these are CR 9 e KS for this Yamaha r1 2004 2005 6 5 dy model and the basic agai so what we're going to do is start replacing the spark plugs we're going to start off with the ones in the middle because those are the most difficult to get to and we're trying them just pop this spark plug through the top into cylinder free and if you can just about see it happening we're going to just line up and just drop it in there thread first and as you saw had dropped in then I'm going to get the extension and drop that through if you can see I'm just going to drop that into a cylinder sending the next extension and try to clip them all into place and start ratcheting away okay so where we've done the middle - it was quite tough but it's doable and now we're here in the cylinder for last one just talking down the spark plug of hand-tightened already we're going to give you a couple of turns and and then we should be done going to put the coil packs on and then that's so complete okay guys so I'm I've replaced all the coil packs and the coil pack leads I'll pull the fairings back on put the tank back on connected everything up so this is a moment of truth let's see if we can start her up let's see smell ah everybody hold on without my cane get it done Oh help me", "yiH0pFQs5d0": "[Music] the pump was great gypsy jazz style different ways to do it this is my own personal favorite keep a really relaxed wrist be able to flop it about because all the movements come in from the elbow can use thumb or finger for extra volume it's an up and a down followed by another down except it's not up and down it's a circular movement it's like throwing a stone up it doesn't stop at the top falls straight back down so it's straight that down and with the left hand only fretting hand at the moment of hitting the chord just relax a string slightly so it's the difference between letting the ring and letting the mute gives that just a casual feel so slowly [Music] with all movements practice slowly build up speed eventually you find it easy to do faster rather than slower have fun", "ZkoDH0CIwyo": "hey guys so I thought I'd do a video when you already kind of more than half way into it I'm gonna replace my temperature thermostat valve thing it's gone bad so pretty much what I did was I took off this 2007 Yamaha r1 us so it took off the bottom fairing and then here's the the coolant is all drained and not was right here so just pull back I had so drooping a little bit and then took that fairing off took this side scaring off so we saw this fairing is off and then I removed that guy and drain the coolant so cooling was drained and then I started taking apart the bikes in this case took off the rear seat then I went and took off the side plastic pieces here one screw here the same on the other side and then there's the center screw for this guy that I removes there and then it's still attached so unless you have to unscrew these guys they're right and connects to this guy here unscrew that and then that's pretty much it and lift it up mount it you can either use a string and attached to the back or whatever way you want to do it so from there then I could see where the thermostat fits just like to stay so this guy right here this big plastic piece right there and it had two screws right better from this side so this guy here and this guy here and took one of them out already so just some screws I can get it out so just I just cuz it comes off but you have a five and then a ten alan keyes five and then the socket sets of ten so that there's only two of them one on the left side one on the right side and then kind of wiggle jiggle jiggle and then it comes out the thermostat fits right in there in this case there is a hole on the top also tells you the reed in the valley that it opens at so it says 71 Celsius but that dot right there that you see that has to be facing when I removed it it is facing up right here so something to keep in mind has to be facing up so I'm go ahead and installed a new one and then just reverse everything back and then put in the coolant close the nut at the bottom fill up the radiator and then fill up the extra forget the name tour flow okay thank you", "wcAFaiLt0Pc": "[Music] hey guys so today we'll be making a Hubble infusion oil and I will be using the crock-pot method which requires putting the oil and the herbs in the crock-pot for 8 hours under warm setting if you don't have a crock-pot you can always use the traditional method of a mason jar and shaking it up and waiting for it to infuse 4 to 6 weeks and I'm using 7 herbs you don't have to use the 7 that I'm using any of your choice is great I'm also using coconut oil which I've found to be the best when it comes to infusion the crock-pot method is not only faster it's more efficient it is distributed evenly which allows for the oil to absorb nutrients from the herbs more evenly the result is an oil that is not only rich but also highly fragrant and habitually I add vitamin E oil which acts as a preservative", "_jRjov6zSb0": "what's going on gypsy man well it's been a while since I posted a video I figured I let everybody know what I've been up to I don't think uh you know sometimes I get tired of watching people's videos on them ridin but check this out this is what I'm doing when I'm not riding I've been working on bikes for about 13 years now and this my friends is the 2004 Yamaha r1 that I had in some of my other videos this is what it looks like right now the person that I sold it to started having some clutch slipping issues which we thought was a clutch slipping issue close brother of mine but what it actually was was upon further review we change the clutch twice still slipping in fifth and sixth gear so we ended up doing what what I wanted to avoid was having to take the engine out and cracking the case so we ended up taking the engine out cracking the case see a box of parts here always important if you're going to take your bike apart label your parts put them in separate bags separate bags everything is a separate bag it's a gasket label your parts but I what we ended up doing is that's Papa Legba she's been up for a little while he's been up a leg by a leg why so put this gasket over here ended up cracking the case is some of the parts going to get organized here some of the parts that came out of the engine believe it or not this is actually looking really neat the other day I like to stay organized but we have our gaskets we have our old transmission you have our shift drum we have some other parts from gaskets inside of here is another transmission ended up having to buy two of them this one them that was sent to me I ended up being the wrong transmission so this is the heart of the bike as we know it right now get rid of that I always told myself that I didn't work on engines I usually did everything else but the engine but I got my hands on a a balsa that needed an engine swap and I changed that out without a problem like I said I've been working on bikes for 13 years I'm not a professional mechanic you can take that out let's throw this over here because it's kind of wet still I'm not a professional mechanic but I love motorcycles I love taking bikes apart just as much as I love riding them so we ended up splitting the case to get to the transmission what you see here some miscellaneous parts well actually they're not miscellaneous I can actually remove that to try to use that part as you take parts off your bike put them in bags so you know where they go and not just put parts aside thinking you won't remember where they go put them in bags organize them you will forget once you got to put this back together but I know this bike like heart by heart and um I never had a problem putting things back on it but don't think that I don't for one second use a diagram order service menu which really doesn't tell you how to put the taken bike apart or put it back together it does do well showing you what parts need to be replaced as far as gaskets it'll tell you if it's new and it will tell you the torque specs in a more organized I think with the pictures it shows you the torque and what bolt goes where but the Haynes manual is invaluable gotta have a Haynes manual for your book for your bike that's what the generator stated cover it goes starter that's a gear shaft gear lever shaft that's a sensor so what I want to do in this video of this showing you how beautiful the bite looks inside I still got to clean up this side so I could put a new gasket on there it's not in gasket you have to have the semi dry gasket put on there I only use long yama lube no excuse me Yama bond number four not number five you know my bond number four to put the two halves together the other half it's over here the other half is over here and we'll have that cleaned up and I'll put that back on I'm waiting for parts still it's always a good idea when you split in two halves of the bike and once you're in the bike there's gaskets on a lot of these parts on the on the main drive shaft inside the case where the pipes go through the case to get to the water oil pump and I some of these are these bolts are torqued down use red loctite inside of the engine red lock type do not use blue loctite inside of the engine this is where the clutch basket connects to the bike this is nothing one of the uh I don't know the name exactly of what it is exactly but this is the main shaft which delivers the power to the rear wheel this is a then they're all they all have gears and they all have a certain sequence and this is part of the gearing system where it actually engages as you shift the gears and if you look here you'll see the shift drum has a star on it there's a hook right there and a spring system that is a groove here for neutral and it stays inside of these grooves which you see right here the star in between star that's where the gears engage and as they engage this is your shift lever as they engage these are forks shift Forks or some people call them dogs they move each of these gears to the left or the right there's another dog down low where there's one is the center dog or shift fork which moves the gears the same way down low left or right which gives you your first its second your third your fourth your fifth and your sixth gear okay one of the gaskets that had to be replaced the oil seal that's your crank that's your time and chain what you have here are different channels that allow oil to lubricate these parts inside you see little channels for example okay that's where your sprocket your front sprocket goes with deliver the drive to the rear wheel this is a sensor and this is a 2004 yama or r1 so I want to show you this because if you do work on bikes and most of us do work on our own bikes when it comes time for you to do something like this what happened was this bike has 20,000 miles on it plus wear and tear from doing the type riding I used to do and the new owner learning how to ride a bike and this being his first bike I also want to say that it is also the result of shift of clutchless upshifting no down shifts which I hate when it happens unless you have Auto blipper which I'm not going to pay the money for unless your bike already has it so what went on the transmission if you look closely you'll see that there are slots inside of some of the sprockets there's a slot inside of this sprocket and there is a mail-in that goes into that slot which engages then the gear that you're selecting okay these dogs slide that gear into engagement or this way or that way on this side and I believe this is in neutral okay we are in neutral Co the gears spinning okay it just slides back and forth and the male end of this side or this gear will go into the female side of this skier which has slots okay these gears interlock with each other and when they round off you get some terrible the gears will slip out of gear you'll be able to get into the gear but you'll slip out of it so we were slipping out of fifth and we're slipping out of six so this is this transmission actually came from a 2005 Yamaha r1 and I got very lucky this transmission was absolutely beautiful it was perfect look at look at look at the angle and the edge on those gears all these gears look like this on the main drive and they also looked like that and let's get around to it if you see down low down there the teeth or say the metal end of that gear are just as beautiful as the top gear so I got very lucky very lucky just a beautiful transmission so I'm going to show you how to my fact let me do everybody a favor I will take this out in my next video and I will show you how to change the transmission in this bike alright before we do that let me just point out some things once you split the halves this part this part the main drive of the transmission come straight out you just pull it out but you have to be careful because everything on there is is basically just placed on top of each other on this shaft so this will slide out these first parts until you get to a certain or circlip that holds on other gears but most these parts will slide out and that goes for this shaft and it goes for the main drive shaft once you split the case you're right here but I'm going to show you what needed to be done before we even got to split in the case in another video in part two part one once you get the case open you can pull this right out then you have to go down here on the other side of the engine and this happens to be for most bikes there's a clip here you take that off and there's a washer and that's your gear lever rod it pulls straight out it's connected here as a spring spring and this is on the Yamaha but this is what most manufacturers do then you have to take selector Drum Off but before that you have to take this off which holds the gears in place it's just a screw they're all red loctite so there's a little resistance these bolts here hold the rods that hold the forks the shift Forks on there once you unscrew these screws you can pull that out then you will take out the dogs you'll take them out then you go down here this is for the upper shaft same thing pull the rod out the center rod down here will drop down you unscrew these bolts then you take these bolts and you put them in these holes which acts as a press against the engine so you can pull this straight out without a problem that is all it takes to change the transmission in your bike then you replace the parts or the gears that you want to place I replace the whole shafts and all the gears I didn't just select which gear I need it I'm also put this one because this is a more fresh transmission and it looked way better than the old one all right you can put new gaskets here we're going to get to that in the next video let me show you what the damaged transmission looks like and why your gear after changing the clutch while they're still slipping out just walk over here to the bench so what happened if you look here you see we're shining that's supposed to be square okay if you look here you'll see that it's actually broken off right there I have some worse examples I'm sure in here alright see how this slides that slides because the forks or the dogs slide this and this is what changes the gears only this moves inside there there's only let me see three components that slide in these shafts now look at this one this was some of the worst damage it's all rounded off so when you engage the gear and you hit the throttle boom it's gonna slide out you've lost fifth gear you've lost fifth gear and as this wore down and this is a good one too you can see that this broke off and started rounding off when these engaged engaged in a positive way okay this is the main shaft didn't look as bad but you can see that it started started getting shiny started rounding off okay so let me give you example of what I mean let me grab a pen real quick let me give you a quick illustration what it should look like not so much of the angle and then you have the other side which engages okay these two will meet when the gear is selected they come together it's not so much of that angle and you have a very positive connection let me show you what's happening now and what happened this skier rounds off breaks off looks like that starts to round off starts to round off this side as a result of that rounds off as well when you engage those two when the powers is that when the throttles apply did it slip out what you have is a not so positive connection and you have the slippage that's what happened I took this trend I took these transmissions out and I had metal parts all over the place and I also want you to show you some scarring that's on the gears if I can get a good picture of it on this video but if you look closely you see scars it's almost as if a cat just started scratching at the gears so we had some bad scarring on the gear and I can't believe this first okay don't quote me on that this one didn't look as bad I guess this is more heavy-duty will say but it did have the rounding of the mailing of the gear that goes inside the female which inside the female will start the round off itself so you don't have a very positive connection some of these gears start off as being round but they end up chipping and you lose the connection with your transmission so if you have a very bad slippage issue and you've changed a question it's still slipping more than likely you need a new transmission something in there needs to be changed I'm not sponsored by them but I will let you know that I used a BAE to find these parts and I got very lucky like sometimes you do so I'll show you how to put the transmission back together and you don't have to be afraid to do it you need a service man you need to need two tools if you don't have the tools or service manual or the guts and the know-how don't try it at home so this is gypsy man and I have to say peace out", "1YSLlxHKJsQ": "what if day is triggered the need of today I'm going to show you guys how to replace your clutch plates if you plot your slipping at high rpms not fully engaging up most awfully engaging it's not fully disengaging you want to try to adjust your clutch cable and see if that helps if you still go to you know crack open the throttle really hard and the I p.m. rpms just skyrocket and I can't talk this morning the RPM skyrocket and the bike doesn't go anywhere it's because your clutch is slipped out Yamaha's are really well known for having clutch problems a lot of people swear by the OEM clutch plates and whatnot but you know if they're always having problems with their clutch plates then why would we use them so I picked up this this clutch kit from sixty performance parts it's got I'll show you well it's got in it here we go sixty performance parts and it's got your steel plates like this and then it's got fiber plates the fiber plates are usually what go out on your bike these just get worn down the fire pieces they no longer grab anymore but you know since I'm in there I decided I might as well replace the Spears - so they're going on there I also got a new set of Springs here - for the clutch basket so the first thing you got to do is you got to soak all of this in the same oil that you're using in the bike and that for me is going to be na maloom full synthetic oil this is by far the best that Yamaha I mean Yamaha makes their own oil it's going in a Yamaha might as well use it kind of thing so we got things that we're going on so all of these pieces I got my been out here to soak them in and I'm gonna clean it out a little bit better and then soak them you should soak them for at least three hours I'm just going to go ahead and soak them overnight just to be safe just be easier and then I'll end up replacing the clutch tomorrow so now that you've let your clutch plates kind of soak overnight I got the oil absorbed within the fibers next thing you're going to do is you're going to take off your lower paneling portion which is super easy let's have the speed bolts pop them and you're good to go and then you're going to want to go ahead you're going to want to join our drain the oil so I got my oil catch pan here and right here's the drain plug you're going to want to go ahead and drain this out all right so this drain plug is going to be a 17 millimeter this is kind of hard to do with one hand because I've been tightening it earlier oils coming out there we go oil actually looks pretty good I don't see any shavings I will say any particles I don't see anything that's not supposed to be there so that's good one thing that really helps I don't have on this bike because this is not um this wasn't my bike when I the last oil change was done is a magnetic drain plug that'll actually catch any debris or anything like that in your case those are really nice to have I how it's just picking them up they're really cheap so I'll be installing one back on the bike when I'm done so we're going to go ahead we're going to let this drain out one thing we are going to do which will help the drain better because your engine is like a vacuum we're going to go ahead and we're going to take the plug off as well and on an r1 you can just take like this and a standard wrench and set this down in here and do it this way there we go pull the plug off and that will just help make sure the system gets fully drained like we need it to still draining down there I'm just going to go ahead and leave that off entirely as you can see the oil is is no longer in this window and this right here is your clutch cover so we're going to go ahead and we're going to take this off starting with this clutch protector little bracket here and then we're just going to go around it and take off the rest of it alright so now that I got that off you can see that the clutch cable is now you're now able to see it right here I'm actually going to go ahead and try and loosen this up so I can get the clutch cable out I can figure out righty-tighty lefty-loosey here alright so I went ahead and loosen this bolt all the way down and that gives me a lot of free play here in this lever which is what I need so now I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to take the clutch cover off I do suggest using a ratchet style because these need to be torqued to spec when you put them back on you don't to worry about this when you take them off let just know that you're going to need a torque wrench and I also suggest using some sort of a little bit of an extender because this will keep your ratchet away um it won't scratch anything so I do suggest that and this is a 5 millimeter so we're going to go ahead and start taking these off actually I might need a bigger extension I'm going to get a bigger extension because right here it's gonna be a little tight I don't want to scratch anything alright so I went ahead and crack them all off to the point where I could just rotate them out by hand so that's what I'm going to do now and then we're going to pull this whole thing off I'm not 100% sure these were torque to spec to begin with because I think it's seven and a half foot pound or something like that and these I could based almost rotate from hand some of them to begin with so I don't know if that's just because they've been on the bike for a while or if they were never to expect to begin with not really sure but I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna take this off alright so all the bolts are out I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to try to pull this off it's pretty on there pretty good I don't see any other bolts so I'm really not sure why it's not coming off you get this off and honestly I don't know if this has anything to do with it if it was just the force of me taking the cable out that broke it loose but I have it broke loose there we go just comes right off there's the cover inside looks pretty good nothing really wrong there the gasket is like non-existent though what the heck the gasket has entirely deteriorated that's crazy there's no gasket on either side I don't think the clutch has ever been replaced actually I think this is the first time this has ever been opened up that's crazy Mike's got close to the 30,000 miles on it I don't think the clutch has ever been replaced all right well I'm going to go ahead and and take the clutch basket off pressure plate which is this right here you do not want to use these Phillips screws you will strip them use a I think it's a 10 millimeter on the outside all right so it is a 10 millimeter and these are Springs on the other side so as you start to loosen them the springs are going to expand so this is going to take a while so instead of recording this basically just take all these bolts out and you'll be good to go all right so I got all the screws out and these are long and a pain in the ass you want to take your time so you don't strip them and then the spring sits just like this and the screws down in there to hold the spring to create pressure on the plate so now can remove the pressure plate there we go so you want to take careful note of where everything is because you put it back the same way and let's see here so here's the pressure plate this looks good no marring on this the groove looks good I'm gonna go ahead and I'm just going to set this over here or over here somewhere wait out of the way and then another rag to stack the plates with you just want to be careful removing them you don't want to damage anything looks like this fiber is pretty pretty worn as well and they have some uneven wear on them too not really sure what that means you know this is a lot easier with two hands there we go when you get you a last little plate there's going to be this wire that wraps around the outside um just unclip it and then to get the wire out the easiest thing to do is to just take and bend the little kink in the wire back out and then pull it up and out just like so put that way and save it now those last place will will lift out really easy all right so here's what other plates look like out here's what the inside looks like if you have any debris or anything like that clean it out like I got a little bit of muck right here and then we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna go set the rest of our plates back in on it left soaking in oil you really just need to soak the fiber plates but I went ahead and soaked them both and you'll notice that the first fiber is smaller than the rest so that's the one that goes on first and then another steely so let's go ahead and start putting these on put this right here all right all right so hopefully you can see this but there are actually little grooves that this sits down in so you don't want it sitting up on your steel plate like this you want down in the groove and then you tighten it and you can see right here I bet my cotter pin back the other direction so it can't go anywhere and go ahead and wipe off some of the grime for my fingers I got in there alright guys so we went it did a head the when I went ahead and did was I have my Springs in and then I put the bolts in now I'm going to tighten them down and they need to be - I think believe it's set on a half foot-pounds torque if that is not correct I will correct that in the description and you want to do it in a cross pattern so right now I'm just kind of tightening them down and then I'm going to come and get at them with the torque wrench but you saw how far these Springs were seated before so I'm gonna go ahead and just get the springs seated alright so I got everything tightened down everything's tightened how it should be next step is going to be to go ahead and replace the clutch cover let me go ahead and I'm just going to clean the outside of this all right so I do have a new gasket as well so I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna get that all right so here's the new gasket I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to fit it sitting up on here and then we're gonna go ahead and replace the clutch cover no I got one side in Nice the other side's not sitting quite as nice like when I torque it down though it'll it'll pop back in we'll try that if not be able to get to pull it back off and play with it some more you", "iAY87FKziXg": "[Music] one two three four a minor one two three four and four one two three four n g one two three four end on the a minor okay so a minor has got the three essential notes of what a c and e think of it as ace okay three essential notes but the ukulele we have four strings which means one of those three notes will be repeated doubled in this case it would be the what the a and the f chord has got what f a c and one of those notes is going to be repeated so we got the f the a and the c you're right it's the a that's repeated so the g chord has g b and d so one of those notes is repeated which one is that we got g d g so g is repeated okay so how do we make it interesting let's break up the block chords so this is what i'm gonna do go ahead and keep playing it i'm gonna play this on the piano now let's do an a minor ready one and two and three and four and one and two three changes one two three change to a minor [Music] let's see what else we can do take a look at that here's what we could do on the piano we're going to invert the chords so it looks slightly different yeah it's going to be like this i'm going to count to four and on the ukulele you could just strum or play along we're all going to be together on this okay so the piano i'm just going to use my pinky all right and then my middle or index finger and my thumb ready one and two and three and four and [Music] one two three changed [Music] okay so actually that is uh there's two different ways you could do on the piano in a whole lot of other ways as well so i just mentioned briefly the left hand uh pinky index and thumb and then you choose a different register different parts of the piano to do this change inverted and then there's different chord shapes and i'll show that on the ukulele now if you see here it's the same four strings but but for the ukulele depends on if you have high g or low g so if you have low g ukulele you could take it out now and compare if you've not plucked before i would recommend that you just take out your your thumb straighten your right thumb make sure it's straight i call it a hitchhiker's thumb and you just for the a minor chord just come down [Music] okay just like that make sure every time you it's straight so that when you pluck it it lands on the next string and just stops okay if you're on the piano you could join us playing those chords that i just showed you especially if you have the handout or you could just do a low a a low f and a low g all right so let's do that what i'm suggesting is because one of the notes is doubled okay because we have four strings and you only need three notes i'm going to show you to alternate between a minor and the other a minor you could use i like to use my middle finger for the a minor and then my pinky on the third fret that way i could easily move to the f and then put my pinky down and then i would switch to the g and for the last g what i need to do is stretch and put my pinky on the fifth fret so let's hear how it sounds for the high g ukulele okay count to four and we just keep playing the chord over and over again until i count to four and then we go to the next chord okay one and two and three and four and [Music] one two three four and f one two three four and g one two three four and a minor you have a low g it sounds different here's what it sounds like so go ahead and we'll play together again and this the low g you'll see it's these notes indicated below here below the tab ready one two three four [Music] one two three four and f [Music] one two three four and g one two three four and a okay all right so i'm sure giving you all the tools before we jam now the last thing to do is there are so many different plug patterns and this is what i teach in my pluck classes all my finger style classes trying to give you all these tools so that your your plucking hand most of the time is your right hand your right fingers will have a mind of their own for example let's try the first one the first one will sound like this of course this is on a low g so if you have a high g it sounds a little bit different one and two and three and four and so you could do this with just your thumb make sure it's straight or you could use your your four fingers thumb index middle ring finger and then the second one let's look at the second one second one is like this one and two and three and four in okay so if you're on the piano you could follow this on the piano uh or any other instrument and let's go to the third one third one gets a bit complicated because we're changing the the chord shape in the middle of a pluck pattern that always makes it more complicated so let me slow down for this one one and two and three and four and one and two and three and four and [Music] okay so that was the third one and let's go to the last one the last one again we change chord shape in the middle they're both a minor one and so one and two and three and four and so these are just four that you could choose from but there's a lot more okay so let's go to the next one so the song i like us to do is ride on it was released in 1984 and the song structure is very simple it's verse 1 followed by a very short chorus verse 2 followed by a short chorus and to hear what it sounds like those of you that could uh read the tab or the notes you could play it on your instrument otherwise you could try any of those pluck patterns or strum the a minor chord okay i'm gonna count and i'm gonna do a combination of um plucking the melody as well as uh trying to accompany at the same time so slowly one and two and three and four and one and two and three and four three four one two one two three four one and two sorry start from g again ready and one and two and three and four and one and two and three and four and one and two and three and four and okay so one more time one two ready go [Music] true [Music] notice there's quite a bit of syncopation and tied notes into the next measure which makes it a little bit tricky the introduction some of you would love to play the introduction that christy moore does is really beautiful so i'm going to play it here and and you could either play the chords or follow and pick out the bits okay so one and two and three and four and one and two and three and four and one two three four one g one more time two ready and g a minor okay so i think we're ready to jam okay all right so this is a song sheet you could jam along with this um and notice we have this bit okay so let's do this ready one and two and three and four [Music] and [Music] i think the song she's not exactly correct but i mean right chord placement but it's good enough one ready the finest horse i've ever seen standing sixteen one or two with eyes wild and green and you right the horse so well hands light to the touch i could never go with you no matter how i wanted to so now you could strum in the chorus so let's employ some of that altered chords you know the two zero zero zero and then two zero zero three that we did on the a minor one two ready go when you ride into the night without a trace run your claw along my cut one last time i turned to face an empty space where you used to lie and look for the smile to light the night through the teardrop in my eyes [Music] no matter how i wanted to last time right on see you i [Music] okay so that was christy moore and what you could do we could do is let's we're going to now experience playing along with this and not seeing the words and see if you could know when to switch the chords and do whatever you want i'll just do a little bit of this this is my group the chocolate factory and lower historic lower meals and before way before the pandemic [Music] no matter how i wanted [Music] could right know this was in the key of a minor but the news is that actually um christy moore did not sing it in this key so if you want to hear the original let me ask you to guess what key it is i might tell you what the key is we have to figure out what are the two other chords okay so if we know this is a minor f and g how are you going to guess what are the the the other chords if i tell you i'll play a little bit and you're going to guess what key it's in using your ears right on is one of those let me have you guess another one okay all right the finest horse [Music] i've ever seen i'm gonna give one more one last one for you to check and i'm gonna play a little bit somewhere else on the clip okay requires a skill in listening so that's part of um music isn't it and we're gonna go to the next part which is to look at how you figure out what the other chords were figuring out the key is one thing but figuring out the chord so this is where i'm gonna take us to the circle of fifths so let's take a look at a minor f and g can you all find it the minors are in the inner circle can you see my cursor going around like this okay so you see the c usually i like to turn it the other way so the c is like 12 o'clock you know but here it's a little bit tilted you get a minor here so the original song we went a minor f and g now look at that some of you are visual learners and remember this shape a minor go left up turn around to the right and come back left down you see that a minor turn left up to the f skip the c and go to the g and come back down now let's look at b minor that was the first one we listened to if we go to b minor it's about three o'clock on the clock we go b minor turn left up so go to the g and come back jump over the d and come back to the a and turn to the b minor you have to turn your head a bit to see b minor g and a now i think somebody got that and now let's go to the c minor can you find the c minor c minor is kind of like nine o'clock we do the same thing go c minor go to the left up to the a flat jump over the outer circle to the b flat come back to the c minor so the song will always be in that order okay that or the chord order now let's look for e minor where's e minor it looks like e minor is about two o'clock okay so we're going to do the same thing so it's going to be e minor go left up to the c jump over to the d and come back down to the e minor all right so this is one way uh to use a circle of fifths you could quickly transpose by looking at it look at the shape and do it so you don't have to perform mental gymnastics in your head all right let's move on so i just want to give a plug about three chord thursday nancy uh does all the the wonderful creative chords and we had irish songs last week tomorrow sorry this thursday we're going to be doing chord melody arrangements so if you're into plucking and instrumental ukulele this is the time to join us and see the performances it's every week and we've been we got together brand new for uh in during the pandemic we didn't exist before that so one of my students in music theory basically posed the question i could read i could write i've learned different languages i can count uh i know numbers but but why don't i know how to read music you know do i have to be able to sing do i have to be able to play an instrument in order to be able to be musically literate so here are some definitions i think it's really great what we experienced today was we saw what's up in front of us so we played those chords and then we listened okay and then we were to play we were able to play what we heard so for me that's good enough music literacy and a lot of my piano students they they would only play what they've heard on youtube otherwise they refuse to play it whereas when i learned how to play music i had to read the notes otherwise i wouldn't know what it sounded like you know because we had only one english radio station and television station so it's an oral art so i just want to say if you could read notes if you could read tabs it's just going to be a little bit faster for you than trying to figure it out just by listening i figured out everything we did today by listening you know like because i don't have the sheet music and it took me a while to figure it out because it was in another key and i had to change it to a minor so that we could play it so what is music theory then music theory will answer your questions we'll put them into a structure so it makes sense you know and for this next course of this eight week course i'm going to be talking about the beauty of the circle of fifths how you could use it to help you with harmony and then here are some of the the courses i'm giving so the right hand side are all the courses that i'm giving you basically deal directly with me so there's some flexibility in that you know i let you attend other classes if they're offered several times a week and um if it really you know doesn't fit i could give you a credit whereas um all the ones on the left there's no refund you know you you pay it use it or lose it and i'm teaching those too so at arlington community education i'm teaching eight weeks of beginning music theory that's the first course which is how to read music all the way to melody in intervals ukulele for beginners so that's both i'm going to combine both plucking tab reading and strumming and the youth ukulele that's for um fifth to ninth graders yeah and then cambridge center for adult education it's for non-beginners so i'm gonna it's thematic so it's been five weeks what all of them are one hour in zoom um this is going to be in april and may billboard countdown beatles songs female artists and british invasion songs so how to really go in and you know the proper strums and riffs and whatever letting you know now because thursday it's the cut off day for the early bird rate after that is the normal rate and all you have to do is to register on this form and for my classes you get the recordings you get pdf handouts like this one and so you could practice during the week and you could team up with other people to practice together and on thursdays you could join us and you get to perform because i've blocked off half of the spaces for my students to use to perform because otherwise it's like a month or two months in advance sign up because i only do 10 songs every thursday and that gets recorded too so i'm seeing people improve greatly okay so this is some of the student feedback um it's really great and uh you could take a look at that later in the handout and i think that's it okay all right any questions i think we have five minutes for questions and what do you mean by classical ukulele okay classical equalizers mean we're going to do classical music like for example oh to joy is a very prime example not pop music is there a difference between plucking and thinking yeah you know i use plucking to mean finger picking and finger style mainly using your fingers individually rather than strumming yeah that's classical ukulele that's on that's on mondays at 1 30. there's a prerequisite that you already know how to read tabs and also know what pima means how to pluck with your i'm tempted to give a class called tab and pluck for people who might know already how to strum but don't know how to read tab or use the correct finger technique so if there's enough interest i would do that yeah tuesday courses starting next tuesday is music theory and we're going to be talking about harmony yes starting with so basically we're going to review music intervals and music intervals are the basis for chords because you put two you know two intervals together and you get a triad you get a chord you know because core you really need three notes so i just finished teaching a six week music theory course and some of them are here um pat patricia you're here and i know who else is here carla you're here so i started from scratch and i took them through you know notation and intervals so we're ready to tackle diatonic chords chord family yeah uh all the roman numeral numbers yeah and say what is the difference between a major seventh and a minor seventh you know and the role of dominance and i don't know we'll if you'll get to secondary dominance but but knowing chords and the functions will be able to analyze music and it's very powerful because i just showed you a very quick example of how there's a song you really want to know how to play you don't know what key it's in you know but the sheet music is in another key and you don't have a capo right and then so you could figure out and then the next step would be well i want to embellish it you know i want to add another chord to make it mine you know what extra chord can i add or it could be the opposite you know this song has 10 chords it's just too much you know how can i reduce it to the very essential chords you know which chords are necessary that you could reduce it so those people that play the piano they could figure out how to do it on the piano and hear it and if you play the ukulele or guitar or that you will try try it out because you have to be able to hear it right and if you don't have any instrument the good news is we've got the virtual piano keyboard you know there's like at least five websites and mobile apps you could download so you could kind of plunk it out and hear what it sounds like all right great question molly any other questions yes karen that's on tuesday mornings and bruce bruce does the voice coaching um individual voice coaching and the way we're gonna do next time we get enough people and that doesn't start for another two weeks is we'll have like a 50-minute class session all together and then either before or after the class you have your time spot and then you go in for your individual private lesson with with bruce unless you want to team up with another person and get double the time you know trisha did you have a question no i just wanted to say i recommend the hum and strum yeah today we had our last class and there was so much progress it's wonderful i love it when when you own your song you know you just adapt it to your voice because you know you know which range you know you know that you've got to do that so that you could sing it powerfully and then uh is beth here you you decide you know i'm going to pluck the uh i'm going to finger pick the verse and i'm going to strum the chorus part so it sounds different or catherine you decide to you know put some melodrama in your singing right to make bad moon rising really bad this is great and just be critical rather than you know this is a the holy song she i can't do anything with that i'm just gonna have to do it bite it you know right thanks ann could you repeat the early bird deadline the early bird deadline is thursday yes thursday it's 149 for eight weeks of classes and if you know any teenagers or pre-teens i'm giving uh they're doing a seven-week class and then after that it's going to be 179 the regular rate okay happy st patrick's day tomorrow that's right sherry happy st patrick's day i'm wearing my green yeah green for luck dig out the cabbage and the potatoes yeah that's right okay here's a tip about venmo and it saved me half on the service charges yes absolutely if you pay by credit card it's another 10 fee if you decide to do check another 10 feet but if it's zell or vemmo you know you don't pay for it yeah yeah okay all right well thank you for showing up and coming to this workshop i appreciate it maybe one day i'll do the i'll do the filipino song mash up with this song in the future but all right thank you bye-bye bye [Music] i see everybody [Music] so i think a lot of the time my hands my fingers were doing stuff on their own i wasn't really controlling them and this is what i want to achieve on the ukulele and the f chord [Music] and then the g [Music] down [Music] you", "_sm4eWx3lwQ": "hey everyone its June and welcome back to my channel now a lot of you have had some questions about the neem oil one of the questions that I get asked most is why it when I buy my name or even why when I have my meme oil for a certain time it gets to be a solid instead of an oil that you can just pour out now neem oil has a high melting point so it goes solid when it's cold so if your if it's cold outside if you have it in a cold part of your house it will turn to a solid like like a jelly so it turns like into it jelly lumpy you know whatever so this is what it looks like when it is solid it's almost impossible to get out you'd have to squeeze it say it's like a jelly say it's very hard to get out you can use it like this but it's much easier to use as an oil so when it coagulates it doesn't mean that it's bad it's actually good it lasts longer at lower temperatures it's just impossible to pour so if you like it at the oil consistency all you have to do is give it a little warm bath that's it not hot you do not want to run your neem oil under hot water because he destroys the active ingredients so if you want to keep the the amazing properties see how it it's all on the bottom you want to get that in here so you're going to take a nice cup a little cup and you're going to give your neem oil a nice warm map so you can leave it here for a few minutes and it should be warm and turns back into an oil so we'll come back and we'll see how this looks okay you can see seriously I shut the camera off and I checked on it it was less than 30 seconds and you can already see how it's already turning into an oil so this would be this will be a quart bath so I'll be back when it is all turns back into an oil okay so after about three to four minutes neem oil is back in its original state and it's ready to be used just keep in mind the smell what I'm gonna let you smell it smell it doesn't really smell that good if those of you who never used neem oil before please note it does have a very potent smell and if you can't deal with the smell then just dilute it with oil any other carrier oil you can use olive oil castor oil peppermint oil anything to mask the smell I kind of gotten used to it and I don't mind it at all so yeah so that's how you get your neem oil from solid to oil and if you have any other neem oil questions don't forget to leave them down below I will try to make a video answering your questions so I hope this helped you out guys and yeah and I'll see you in my next neem oil hair-growth challenge update video have a great day bye and if you're new here and you have no idea what the neem oil hair growth challenge is there are clickable links right here that you can check out and you can just check out my hair growth challenge videos and if you want to join the fun then just order your neem oil I will leave the link in the description box below and come join the challenge and grow your hair back bye guys", "C6qKcuDzp-U": "all right so this video I'm going to do my oil change flush my coolant and I'm going to replace their frame sliders you're all going to need a bike stand grab this one for 40 bucks I'll put the link I'll put the link on the description of where I got it got my face ladders got some tread lock so they don't fall off because my last one fell off just when I'm putting new ones and my oil filter which was like 12 bucks I've got a little thing for the oil filter that's adjustable never used it before so we'll see how that goes that my oil think you need about two and a quarter to fill it up with in three quarters sorry and this is the type I got JAMA Lube 1040 if you live in a hot city you probably want to use 10:30 four-stroke I heard good things about this is engine nice this was twenty-two ninety-five if you live in a hot city again it'll run your engine about 10 degrees lower and distill water to flush the radiator and I'm also going to loop my chain oh and you're going to need some Allen wrenches to take this bolts off here I have a four millimeter and I'm going to use this one for the drill which is a 5/32 it's about the same size so it's faster to take off I also forgot to mention I got a gasket for the drain plug that's about almost three bucks so let's start by taking off the face start with these piece by the way the first time I do this so far I make a few mistakes see look in addition to taking these guys off there's also some plastic things that you have to pop out all you do is push it push it in it should just come out and they look like this there's one there let's see if there's not one anymore oh that's it oh this parts off by this by the way this is a oh seven are six all right now step this part off here there's there's another one down here in front I'm going to need to wrench for down there's another one on here get to it careless another one back here there's there's going to be another one that down here so one in the front one in the back I'll continue the video after I take this off okay so I took off five of these guys for this frame for this part of the frame there's one here one on the in the front one in the back this one down here the window here and then this black part is actually part of this too so you just got to take off one of those plastic Thanks just pop it in and should just come on just put the kickstand up so it's not in the way so mine oh there's one more of those black things back here inside as well don't now the only thing that's holding it together is this the turn signal so since I don't have any of these zip ties I'm just going to put my frame up and just get it out get it out of the way all right so next the oil filters right here so it looks like we're going to have to take this bolt off and then we'll go from there okay so you gotta have remove this shifter to take that off you're going to need a six millimeter to take this part off I'm also going to take this cover to see what's just to clean up - the chain in there and see if there's any rocks and stuff and then we're going to need to take off these two screws to take this part out so you can get to the filter better and for that you're going to need a eight millimeter okay so let's do that this one it's pretty tight on there all right so it's some people like to take this part off but I'm going to try to avoid taking this off and see if I can get the cover off without taking this bolt off but in case you do want to take it off there is the line there on the inside part and there's a little dot so you want to make sure that line alliance with the dot so your so if you have it in neutral when you put it back on it'll be in neutral again all right so I'm going to take this part off now okay so now this just slide out put your push it in slides up you want to take off this Moses out as well so now that's out be careful because there's those spacers in there that you will fall out all right so this Oh so now we have the oil filter free I'm gonna take this part off now okay so I just finished taking the screws off this cap and it's two up here and one down here they're kind of a pain so if you don't want to take this off you don't have to for the oil change but like you see it's pretty dirty so I'm going to clean that up so now you have room to take off the filter and the drain plugs down here you're going to need a 17 millimeter but before I do that I'm going to take off the field put the fuel cap on the other side so it drains a lot faster alright so I just wanted to show you guys real quick where the fill cap is in case you don't know that's it right there and I'm going to take the dipstick out as well okay so I just loosened up the drain plug before that I put some newspapers and cover the exhaust so you don't get oil all over your sauce so I'm going to drain it first and that's why I put gloves on because that will happen and yet looks like I needed to change it already and as dust as that is draining I'm going to loosen up the filter as well try to use in that little claw that I bought but it's it's not small enough so guess I'm doing it by hand and see how all that oil would have got on the exhaust so it's good to put some newspaper in there okay and I'll be back after this is done draining okay so as though I was draining I noticed that this plastic thing that was in here came off and look at all the dirt I got off of it so I just used the toothbrush screwdriver to get it off because he was really on there is this barbecue grill cleaner that fell at home and it worked fine as way cleaner and the way this was in there was like this so this part that's loops like that goes on the top and I just came right out right out so it's real nice for that it's in those where the bolts go and it's in there and it's clean now so now that this is done draining I'm going to put the drain plug back in with the new gasket and the oil filter that I got came with a little film on top usually when I do that my car oils change I put a little bit of oil and I put it on top so that so it's easier to take off later but it looks like this one already came with grease on it so you don't have to do that put that on you don't want to use one of those like one of these things to sign this up just want to do it by hand you don't want to put it on there too tight then I'll shine this up in a minute and then since I have all this off I'm going to grease my chain as well this is the stuff I use and you want to do this like every three or five hundred miles so I just added a two and a half quarts of jam all ooh yummy Luba 10:40 make sure I want to make sure you have a funnel so you don't get it everywhere put the dipstick back in and put the cap back on up before I do that clean it up there's a little bit of oil in there I'm going to put it back on then I'm going to start the bike and run so the oil the oil goes in the filter and then I'm going to check the level you should buy the book it should take two and three quarters of this stuff so I'll start it now just run it for like 30 seconds or something ok so I love the change I put out two quarts and three quarters and it's full now so now we're going to put everything back in again be careful this spacers this one just fell out put those back in with that in there and just the same way you took it off back in that hole put this in here put this drain hoses back in put the cap back on and after I'm done with this and I ferrite tighten this up I'm going to go to the other side and do the radiator the coolant flush and then put this shifter back in there too okay so now I'm on the bit on the right side when I take this side off the bottom frame the meet and then to get to the radiator cap looks like I got to take this top part off first of all so do that should be pretty much the same as the other side so looks like there we go there should be a little plastic thing right there one of those that he push in and I should just come right out Oh see it there's another one in here and should be should be it for this knit friend took off the bottom one now there's one in the front the one that hooks up in the middle already took off from the other side just one down here and let's see what else up it looks like there's a one of these plastic things on the inside so that one's going to be harder to get to looks like that one is that instead of a push in you're gonna need a Phillips screw head and she be easier to do it from this side okay so I just got that one off it's right below the radiator and like you can see it's a Phillips screw head and it looks like there's at least one more I just 101 more of this plastic push it pushing things there's two up here guess I just took those two off from the top and on this side just take off your turn signal and you can take this now it looks like just need to get this one off this one i pierce a lot bigger than the others just one over here from here say what else and there's one in here there's one more down here so I just figured it out so after I took this tool off up here this thing just pops out its little hook so take that off and then now that this is being held by these cables that just you pull on this thing up just comes off it's kind of a little thing comes in and out there self-release right there so now you can see everything you're ready enter your reservoir and as you can see there's nothing in mine okay so now that we got the furnace off I'm going to do the coolant I'm going to take the cap off first take this off the problem and throw it up later and we're going to go down here then this is the one you want to take off for the coolant you're going to need a 8 millimeter I just loosen that a little bit it's already draining okay there goes time I let that drain so it's done and after that I'm going to take this clamp off and see if there's anything left in there okay so I just put the plug back in I decided not to take off this hose since I'm going to fill that up with distilled water anyways I should flush everything out I'm going to fill that up with this I'll let you know how much are used in a minute I'm going to run it close everything up run it then drain it back out then again I'm going to use this inch a nice it's supposed to make your engine run cooler all right okay so I just filled it up with distilled water it took about half a gallon to fill that up put the cap back on now I'm going to run the bike with that for a minute and I'm going to drain it back up and put the coolant back in so now that the drain plugs back in I'm going to fill it up with this engine ice stuff once the radiators full I will put the rest in the reservoir till they're full line okay okay so I just feel that the radiator it's all the way up and as you can see the reservoirs all the way to the full nine and a half a gallon of engine ice was plenty so now since the frames are off I went ahead and put the frame sliders on it's got a tighten this up and then we'll put the frames back on and if you have any questions just write on the comments below all right thanks you", "Y8T_Oas2vqc": "hello folks got some tips and pointers today I'm doing a clutch on a r1 got 2006 r1 here customer comes in complaining of the clutch sticking a little bit when you put in the gear a high release and also slipping when going down the road and hit the power band which is pretty obvious but sometimes these clutches will overheat and they'll stick a little bit and this is got about 7700 miles on it and it is detrimental to put this clutch in the proper way because there are two separate p2 two separate discs that go in first and last basically this last disc right here goes in at the very back of the basket here the back the back pressure plate basically and then the last one is the exact same size and as a regular discs but it looks a little bit different as far as the material goes and that goes on the front pressure plate of course if you put these all in the way they came out you should be good clutches that get burned up they tend to look like this see all the hearts the her the hot spots in it some of these discs were sticking on here because it got too hot someone who's either doing burnouts or feathering the clutch or just riding the heck out of it and you can see the little hot spots in there and that'll toast your clutch pretty easily now on these are 6 or these are ones if you don't put these in properly as far as the outer cover the clutch cover there's a gear right here with the with the clutch lever arm and the pin is got the gear also so you got to put it in the right way or you will have the proper clutch adjustment with proper proper clutch working there and right here you see this little arrow right here there's a cover that goes up that goes over this basically when you take this thing off the arm moves out a little bit and you gotta lighten this up with a little not there's a little little dot right there you can line that you can line it up perfectly right there you'll have good operation the cable won't feel loose you might have to a little bit of adjustments but you shouldn't have to adjust anything and doing these are these are our ones aren't too bad but like I said if you don't know what you're doing maybe ask for some help or maybe give me you know ask me some questions about how to do it Yamaha now makes a complete cut clutch kit it comes with the clutch cover gasket both the funny other clutch discs arm all the plates the steel plates and the springs and there's a little wire also there's a little wire that holds in the back the last plate and it looks like this right here this is your little wire and this thing you just use a little pair of maybe really skinny needle nose like this you get this wire and this goes around the like the clutch basket and it connects together and holds in the last plate it holds in the last steel plate in front of the last fish a piece of fishing material last disc so one hundred and ninety bucks I believe from the dealer no big deal I should go with the OEM stuff and took it out a test-drive earlier and it works great so make sure also that you Lube or soak the friction discs in oil before you install them I just dip them in oil I had I had a little a little lid right here I just dip them in oil got it all wet and put them right on there's no need to let these things soak overnight or anything just get them wet and let the material soak in the oil throw them on and fire up the bike wait about 10 to 15 minutes with it warmed up work the clutch in and out in and out like this for a little while and you should be good so any other questions please let me know thank you for watching", "gKrEiOQxuZY": "[Music] hello folks i hope you're all doing well uh in this video we're going to take a look at proud mary the crewn's clearwater revival song or uh the tina turner song it was written by john fogerty and uh it is a really fun one to play on the ukulele there's lots of stuff for us to explore so uh we'll start by checking out the chords uh and uh figuring out what the strumming pattern is and then we'll throw in some some different riffs and licks that you might be able to squeeze into the song so uh let's take a look at proud mary quick overview of all the chords that we're going to be looking at in this song uh we have our c chord a chord and g chord [Music] also got an f chord [Music] and we have a d chord it's going to be one of the most important ones that d we're going to be playing a lot of d and a b minor chord so lots of d lots of b minor um and uh those other chords the c a g and f are going to appear in the intro uh and it's a little chord progression that kind of breaks up the song a little bit very iconic if you know the song then you're going to recognize this part but before we get to that intro i just want to take a look at uh the main portion of the song so the d chord the a chord and the b minor chord we could remove the little intro bit and uh with just those three chords we can strum and sing um this this whole song we just won't uh have that little bit to play in between so that's where i want to start and then we'll add in the riff uh in the next section and we can put the whole piece together but like i said we're going to be spending a lot of time on this d chord so you're going to want to make sure that you found a comfortable way to play this d so uh there are a couple different ways that we can finger it um i uh in you probably notice me playing it like this uh in this particular play through i am using my tenor ukulele here uh and it is uh a longer neck and therefore my fret spaces are a bit bigger on this instrument than say on my soprano ukulele which is pretty small and it can be tough to squeeze all your fingers into this d chord here so especially when i'm playing it on a smaller instrument i might finger it like this for whatever reason it's just a little bit easier for me to squeeze my fingers in if i have my middle finger on the second fret of the g ring finger on the second fret of the e and my index finger is tucked in on the second fret of the c between the two of them um but find a position of this d chord that you're comfortable with and while you're at it because we spend so much time with this one chord in this song it can be nice to know a couple other ways to play the chord so for instance uh you might see me playing the d chord like this occasionally in this play through so i've got my pointer finger barred across all of my strings and then i'm adding my pinky finger on the fifth fret of the a string so all of my strings at the second fret barred with my pointer finger fifth fret of the a string with my pinky now i don't you don't want to actually put your fingers underneath the neck like this i'm just doing that so you can see my hands a little bit better your your hands are kind of want to be relaxed out like this but when i'm doing that you can't see what i'm doing so this is only for the video so this is another great version of d that we can use we could be playing this the entire time or we could just throw it in to change things up a little bit we've been playing this d a whole bunch and maybe we want a little bit of a different sound so i could jump over here there's another version of d that we could play [Music] and you'll see me use this version of d here i am barring all of my strings at the fifth fret with my index finger and then i'm adding in the sixth fret of the c string and the seventh fret of the g string um got my low g here so for you it might sound like this if you're playing with a re-entrance tuned ukulele but i've got my low g now this is another great one uh as we'll look at a little bit later on this uh particular voicing of d is going to allow us to play that little lick so if you want to learn how that goes uh wait till a little bit later in the video or uh hit one of the time stamps in the description below but before we get there let's uh hang out on a d that you're comfortable with or you're planning on using uh and uh and get a feel for what the strumming pattern is going to be so there is a document called proud mary riffs uh and on that document you are going to see how we play the intro how we play that little rolling on the river lick in a couple different places and we've also got the strumming pattern written out in tablature and standard notation so we've got uh four beats in each measure for this song and uh we're going to be playing this pattern here now in the notation i've got rests breaking up uh our down and up strums um but i find that it sounds really cool if we throw a chunk in there so try that out if that sounds cool to you uh i'm also playing with this little distortion pedal i got this many many years ago this little dan electro distortion pedal that has a speaker built into it so when i want to get a little a little grungy uh with my ukulele and i don't feel like carrying an entire amp around with me i can just carry this little uh battery-powered pedal with me with that little speaker built in uh it's just one setting it's on and off you're either distorted or you're you're not using the pedal uh but uh it's it's it's pretty fun and it sounds cool when i do that uh that little chunk [Music] effect but let's take a look at that strumming pattern so essentially what i'm doing is i'm going down up chunk up down up chunk up down up chunk up down up chunk up and that just keeps looping over and over and over again um let's see what it sounds like if i'm counting the beats so again four beats in each measure one and two and three and four and one and two and three and four and one and two and three and four and and then once again we're just going to keep playing that pattern over and over and over again uh now playing it slow is one thing but getting it up to speed it's gonna be another thing i should talk about this version of d that i'm playing too this version of d is kind of like my my my rock d when i just want when i'm like aiming at just playing like these two strings right here now inevitably i'm going to hit this e string as well but i'm kind of aiming for these two and i've got my pointer finger uh barred across the second fret but i'm relaxing my finger by the time it gets to the a string so i'm muting that a string and just playing the second frets of the g c and e string but i'm gonna play that uh strumming pattern a little bit um i'll i'll count us off and uh and we can practice playing that because again that's gonna be a bulk of this song just using that strumming pattern on a d chord so pick a d any d and let's try this one two and three and four and one and two and three and four and one and two three and four and one and two and three and four and one three and four so if you're going to be playing and singing along you'll want to spend enough time with that pattern to make sure it's it's a little syncopated right we're we're not playing all of our strums on the one two three four we've got some stuff happening in between those beats um so that can be a little bit tricky if you're not used to a pattern like that but practice it and uh and it'll start coming together so we've got our strumming pattern uh it's okay if when you're starting off putting the the words and the chords together uh it's okay if it's not uh if if you're not doing that strumming pattern right a lot of different strumming patterns are still going to work with this so uh don't be afraid to uh simplify things if you're working on it and you you you just want to play the song um that is totally fine um so especially when i'm kind of playing it slow and like walking through our rhythms i might just be strumming on each beat two three four i might just strum at the beginning of each measure playing whole notes one two three four one two three four so you might hear a variety of simplifications as i walk through these lyrics so don't be afraid to simplify okay i'm going to start off with that strumming pattern and then i'm going to start singing the verse the very first verse of the song one two three four here we go left a good job in the city working for the man every night and day and i never lost one minute of sleeping worrying about the way things might have been switched to a big wheel keep on turning be minor proud keep on burning we'll come back to this back today rolling rolling rolling on the river [Music] okay we're gonna do the same uh thing for the next verse and the third verse uh so uh that is that is essentially all you need to play the song you've got those three chords you got that strumming pattern uh and that is your structure let's pause for a moment to take a look at that b minor though so b minor is a bar chord uh here uh i am barring all of my strings at the second fret and then i'm adding in my ring finger on the fourth fret of the g string so again if you're playing on a re-entry tuning if you've got the high g yours should sound something like this however mine sounds like this both of them are right both of them are great uh they're both going to fit just fine into the song if these bar chords are new to you you're going to want to spend a little bit of time uh practicing and building up some strength uh in your in your fingers you're going to want to make sure that your thumb placement is good uh thumb kind of centered on the the middle of the back of the uh of the neck i don't want my thumb shooting out like that that's going to make it uh it's going to make it a little painful for me to hold that cord for a long period of time so i want to make sure that my my thumb is is bracing and supporting my other fingers um and i'm gonna i might need a little bit of time to just develop the strength in squeezing that cord uh one great way to practice that is to get all of your fingers into position and just squeeze you don't even have to worry about strumming so you can just do this while you're while you're watching your favorite show just have the ukulele in your lap you're not even bothering any of your housemates you just uh sit there and just squeeze that cord and you're you're exercising the muscles uh in your in your fretting hand so i can get used to that chord and build up some strength now where these bar chords can be a little bit tricky uh there's another uh version of the b minor that we can uh play we can play a b minor seventh now a b minor seventh [Music] here uh is not the chord that's written in the song uh but it's still going to work just fine and it is a little bit easier to play um because i don't have to worry about stretching another finger uh over to my g string there right all i have to do is hold all of my strings with this one finger i can concentrate all of my energy over there i don't have to worry about oh is my finger going to stretch far enough once again if you're if you're new to these types of chords uh that can take a little bit of time so a great substitute if you're still learning how to get that b minor proper or if you haven't been able to get it in context just yet uh you can use this b minor seventh and just bar all of these strings right here so uh once again mine sounds like this but yours will probably sound like this [Music] sounds kind of familiar doesn't it all right so we have our our d chord a chord b minor chord we have our strumming pattern and our basic structure now that we've got all of these elements i'm going to play versus two and then i'm going to jump to verse three just so we can hear what all of that sounds like i'm gonna i'm gonna strum it uh with with the strumming pattern um for the most part i might you know veer off i might get spacey and play something a little bit differently but i'm going to focus on getting that strumming pattern in there so we can see what this all sounds like in context so i'm going to play that uh just the uh strumming pattern on a d chord a couple times before i start singing i'll do that to give myself a chance to to get into the song and especially if i'm in between verses it gives me a chance to breathe and and kind of figure out where i am so here we go one two three four here we go cleaned a lot of plates in memphis pumped a lot of paint down in new orleans but i never saw the good side of the city till i hitched a ride on a riverboat queen big wheels keep on turning proud mary keep on burning jumping to verse three now here we go if you come down to the river bet you're gonna find some people who live you don't have to worry cause you don't have no money people on the river are happy to give big wheels keep on turning proud mary keep on burning [Music] just repeat at the end rolling rolling [Music] all right so with just three chords we can play this song all right let's take a look at some of these fancy bits so we'll start off with the uh intro riff now the intro riff uh is uh should sound pretty familiar once again if you're if you know the song uh and the strumming pattern is going to be very similar to the strumming pattern that we're using throughout uh the rest of the song so we start off going back and forth between this c chord and this a chord one and two and three and four and one and two and three and four and down up rest up up down up down up up up down up one and two and three and four and so i was just repeating that that a little progression right there just so we can get the the feel for our our strum there so we uh in context we're going to play that uh that bit two times c to a is going to occur two times and then on the third time we go back to c but we're gonna change up a little bit here one and two and three and four and one and two and three four lots going on there right so i have one and rest and three and four and [Music] so that's c a g f find the right find the right notes [Music] okay so that's the third measure into this little intro bit uh we are going to be holding that f into the next measure uh for the for the one that first down um in the next measure you'll see uh in the standard notation you'll see ties those lines connecting the same notes and in the tablature below you will see the the numbers the fret numbers on the tab at the beginning of measure 4 there in parentheses that means we are just continuing to hold those notes from the previous measure so we're just going to continue letting that ring out and we're going to begin strumming again once we see those tabs that are not in parentheses so the f chord begins on the end of measure three so i'll play measure three just for context one and two and three and four and one and two and okay i'm gonna hit that f one more time three and and then we change to d four and and then we go into the song so i would highly recommend printing this page out so so if you're if if you just saw that and you're like okay i got it great great awesome good job you're doing well um if you're looking at that and saying wait what just happened um that is okay too uh in that case i definitely recommend printing out this page and making some marks about downstrokes and upstrokes any notes that might help you make sense of of how this goes uh one of the keys is going to be using your ear uh listen to the song whether it be me playing it here in this video or the credence clearwater revival version which is in the same key listening to that very closely and internalizing how that rhythm works being able to read music is going to help speed up this process of figuring out what the rhythm is supposed to be um but uh it's not essential there are plenty of fabulous musicians who don't know how to read music and we'll just listen to it over and over and over again internalize what that rhythm is supposed to sound and feel like and uh and are able to play it so whatever is going to work best for you uh i will i will try to do a little bit of both of those things here so i'm going to play through the entire uh intro riff uh when i get to the end of it i'm gonna pause for a second and then do it again uh and i'll count us in both times so here we go starting on c one two three four and [Music] okay do it again one two three four [Music] and then that rolls right into our strumming pattern hanging on that d chord [Music] now while we're playing little riffs and licks uh we have to take a look at that little guitar lick that happens after we sing rolling on the river um now uh on the ukulele uh the way that i'm uh playing it uh if i'm playing my lead ukulele i'm gonna do this pattern right here okay might have seemed like a lot all altogether first there [Music] now in my play through i'm not playing that within my solo arrangement but if i was uh jamming along with other people maybe other people are are holding down the chord changes i might be uh just throwing in some little licks like this throughout the song uh it can be a really fun way to play especially if maybe you're you're not so much a singer and you just like to jam along well maybe some of these little melody licks can be really uh fun to throw in the mix so there are three shapes uh that i'm using for for this little pattern uh it is all taking place on the a string and the c string so for this little uh passage right here i don't have to worry about the g and e strings at all the first shape of three in this little passage here is the ninth fret of the c string and a string and i'm using my middle finger on the c ring finger on the a the second shape is just going to be the same strings same fingers on the seventh fret so seventh fret of the a seventh fret of the c and finally the last one is going to be fifth fret of the a sixth fret of the c so that's our little oddball right there [Music] so nine and nine seven and seven [Music] five and six okay so the first thing that you're going to want to do is just make sure that you can move around between those three positions right there because when we're playing this little lick in time it's gonna move pretty quickly uh now uh when i play this song i can start this riff uh just on the uh ninth fret of my strings but i like the sound of sliding into the ninth fret from the seventh fret now that's kind of a technique all all of its own that can take a long time uh to really get down so if you're not ready for that don't worry about it um i just like the sound of it i think it's pretty cool let me get the beard out of there [Music] i'll start it off there [Music] now i'm playing the exact same rhythm as i would sing rolling on the river [Music] right so i'm going nine nine seven five seven five rolling rolling rolling on the river rolling rolling rolling on the river [Music] that can be really cool uh the way you'll see me play that riff uh in the play through is i am using this version this barred version of my d chord and i'm using my pinky finger to stretch up to the ninth fret of the a and then i'm going to squeeze it into the seventh fret of the a i'll release it for the fifth fret of the a whoops hopefully hit the right note when i put my pinky back down on the seventh fret and then release here so it's hard to see because these fingers are playing the chord and covering up uh visibility to that a string but here's what it sounds like all together [Music] all right now so you can see behind the uh the fingers just pretend that my hand is barring all of that oops oh because i wasn't using my other fingers i wanted to go and you know play it with different fingers but i don't have that luxury because they're all occupied on that chord so i'm just moving my pinky around [Music] nine nine seven five seven five like that now if you're uh not feeling like jumping all the way up there uh for whatever reason uh we can play those same notes down here um well they're gonna be an octave lower right so um those three notes are going to be second fret of the e string open e string and second fret of the c string and i can play that same little melodic pattern now i'm two two open two of the c open e second of the c okay and uh maybe if you're playing your chords down here it's a little bit easier to throw that into the mix you don't want well you you could but you know it's going to be tougher to jump way up here and be accurate and then jump back down here if this is where you're playing the chords so uh uh you you know uh use your judgment about where you want to play what um but as you can see there are a lot of different options and there are a lot more licks that get thrown in if you listen to the credence version of this song there are all sorts of little guitar noodles and and things going on that we could replicate with the ukulele another element that i didn't include uh in in this little arrangement here is the solo so um the structure of the song if we're putting all of these pieces together we have our intro that part and then we go into verse one big wheels keep on turning proud murray keep on burning rolling rolling on the river and then we go into the second verse clean a lot of plays we go through all that and after that second rolling rolling rolling on the river and then we go back to the uh intro riff again this guy now in our version here we just moved from that intro riff uh back to uh verse three we just jump ahead to verse three uh in the uh credence version of the song um in between that uh we just play the verse chords and there's a guitar solo that happens over there just the same chords in the same pattern that you would play uh the uh a regular verse so playing that d for for a long time and then switching to the a and the b minor and going to the rolling on the river part uh so there would be a guitar solo over those chords and then it would go to that last verse um that is not included here because i have a feeling that a lot of us right now at least are going to be playing this song uh by ourselves but as uh it becomes easier and easier to play with others um if you have somebody or if you or somebody uh who likes to shred a little bit and rip some solos on your ukulele you could throw in that section right there in between the intro riff and the third verse so if you wanted to see what something like that would look like on the ukulele uh email me at tinyvillagemusic gmail.com i would love an excuse to uh tab out the uh the solo the guitar solo in this song for the ukulele so uh if that would be of interest to you let me know but for now let's see what the whole thing sounds and feels like all together uh play along with me however uh you are comfortable doing so uh and you can always come back to this video when you've learned a new technique or maybe learned a new section and you can strum right along one two three

"18Bnih3mksE": "if you just take the ram air front here and it's literally just that right here and there's one that goes in right here use a little screwdriver like so pop it out and you just take stuff off I mean it's kind of self-explanatory you see it and you're like oh okay the bolt goes into it it has like this copper piece on it just want to make sure that's okay this is still alright so I'll use it again it's not only good for a few times then once you got it inside off let it run so it's about 170 or so and then just fill it up with yeah now just take off the brake reservoir and then oh I think I didn't need like it eight millimeter you know now that it's clean I'm just going to put more distilled water into it", "i3_rZgJ62EE": "howdy I'm Lauren I'm one half of the group Angeles County and today I'm going to be showing you a rhythmic strumming pattern off of our song off of our new song goes like this all right so that's the tune and let's tell there's a lot going on in that riff so let's break it down all right so this is a riff that's a 16 count pattern and there's several different right-hand elements and even some left hand elements all mixed into that pattern so I'll just kind of go through the different elements that are in there in terms of right hand technique so one of the most basic techniques is just a Down stroke I'll use either my first two or my first three fingers better than just using your index finger you get a little more power out of it hitting all the strings going from the wrist sometimes when I do that I will hammer on with my left hand that's the first technique second technique is another type of down stroke but this time just using my thumb on the two or three bass strings it's kind of a softer quieter attack and I'll often follow that up with an upstroke using my index finger on the high strings just kind of just hitting the one top one or two or three strings I'll usually alternate between those another element I'll use is a Chuck lots of videos in YouTube explaining how to do a a Chuck and the last element is kind of a fan strum or a flamenco strum again lots of videos in YouTube explaining how to do a fan strum and then in the left hand kind of the two techniques I use is hammer ons and also left hand mute so choking off the sound by kind of releasing the pressure on the left hand but not taking the fingers off the strings entirely so I'll often use that when I do an upstroke with my index finger choke off the sound with a left hand alright so let's go through that whole pattern so sped up it sounds like but if I slow it down you can hear all 16 beats in that pattern [Music] and the way to practice this is to kind of break it down into different little bites so for starters I'm just going to hold a closed position a minor chord in my left hand so that's 4 4 3 2 and I'm using a bar but you don't have to use a bar this works just as well and then the first bite-sized chunk is just the first four beats of this pattern it sounds like so I'll beat one I'm hitting down all four strings with my two or three fingers on my right hand and then b2 I'm hammering on with my left hand on the two bass strings beat 3 I'm doing a Down stroke with my thumb again on just the bass strings and then beat 4 I'm doing an upstroke with my index finger on the high strings [Music] all right once practice that beat 5 then is a Chuck and then beat 6 and 7 is is an upstroke and then a downstroke with the thumb and then another upstroke again with the index finger again when I do the upstroke I'm using my left hand to mute the strings so instead of playing I'm letting it ring and that gives it a much more percussive sound [Music] alright and so the rest of the pattern is really just using alternating those down starts with the thumb and the lip strokes with that index finger up down down [Music] so you just got to basically slow it down and practice that and then the last thing I don't do it every time but when I kind of get to the end of a phrase and I'm ready to shift to a different chord is when I'll throw in one of this fan strums so so for that I do a Down stroke with two or three fingers and then another chakra so you can also hear I'm throwing in a lot of ghost notes where I'm again use them using my left your left hand to kind of mute the strings a little bit I'm still doing the pattern and I'm kind of alternating the up strokes and the down strokes and some chucks up down up [Music] all right so that's the basic rhythmic pattern next video we'll talk about the chords to grapevine because there's some pretty instructive things about minor mode harmony in this song all right thanks for watching see you next time", "YCejJNGl8tA": "welcome back today i am going to show you how i infuse my oils with natural herbs for my products come see [Music] sterile and clean is the way to be so i ordered these dried flowers from amazon they came six in the pack they smell so good so we have here not in any order lavender lemon forget me not rose jasmine cream chris santiams mums i know i messed that all up um so yeah those are the dried flowers there and and some dried calendula petals that i will add with my roses so we're going to start by measuring the coconut oil which is one of the carrier oils that i'm going to use i need to melt this down first so i'm going to measure out i believe 100 grams here i am not going by any specific recipe or formula i should say i am just eyeballing it but i am keeping track of my measurements because this is my first time infusing these herbs so yeah we in this thing together [Music] [Music] now i am measuring the grapeseed oil this is the second carrier oil that i am infusing again i'm not using any specific formula this is measuring 150 grams as i do plan to use more of this than the coconut oil in this specific product that i am making [Music] sterile and clean is the way to be so now i'm going to cut and measure my wax paper i'm using the wax paper to prevent the top and any moisture that may come in during the four to six weeks that i am infusing the oils just as protection for my oils so you want to make sure that they are just fitting just right to screw on the top so now i'm measuring out each flower at five grams i didn't use the whole bag just wanted to um use a little bit for now i am going to infuse rose i am going to infuse um with chrysanthemums i am going to infuse with lavender and i am going to infuse with jasmine i'm also going to add some chem candeluna petals to the rose jar because i want to infuse oil with a combination of those because again i know what i'm going to use this oil for and what products so yeah i'm like getting excited so now that my coconut oil is melted i'm going to go ahead and take it out of that hot pot so that it can start cooling down i don't want to burn my or my herbs um i'm gonna basically blend the coconut oil and grapeseed oil together because i just want to have all of those ingredients already blended as i know the amounts that i've used so i'll know how to transfer that into my base product that i plan to use these infused oils with to enhance that product i'm like getting so excited as i talk about it so yeah um we're gonna get that blended and then we are going to measure out how much to put in each container for infusing you want to make sure that the herbs are drenched in the oil that helps with making sure that no more no mold sets up um and you know just a smooth clean process throughout get your herbs at the end of the long four to six weeks i have patience so um for this kind of stuff so [Music] so as i previously mentioned i want my oils to be at room temperature so while we wait for the oils to cool down i am going to show you how i make my labels for these cute glasses so that i can tell them apart i don't know how they may change in color or aesthetics over four to six weeks so i want to make sure that everything is dry so that they can just stick on easily [Music] so my patience ended and 81 degrees became room temperature for me so i decided to put in about 70 grams oil in each container to start off with just so i would not run out of oil and i actually end up having to go back and add about 16 ounces more oil um but not to each one i broke that down so um yeah i ended up having to add more oil just again so that i can have more oil infused for later on when i plan to use it in my products so yeah i was just adding the amounts to the labels so that i can be aware of that a lot can happen in four to six weeks and i do plan to put these away and just kind of forget about them until it is time for me to use them [Music] so now we're just going to seal it up really tight with the wax paper that i had cut out to make sure that they store properly again i did reopen them and added more grape seed oil which i will insert a photo so that you can see how it should be drenched for sure but i added extra because i do plan to use this oil in my base products [Music] so here are the beauties and i just cannot wait to see how they come out in four to six weeks that is i marked my calendar i believe to be april the 25th i think it's what i put on my calendar so that seems like a long time away but yeah i love how they turned out [Music] and i will definitely be updating you guys on the finished product please like share and subscribe comment below let me know what you think about this video as i do plan to make more videos just bringing you into my space on how i create my whipped products so um yeah talk to you guys later bye you", "jZvudW59zoM": "hi everyone it is June can a welcome back to my channel yes today is week 1 from using the name oh I love my neem oil although I must say and be quite honest this is the first week that I have done it consistently for 3 days straight I haven't seen a huge difference only because it's it's only week 1 so I don't really see a difference in my hair but I am sticking to it I am doing the neem oil 3 times only one time do I use it overnight and the other two times I had it in a shower cap for about four hours and then washed it out so yeah I'm kind of I'm kind of loving it I do I've used this before my other youtube in my other hair growth challenge and my hair did grow back not grow back all the way but it did grow back significantly and so many of you have told me how much you love me moil and don't forget please do not use this if you're pregnant because this is not gonna pregnancy that's a potent this is so I really stressed that you research neem oil before you use it and also do a skin patch test on your forearm to make sure that you're not allergic to it because it is that potent I just said that right it is that potent so there are a lot of things you can research about this I'm honestly thinking about doing this for my face from what I hear neem oil is amazing especially if you have a lot of stuff going on with your face like I do it actually makes the pores a lot smaller it helps with blackheads it nourishes the skin etc etc so I think I'm going to do this but for now let's put some neem oil on because now it starts week number two I'm starting to actually like the smell you guys this is a little crazy because when I first started I was like how am I gonna do this it does it smells like rancid peanuts but now I actually like it so don't forget to use a towel I actually like this shirt and I don't want it to get most oil stains so I am putting a towel around my neck I actually love Indian products because I just I just feel that the people from all over the world they know a lot more than we do here in the United States seriously because I feel like we use more chemicals and and meanwhile people like in India and Africa they use things from plants like this neem oil at the home mean tree is good for you they use the leaves they use the bark they use everything of the neem tree I'm going to take a little bit now I'm gonna I don't have my applicator with me I'm gonna put a little bit in the cap I don't want to put my fingers on this directly because I don't want to get any oils or anything that I have even from my nails inside that bottle and contaminate the neem oil so I will be doing it from the cap and then I will wash the cap out later okay so you really don't need a lot for this rub get it nice and warm say on your fingertips and just rub baby's rub massage it don't be afraid massage yes yes I was gonna put the castor oil on my on the the remaining of my hair but I'm not doing that today they put a little bit more haha rub rub rub rub a dub-dub the smell is not that bad you guys make sure you get all over this feels good too I usually have to UM shampoo and condition my hair twice to really get the oil out so make sure you get a shampoo and conditioner that is like organic or something something really good try not to use the store brand with all the chemicals in it because it kind of like defeats the purpose of trying to get rid of all the the fungus the bacteria on your scalp so I usually go with doctor organic shampoo and conditioner it's amazing and I'll have the links down below you guys know if you guys watch my videos you know that that's what I use massage it good I'm gonna do some more and I'll be back okay so now at this time I usually put my hair up in a shower cap but it's an anthem so I'm not gonna go there right now so yes this is week one you're not gonna find results like oh my gosh I use it three times and my hair is growing like sprouts you're not going to unless you do and you're like one of those lucky ones but I promise you if you use a hair unless they promise I'll get in trouble but majority of people who use neem oil get really good results will you get all your hair back you may I never get all my hair back but I do end up getting my hair back thicker and that's okay with me as long as I you know as long as I see improvement then I'm gonna stick to it so I'm excited so again I'm gonna do this three times a week one time doing it overnight make sure you have a really really good shower cap and the other two T's just to for a couple of hours be mindful of how like you sit on your couch make sure you you know if you don't lay down on your couch you don't want to soil anything so investing getting a very good shower half that won't see through and yeah I'm excited so let me know if you guys are trying this neem oil or if you're trying something else what's working for you I want to know my viewers want to know and I love you guys so much and I'll see you back for week two bye", "I9MXDDCYJXI": "guys are so the are ones back in the garage and today I'm going to try and do is change my clutch clutch arm or clutch rod seal it's leaking a bit of oil it's been leaking it's been trickling for a while and I've just saved this job until until I do a change my oil as well so what I've done is I've drained out the oil there and the leak I want to try to show you right there is the clutch rod clutch cable and as you can see all around is oil residue it's been trickling for a while it's been bothering me so hopefully today I'm going to change it and what I show you the actual leak itself don't know if you can make that out will try get you focused so yeah basically around there that's the seal so I'm going to try to change that is the new part coming along it's a tight little sill so I'm going to try to change that today what guys so the first thing I do is loosen off the clutch cable so you could have to loosen these are twelve twelve little bolts off if these aren't really tight you might have to loosen off at the handlebar end as well once you loosen that be off just drop it down the bottom and this should come completely loose you've got a little metal tab there that's holding the clutch cable in just pry that open and that should release your clutch cable there all right so now what we want to do is remove all of the Allen bolts all the way around the cover so we're going to go ahead and do that now you once you've removed all the bolts around all the way around now you want to carefully take the cover off be careful you don't kind of tear the gasket that's in there as you can see the gasket that's around there don't know I've got another gasket there so most likely I'm going to replace this gasket anyway so but you've got this off guys and all you want to do is to remove the shaft you've got this this clip at the top of the Milic see what you want to just use two flathead screwdrivers and just to pop this down and then you should be able to remove the washer and pull out the shaft and then got another washer keep those safe and then you should be able to move the shaft all right so the easiest way to remove this seal is use a bearing puller get the right size and get it right into the tip and start tightening it and stop tightening it you want to tie it just on the seal and not be bearing that's inside get get it nice and snug and then should be able to just wiggle it off that's all you will do is inspect the inside of the housings of the seal make sure it's not scratches or cracks or anything which could cause more leaks in the future we'll give this a good clean game nice clean rag just give it a good clean inside so there's no dirt or grit inside there before we replace the zoo before we place the new seal in there and then no guys so get your new seal and make sure it's clean and it does not have even a tiny little speck of dust or grit on it give it a nice little clean make sure you even clean your own fingers while you're doing this now we're going to prepare to install this seal back into the housing and before I do that what I'm gonna do you just use a little girl for you this is just normal engine oil that's for this bike I'm just going to lube the outside ring of it go all the way around just so that the install is easy and seal doesn't curl up while I'm trying to install it so all gonna do get the highs in and just try it widget in as much as you can by hand you want to make sure it doesn't go in bent try to make it go in as straight as possible it can once you've got a little bit of it in what we're going to do is get a sucker which is the right size for this on this occasions my teen milk seems to be okay sighs and you just want to lightly very lightly just tap this in make sure you've got it lined up nicely with the silk try to make sure that it all goes in equally order all the way around the ring guys so once you've tapped in your new silk make sure you use the right size socket and take it easy nice and easy light taps until you've got the seal right in there all the way around is equal and it's flush and then we can begin the reinstall we want to do is just go around the edges of the contact points and just give it a good clean where the new gasket is going to sit give you a nice good clean order around on both surfaces before we put the new gasket on so go ahead and get your new gasket and nice and gently put into place once you've obviously cleaned both the surfaces to the best of your ability and make sure there's no no debris no dirt that you wouldn't want to mix with your engine oil in there guys so get your shaft before replacing it and make sure you give it a good clean make sure there's no sharp especially around where the seal sits give that a good clean and make sure there's nothing sharp or you know something that can cause another leak again go ahead and do that once you've got the shaft nice and clean you will nice and carefully reinsert it into the housing and just pop that through and now go ahead and replace praise the washout at the top and just push your retaining clip back into place you should be just able to just push it in or just use something just push it back into place okay so once you've popped the retaining clip back in this is the bit where usually everybody struggles so what you want to do is now the replacement so what you've got here is this little bit sticking out with the teeth and you want that to go in here to join those teeth so we're going to do is a place just try to line up because this is tilting down a bit look up here so what you'll do is lined up with this sort of the teeth by each other this can be a bit tricky guys so it's going to take a couple of attempts unless your first time lucky look and feel when it's kind of falling into place and if it hasn't you might have to get it back out and have a look line this up a bit and then keep going I'll obviously you're working blind here so I'm just gonna have to judge it it's going to take some time I'll come from slightly underneath up and once you in you should feel once it's bitten just push this bottom bit in and you'll see it's kind of goes into place or vice so they saw just need small small adjustments every time you attempt it and then you finally get the dot lined up with the arrow and then just secure two bolts on and then what I'm going to do is just go around just secure the rest of the bolts on I'm not going to tighten them yet and then what we're going to do is talk them down properly on guys so I've just done hand time and these are boats although around is the secure in place because I don't want to go through this again and what I'm going to do now is just clean up all the oil I was leaking from there so obviously if it does start leaking again we'll know what's going on and I'm going to talk this down to the correct talk in a little while but for now I'm just going to go and give this a good clean get all the old oil residue off of there so we know if we've got a new leak or if we've solved our problem these are all ten you and me as each from the research that I've done and I've set my torque wrench for 10-year meters so I'm going to go ahead and to start talking these down what I'm going to do is go in a crisscross pan so if I start here next one I'll do is there then probably there and there and just basic crisscross all the way around and I'm going to go ahead and do that now Oh so I've talked now I'm going to start reattaching the cables Oh God so what you want to make sure is the arrow and the dot are aligned whilst this piece here is fully all the way as far as it will go you shouldn't be able to engage your clutch with just your finger so needs to be all the way in as far as it will go and that's when the arrow the door should be aligned then go ahead and attach a clutch cable and tie it up your bolts as it was before and go ahead and adjust the handlebar end as well to your preference get the right free play and should spring right back like that they have it good and top up your oil as it was before and what I'm going to be using awfully this time is this magnetic bolt so was it pick up any metal debris that might be floating around in your tank I'm going to give that a go see how it goes so yeah that's it guys hope this helped to let me know and peace", "mFzCd0ATUr8": "mm for r1 and I didn't know this when I bought it but they are known for running hot as hell so I fix the problem everybody's like Oh expansion tank and all this okay the fan doesn't come on until 2:17 I believe okay by that time that thing is climbing higher okay and it's in it and it runs up to 237 I've seen this thing at 237 and 241 that's really close to being damaging okay so there's two fans one on each side here's the plug for one right here let's say here's a plug okay I've already covered it up so I should have done this earlier but I just wanted to say I fixed the problem because now it can't get to 237 if the fans come on earlier so let's get to the other side okay this is the this is the ignition wire right here there's two hours for the key I just cut a little slice in it put a jumper wire a jumper wire runs to the fan it's that simple six inches of wire right here about two feet of wire for the other fan now it'll neck it'll never get hot you can turn the key on and to cool the bike down but it'll never reach 218 or 230 because the fans will be on cooling the bike so I don't know why people haven't done this already I mean everybody keeps trying to find answers and there is no answer it just runs hot as Hale I don't know why so I'll keep you updated to see how it goes along but I would suggest just run a jumper it's just that simple it's just a jump wire it's running it that you pull it to a red light and the fans are already on it's already blowing cool air over the bike so it's it's got to keep it cooler and and I'm assuming that it will never see 2:30 again because that scares the out of me my GSXR has never ever seen 2:30 not ever ever ever ever this thing is like 2:30 every single day so alright stay tuned", "M_Gt8wdbvaA": "[Music] hey what's everybody Tyler from symptoms again with another lesson with my father and my mother and we're gonna try to squeeze this one in before we're taking over all right today we're gonna learn your first two chords we're gonna is the okay so we're gonna take our middle finger [Music] and we're gonna count or do that four times three good so now this is why these are the best to course learn F chord is our second chord because we're gonna keep this finger down we're gonna take our pointer finger place it on the first fret or Easter you gotta go down one there you go right now I'm singing this one here on the first fret so now we have so here's the deal we've learned our a minor we've learned our F and we've avoided the dustbowl a Hagar like Jimmy Fallon in a car and we're like Jimmy Fallon in a car or James Corden thank you mom thank you because carpool karaoke is not a Jimmy Fallon thing day so we're gonna do now we're gonna use this finger to strum and we're gonna use the first two chords you've learned we're gonna do down just down four times in each chord what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna count them and I'm gonna say one two three four change two three two three or good dad you planning a little bit you're planning a No so this is there's a common misconception that happens this is your F chord and this is your a chord mom's playing an F chord she's doing good and that's doing good but he's not doing great he's got to get that finger down one string all right here no the other one uh-huh uh-huh that's your F chord and this is Michael and this is your a minor yes okay okay so we start over from the a minor one two three four [Music] okay now we have one other little mistake and this is my fault on a communication dad's playing F mom playing a minor now if you're a beginner watching this if you're beginner watching that mate that makes an F major seven but we're not trying to go for that so what we're gonna do is we're starting the a minor okay and I'll count one two three four and then we'll do a minor okay one two three four a minor two three four Gordon [Music] and so at the end of the day if you can do that I'm gonna put a link below to the song dreams by Fleetwood Mac and if you can do those two chords you could already have your first song so to this point you should be able to tune your ukulele which my two students can check you should be play a minor let me hear it a minor in an F chord F chord all right and which finger do we strum with rock and roll all right so next time we're gonna add two more chords we're gonna talk about something called a strum pattern so you can see in just two lessons we're already rocking and rolling wait till we get to three four and five all right okay everybody 10 thumbs procom thank you so much for learning keep on learning with us other goodies at patreon bond our ukuleles if you want to get started and until next time keep rolling life is good love peace and chicken grease take care yourselves", "vTtGafwdN6I": "you hey everybody one guy two wheels here I've been getting more and more emails from people requesting videos so I guess I'll start making more videos of the projects that I have going on and right now this is a project I'm working on you can't really tell what it is right now but it is a 2001 I Yamaha YZF 600 R that's also known as the Thundercat this one is my mom's bike that she just picked up and what I've done to it so far is we had the the fork seals fixed because one was leaking I took it all apart checked out the engine cleaned everything up it's got a r6 tail on it I don't know if you can see but the way the guy that had this before did it he had to take out the radiator overflow reservoir and all I did was cap off the hose and that was leaking so we got a radiator wet reservoir but with the way this tail is there's no room inside the tail for the reservoir anymore so I had to figure out a way to get it in here and that's where I put it and seems to work well I don't know what exhaust it's got on it because it's grinded off they painted the frame white and when I did that they covered up the VIN number and whatnot so I had to fix all that and anyways what I'm going to be doing on this bike today is we're just going to do oil change on it and probably get the brakes done today too we got some new brake pads for it and so we'll do that we got some brand new tires on or two so I would dive on into this get this oil change going all right right here is where you put oil in obviously down here is where you're going to check your oil level there's a little bark on there and you got to be line between the lines if you can see right there where my fingers that is the oil filter and right about in the middle of the oil pan here on the other side of the bike is the drain plug and so we'll start off with the draining out the existing oil all right we're on the left side of the bike now and this bolt right here is your oil drain bolt here I got oil pan here to catch it and one thing I did in video is pull your oil filler cap off first alright so let's get started and that was a 17 millimeter socket that you used on there all right so now we'll go ahead and take the oil filter off it's right over here towards the front of the bike see if I can get you a good shot here right there I don't know if you can see how it's gonna work Oh your projects gonna have to trust me that's there so go ahead and pull that off if I can yeah it's on there pretty tight here comes a little bit more oil coming out of there I have to clean the oil off the headers when we're done otherwise that is gonna smoke it up we start it up we'll let that drain and then we'll put the new oil filter on and and start filling it up this is what we're going to be putting in here we got a some mobile 1:10 w4t oil we got a can in oil filter part number is KN 303 this one has the wrench off top so you can just use a wrench or a socket to put it on and that's it looks like the almost done draining over there now we'll get to putting this on all right it's all done leaking so we can put the new oil filter on with any oil filter you want to get some oil on that rubber o-ring there before you put it on but with this K&N filter it already comes pre oiled I had to pull a little plastic seal off of it but it's already pretty oiled so we can go ahead and and put it right on since it's got the wrench on top we can use a ranch or in my case when I use a socket here and you don't want to over tighten it you just want to Snug it up I should do it right there now we'll put the drain plug in and then we can start filling her up with some nice mobile one oil and again this drain plug is a 17 millimeter socket or a wrench whenever you choose to use I prefer sockets difficult to do one-handed that's on there now we start filling it up alright so now we're going to go ahead and start filling her up I'm not sure how many quarts this one takes doesn't say anywhere I hear because the guy removed all the labels off of it but I went ahead and I got four quarts here now that's what they the guy had a cycle gear said to get so I'm going to just start filling it up and I'm going to watch our level gauge right here and make sure we don't overfill it and here we go making a mess maybe I should have grabbed my phone there's one down I think for the sake of the length of this video I'm going to cut it right here and then we'll come back after a couple quarts I wanted to show you this real quick and this is where you're going to check it royal level kind of hard to see on here but there's a dot right there and another dot right there and you want your oil level to be right in the middle of those dots right there so when you stand your bike upright your oil level should be right in between those lines there all right well the guy at cycle GU is right took about three and three-quarter court soil as you can see we got our bottle mark here and our top mark here and just thread above the in between them so yeah good level oil now all we got to do now is go ahead and put the cap on here and oil change is done and that's how you do it you just did a oil change on your YZF 600 R or thundercat whatever you decide to call it and keep your running good I think I might go ahead and do the do the brakes to and put that on another video so how much is one guy two wheels and thank you for watching", "akI1UlHAlq0": "Hey ladies and gentlemen so I'm here in my garage and I had a fix for the Yamaha r1 it's been overheating for me I know it's a common issue so I wanted to just throw a video on YouTube because I didn't see one before and I think it can help anyway so it was a few things that simultaneously hit the fan for me figuratively and literally basically my cooling fans stopped working and actually I brought a flashlight here so I'm going to show so cooling fans you'll notice are right behind there's the actual fan and so it's behind all these wires all these wires have to tuck in and that's actually where the issue was so if I can kind of maneuver this this here that connector with the blue wire coming out of it that is actually power supply blue and black wire actually that's the power supply for the fan so that is coming directly from the battery and anyway as you can see I've taped this up so that was actually rubbing against the fan the fan power was killing itself and so that was one of the issues I didn't get grounded itself out so I fixed that anyway make sure that is one thing you definitely want to check aside from obviously like fuses so that's one thing you want to check make sure no wires or any kind of cable or whatever is going on in there is rubbing against this fan number two so that's kind of where it is anyway obviously that's for the fan is so basically that's what you want to keep it away from second thing I did is I replaced the relay there is the nice shiny new relay so I replaced that that was like 30 bucks I got it from two-wheel pros so good price there while I was at it I haven't ridden this bike in like a month so I just decided to take everything apart I redid the headlight connectors because they were aftermarket and there was and they were also soldered so I decided to make some kind of quick quicker really connections there so the relay needed to be done third thing you'll notice that wire coming out of there I did get a rig a fan switch so I'll show that really quick okay so here at the front of the bike so I rigged it so it's right in there and that's a really good switch actually it does have a little LED I didn't get that to work I was putting it right to the battery which was a shitty idea so you need to figure out how to tap into somewhere after the ignition but that said I finally took the actual positive terminal or the positive lead off there it's actually a three prong switch and I took the the supply off of there seems to work now so let's see so right now it's just kind of a conveniently located and it works like a champ okay and the last thing I'm doing and I haven't done it quite yet is the hose here which commonly breaks it's this guy with the kink in it and this thing I couldn't tell where was leaking so you'll notice there's you know dried coolant everywhere it's obviously been leaking at the bottom and so it looks good right like everything looks good look especially right here on that seam doesn't look bad like I was stumped as to where I was leaking coolant I thought it was the connections there and there so I tighten those down protip don't do that because you'll crack the hose not what happened but actually right there on that seam that white part that is actually where it broke so there's a very very small hole there that isn't going to leak until you actually turn on the bike and build up pressure in the system so I actually got the cuff this is an updated part so that right there pause the video or whatever get the updated part it's this new hose and it's better apparently so we're gonna put that in in just a moment and I'll be right back okay so finally picking this video up a few days later anyway finally finished with the hose it is in there is brand new very beautiful has not leaked yet so knock on wood with that as we can tell I put the bike back together for the most part here and the one thing I've been having issues with you'll notice speedy dry down there there's been a really slow leak which is behind behind this fairing here you can kind of see right there the little hose clamp anyway hasn't you know I didn't clamp it down very well maybe a little bit too tight yeah you can't over tighten it anyway there's been a slow leak but at this point that's okay I'm just gonna leave it as is but yeah finally back together finally got it back on the road and writing and now it's fall so yeah going to get as much time in as we can but anyway that was basically the fix and just wanted to give a quick update on that thanks for watching [Music]", "Nj93NabByp0": "hey guys welcome back to my channel if this is your first time welcome welcome welcome in today's video i'll be showing you how i make my neem oil using just coconut oil and neem powder so i'm going to be transferring both ingredients into the other bowl but before i do that let me share some of the benefits of using neem oil neem oil has amazing benefits like anti-inflammatory antifungal we all know that fungi blocks the hair follicles and can also create dandruff which can lead to dry scalp so neem oil or neem is actually a great remedy to cure dandruff and also for lice and eczema and neem oil is said to be very powerful herbs it also helps with sebum production and it also moisturizes the scalp neem treats scalp issues like psoriasis that can lead to permanent hair loss if left untreated so it also helps with baldness or hair loss let's say battling with hair loss neem is a very great remedy for that so that is all the for so that is the benefit of using me so now i've transferred both ingredients into the bowl and now time to mix both ingredients together while mixing bowl ingredient make sure it has a liquid or that's a liquid or watery okay liquid kind of paste make sure it's not a thick paste so if it's looking thick you might need to add a bit of more oil until you get that liquid paste to make sure it's not thick because what we need is just the oil we don't really need the oil we just need the oil to mix with the halves don't really need the thickness just the oil you can see how the paste is looking in its liquid form i'm using the double boiler method by getting a pot and filling it with water then i add the bowl with the mixture into the water and then i let it boil for 10 to 15 minutes me i don't exceed 10 minutes but you can let it boil up to 15 minutes not more than 50 minutes so you don't let all the nutrients leave now i have taken out the mixture from the bowl it's quite hot whoo i was filming dabuski so you let it sit for 30 minutes to an hour just let it cool down but i let my seat for 30 minutes and let it cool down so now i'm going to sieve out the oil into this cup yeah so now i'm applying my wig cap here's a new wake up always get new ones so yeah i'm going to apply now i'm going to transfer the mixture and pour the mixture into the cup you can already see the herbs are on that like you can see the herbs are under the cup so what we just need is the oil and not the herbs okay we need both here because the hubs are mixed with the oil but what we just really need is just the liquid the oil that is what we need from this mixture so now i'm going to grab that and i'm going to strain out the oil into the cup so make sure you get something maybe you can use um stockings too like a clean stockings even though you can use a wig cap again it really is anything um that would strain out the oil so now as you can see i'm straining out the oil from the from the wig cap into the cup now i'm going to transfer the oil into that butter so now i've transferred the oil into the botsu and now i'm going to show you guys how i apply the neem oil as a pre-poo on my hair so keep on watching so now i'm applying the neem oil overnight i'm about to go to bed and i decided to apply the oil before i go to bed so i'm going to be showing you guys how i do that my hair is already in sections and now i'm going to apply the oil so you can see my hair is overly dry that's when i usually do a pre-poo when my hair is extremely dry i don't always do a pre-poo only when it's needed so now my hair looks dead and it needs to be resurrected so now i'm going to be adding the oil to my hair and i'm going to be making sure i'm removing any form of shaded hairs on my hair and adding more oil to that section and i'm going to be finger detangling i had to separate it because my hair my back hair is really thick and i don't want i want the oil to be to go round like all over my head because now that oil is needed on my hair so now i'm going to be finger detangling um make sure you don't use a comb when doing this process when finger detangling doing your pre-poo so you can see i'm not using a comb but i'm just using my fingers to remove any form of knots on my hair so that's what i'm going to be doing so now i'm massaging the oil to my scalp and i'm finger detangling um my hair so that's what you need to do you don't need any form of um comb during this process all you just need to do is remove any form of knots at this process so now making sure the oil sinks in around that section of my hair and it's done so now i'm putting that section back in twists so that's to make sure it's secured as you can see the other side of my hair you can see the difference between that side and the other side so one thing i would like you to notice um to keep in mind is that when doing your pre-poo any form of shaded hair on your head take it out don't be scared don't feel oh and it's like i don't want to shed too much hair or yeah excessive shedding can be bad but i'm like i don't want to shed all the hairs i just want a little bit of shady hairs any form of shadows shaded hairs take it out from each section to finger detangle properly and take out the shaded hairs expected to be out of your hair the next day your detangling process is going to be stressful because all those hairs shed heads are meant to be shaded are going to come back are going to mix with the other hairs dynamically i'm going to form not serious knots on your head so and it's going to make your detangling process stressful so please please any form of shaded hairs take it out so now as you can see i'm working on that section and i'm just running my hands through it's making sure the oil sticks sinks in so i'm putting it into i'm sectioning that part into two and then i'm pulling it in i'm putting it in a twist so now i'm done with the back of my hair and i want to focus on the front is it just me but it's way easier to work on the front of your head and the back i don't know to me so now i'm applying the oil to the front of my hair and i'm massaging it also focusing on my ends make sure when you're applying this oil you focus on your ends and also your edges your scalp make sure you focus on them and then now i'm finger detangling that part of my hair very important you can see i'm using no comb guys just finger detangle your hair i'm not using any combo detangling brush this process is doing my wash day i'm going to do that but for now i'm not using any comb so that is what i'm doing for that section of my hair as you can see so now you can see i'm focusing on the ends like i said earlier you make sure the oil is at the ends especially you focus on ends and the edges you apply the oil you massage it to those parts and i'm going to be doing the same thing to the other section of my hair in front so now this is how my hair looks like after applying the oil and i'm going to get my processing cap and i'm going to apply it on my hair and then i'm going to get my scarf my silk scarf because i need it to be protected i don't want to wake up in the morning and then the processing cup is off my head i'm going to tie it around my head now i am ready to go to bed don't forget to like this video and subscribe to see more hair tutorials and diys on this channel bye and see you guys next time", "D4Imz3tEAfA": "hello YouTube we are out here with the Yamaha our 1000 to 2008 model and after changing the clutch plates inside the bike and putting the housing back on we found that there is a lot of slack right here in this actuator arm so I want to show you the simplest way to fix it there's two ways you can pull this keeper pin right here is that that c-clip you can pull that off and you can attempt to rotate that a few degrees this way but that'll put it kind of way over here and then you'll pull the slack back this way it's not a problem otherwise we're going to take all these bolts out right here I'm going to take these out because this is kind of like the most common mistake that everybody makes so give me a second I'm going to I'm going to back these bolts out okay I'm back so taking all the bolts loose from the housing and make sure y'all got this frame slider take this frame slider and shift it over because you need this to be free so again look if I pull this down and it's actually in position right here you got a lot of slack in the cable we don't want all that slack what we want is for this to be in a position when we pull it this way to where it it reaches the end right there right now we've got way too much slack so I pull on the clutch up top and all we get is nothing it's just like 1002 let's go and take this off I'm gonna take that off now let me show you the reason I loosen those bolts up is because this will expand outward as I start to turn this counterclockwise that whole housing comes off of there like that but I pulled it off so far what I want to do is all I hear this thing click one time for me sorry like that then and I put it back in place okay I've rotated this one click counterclockwise now when I pull it it's right there and you notice that this doesn't quite reach all the way over there that's because I need to put tension on it I'll turn it with a stand of locks like that and I need my other hand so we hold that yeah 1 6 2 n so using the channel locks or whatever tool you have set it and now it's set now if I go up to the top of the clutch okay okay so now that we've got it set and we go up to the top and we pull the clutch lever you'll feel it pulling still ok yeah so from up there I can also adjust down here all right I'll make some adjustments down here but anyways yeah let's how you make this adjustment if you finally have too much lock in there loosen all these bolts up and turn this guy counterclockwise one time till you hear a loud click click it's basically skipping one tooth inside so once you reset it that shaft goes in and this guy gets playback so that's that right there", "lQvEbKmcqV8": "I'm Brian van sportbiketrackgear.com and today we're gonna install the RNG racing engine over covers on our 2017 STG Yamaha r6 project bike ok the R and G over covers on the Yamaha r6 with a 3-piece kit we're covering the clutch cover the ignition cover and on the other side of the motorcycle this stator cover this is a four millimeter thick polypropylene / cover it's molded to slide over the OE cover you're going to remove a few of the OE bolts slide it over there spacers that go between the cover and the / cover and then you have fasteners that hold it in place okay this looks similar to the GP racing covers we've done installs on those before okay so it's a product that's a similar concept where it differs is this covers the entire cover on each one and it also has a replaceable puck in the center now realistically looking at this and having crashed a motorcycle a time or two myself would you be able to get away with just replacing that slider plug I mean that's really gonna depend upon the crash okay so if you get fortunate enough it's a tiny little crash or it doesn't make a lot of contact you'd be able to replace that and have it looking like new again when you install these there is a spacer that goes between the OE cover and the over cover so it's held out just a little bit from the actual original equipment cover ok let's talk now about the installation itself with the product and if you want to see it you can watch it it was really straightforward you're just pulling a couple of bolts out follow the instructions get the spacers in the right place use the right length bolts put the washers in the right places and I would say that they fit well what I did notice with these is compared to the other brands that I've installed the GB racing and then remember to like woodcraft has over covers vortex has over covers those are done in aluminum right not a composite or plastic but in aluminum so is very precise the fit of the GB racing that was pretty precise too I found this to be just a little bit less precise than those the pros are you know it covers the entire engine cover so there's some little trade-offs here but in the end I think the installation of this was a snap they fit well they look good you can see up here at the oil fill cap you know it's just the holes up just a little bit of skew and I did try to move that around a little bit is that a deal-breaker is they even a big deal no not really this full cover set is somewhere in the $30 less than GB racing for the same bike price range there's a little bit of a savings there so some pros some kinds overall I think it's a good product for sure let's go over the other side and take a look over here on the stator side you're removing a factory cover protector on the later gen are six s and then installing this it goes right over the top and you can kind of see here from the lip and that is literally covering the entire engine cover so a little different strategy out of the box with the RG stuff the quality was nice the insulation straightforward I think the price is fair if you want to see more details watch the second half of this video okay of course in order to install the RG over covers I got to remove the fairings again we're gonna show you some of it but not all of it the RG frame slider kit that we put on this is kind of interesting the way you removed the center cap I want to get in there the pic and depress that tank and it pops right out you don't want to stick a screwdriver in there in wedge and start tearing this all up you can see they have just kind of a small circular hole so a pic is gonna work the best they look great the last thing you want to do is destroy that by going all primitive Pete with the tools and I realize that is coming from the guy who does not go to work we're gonna show you some of this but not all of its stable fast-forward through some we did get a question today on one of the videos about how much we're changing the oil be impacted by having that orangey no-cut frame slider kit so we'll show you for sure the other side what it takes to remove the fairing there [Music] okay the RNG racing over covers it's a complete kit you got clutch Nishan and then we have stator we're to cover each one on their bolt over coverage we've got new hardware that's gonna replace the OE hardware and their design has spacers that will be fitted between the overcometh and the stock cover to maintain a gap like so okay this particular one for the clutch we have four spacers four fasteners all of equal length the only difference is there's always a three washers this fastener right up here and you hold the cover up to it you see what we're gonna be working on this one is not going to get a washer by design by removing this we need some axis here okay remove that retainer gonna pull that driven oil fill cap once again use the cover as a gauge what are we what are we pulling up okay make sure the engine is cold too don't do this when the motor is all hot kind of slip it over get a look at it we're going here we're going here make sure you save all your stock fasteners you never know when you may need these in the future [Music] our G does a nice job of the instructions got photos exploded views wax okay I'll get the cover back up here and we're gonna be down in this corner here and then one more right over here it looks like this cover set actually goes all the way back in terms of fitment all the way back to 2006 Yamaha is definitely the r6 been such a great bike even with the redesign and seventeen that did not need to be a ground-up redesign so there's a lot of items that are shared between the 2006 and the 2017 to 18 okay before we slide the cover in place I'm gonna get all of these spacers and serve it into the cover it does look like they're going to hold themselves in there but I'll say this that don't really engage super hard okay so you're gonna want to be careful sliding us into place I wanna try and distort it as little as possible so I'm not chasing these spacers all over the place give it a go like this if not I'll try and put something in there to help hold them in place if I need to but hopefully we don't have to do that the other covers that are more exposed that's really not going to be an issue with the clutch cover kind of tucks up inside the frame a little bit and you see that you can see that just started - I've got the bolt in place that's gonna help me hold it so you can see what I did there I kind of I noticed that one started to pop out so I slid the fastener in through that spacer just to help hold it in place while I was getting everything into position the cover is not in there all the way yet make sure you just get the fasteners kind of going before I go too much farther here just gonna get these started you want to make sure that he cover is engaged properly with that spacer number this upper hole there is no washer being used for the instructions okay just the spacer is there I've got all the fasteners started I'm just gonna kind of tap on this slightly and make sure we're engaging properly with all the spacers and before I tighten any one of the individual fasteners down all the way I'm just going to kind of run around I want to make sure it's nice and even before I put any final torque they do have torque specs included if you prefer to use a torque wrench you're getting pretty close to the point when you would reach for it and you can feel once all the fasteners have seated down and now I'll give them the final torque I'm going to run around these a couple times to make sure they're as even as possible oil fill cap reinstall that like so okay I've got the clutch cover protector on the mount for the coolant hose I've got that back in place now let's take a look and see which fasteners we need to remove here it's gonna be here here and here there is one longer fastener that's used on this cover and it's going to be in this location right here you can kind of see that in the OEM fastener as well that one is longer it's gonna be to allow for that bracket that they have for the clutch cable so really important you get that lined out to begin with okay since I have complete access here I'm going to install these one at a time okay when you go to slide the cover I'm sorry when you go to slide the spacer into the cover it doesn't really hold itself there which is a little bit challenging okay if you try to put it all on as a unit but the way this is all out in the open not really a big deal as you're able to touch each one of those without any trouble just need to make sure that you leave them loose enough so you can manipulate the cover and get behind it and this one here remember - we do have that retainer for the harness make sure that's in play you know actually when you're just starting to thread these down you're gonna feel that spacer kind of align itself there once again if you prefer to use a torque wrench now is the time you want to go ahead and grab that and put the final torque on these and now we have the ignition over cover installed right next to the clutch cover okay as we go ahead and get started on the stator side cover protector remember we install those orangey arrow style no cut sliders last week I've already gotten the comment on that video asking how is this going to affect removing the fairing so we're gonna be able to address that that's something that you're going to need to do right so this process right here this is the additional time that you would have to invest in fairing removal for that oil change if you want to pull it I do think you could probably loosen this all up down low and pull it out of the way to get the oil filter but you know some folks don't like to tug on it they actually want to pull it all apart so it's going to depend upon what you are most comfortable doing okay now I have the right size tool we're good to go so this is the additional time that you're going to have invested right here because you will need to remove that half of the frame slider mount kit from there the fairing removal removal itself and exactly as it was before okay now we're ready to remove the fairing all the way from the bike once again were showing you this kind of cover the addition of that orangey no cut frame slider to the mix it definitely makes it a little bit different but at the end of the day it's really not too extreme all right just like that so we've got half of the frame slide or bracket off the other half is gonna remain in place okay now it's time to install it same deal that we showed you on the other side okay one difference here is going to be from the factory Yamaha added to the r6 this little stator cover protector this cover is really vulnerable so from the factory included this cover protector pretty minimal at the end of the day but it is there so to first remove that as this RG over cover will not slide over that okay we'll reinstall the fasteners before we take out the ones that need to be removed to install that over cover alright let's go ahead and line the cover up when I loop here here and up here okay there's the last one as always we're going to keep that I want to double check those two fasteners that I put it back in after we removed that factory protected okay now if we have three spacers a cover and of course the fasteners see if these hold in there slide that into place the one with the washer is going to go up here at the very top the other two per the instructions okay so maybe I did look at the instruction the other two do not use the washer make sure you keep your space you in play and I'll go ahead and get these started make sure it gets centered on that spacer to make sure they're all seated before we put any torque to them it's really important that they're all even if you're going to use a torque wrench now's the time you'd want to grab that there you have it there is your stiff side over cover install [Music]", "8jmE043zUPg": "game day today what are we playing what is this got her in something zombies undead nightmare zombies but you guys want to do for lunch well it's not lunchtime yet it's only 9 o'clock in the morning but just asking it's kind of happy outside today yes you can have a chicken taco something looks cool grabbing the time-lapse yeah been very busy this morning playing with them and you know picking up and doing other things but I gotta be in my shell and I did give them a workout in today feeling good feeling great feeling great well trying to feeling great still dealing with all about life issues but you drowned me turn out the X but hopefully this will be over soon so she can stop pulling this stuff on us we don't like drama we're gonna dance it up we're gonna put on our red shoes and dance it out cause it's trying to bring a smile to my face all right shower time [Music] okay so this video is going to be coolant flush 409 Yamaha r1 yeah that I got a help her today we got cats we're out here what's up a little cat lamb I got a helper today he's gonna be huge help so let's get in there quick right now and get started all right here she is as you can see the bike is all taken apart already I did that in a previous video when I replaced the neutral switch if you would like to see me taking plastics off and stuff I'll have a link down below to go to that and see me doing it it's really that hard but if you'd like to I also did a oil change and a speedo oil change video and a speedo sensor video which I'll also link below for you guys to see if you want to go take a look at them but as you can see this is what we'll be doing we're gonna do a coolant flush I already took the coolant reservoir off right here that is also in that neutral switch video if you'd like to see that again that's I'll link it below it's in the neutral switch one super easy to take that off I mean it's right there you guys can see it without even taking the plastics off well the drain to drain your coolant there's a screw yep right here it's right in your line well take that out drain it you want to wash your I'm gonna wash out the reservoir here I probably won't put that bit that on video but yeah just wash it out so it's cleaned and then our filler for our coolant is let me check is on the opposite side so what we're gonna have to do is take these plastics here right here these plastics maybe even this top piece right here we'll find out [Music] while astray and we're just going to take these sides off quick get that done simple quick save time all right see I'm actually going to leave this hang because I got my custom signals here taped on there so it shouldn't be in the way I should put some more tape on there who knows I might take it off we'll see but I took the cap off so the coolants gonna come out a lot quicker it up see still enough quick I better get over there to make sure the head pan is big enough big enough is it coming off fast buddy so I switch the pan you're very search panel huh I'm just gonna switch it out this guy was gonna get me one right but they're gonna and stop so we'll just let it drain for a couple more seconds and then we'll put it back together and put the new coolant in wow that's doing that I will mmm go clean off the reservoir which is we went nothing to do I'm not the male part should be ready here right here so we're gonna go clean out this reservoir while we let that drip dry a little more yeah it's pretty nasty in there if you can see and then put the new coolant in and fire up all right we're heading back out now got this guy rinsed out fairly well cleaned out basically just did a little CLR and some hot water shook it around let it soak a couple minutes up it's good so I mean if you really want to do it right you're fresh you let it like soak overnight or something but we're just in a quick flush so you know I should do it every season and we're doing it now we're back at it we're going to start putting some parts back on it and then fill it after we got some parts back on [Music] [Music] so we just got the chain guard back in as you seen and I put this cap in can be a little struggle because you got to have all these hoses tucked in right and everything it's not too bad it gives you any problems just kick it it usually works he's getting cleaning up rounds over there standing on the brass up at least a good are you making dominoes in the press dominoes with brass okay doesn't have anything to do at the break but it's it's cooler all right no I'm just gonna put these screws and put this reservoir back on or the overflow you know how you want to call it this screw back in down here since it's like not even dripping anymore put some caps on fill it up start it and then put it back all the rest back together [Music] [Music] well there we go as you can see it put perfect on screws in overflows back on wouldn't be going this faster this way without this guy yeah are you doing all the work he's doing all the work I'm just watching but we're getting her all right that's good I was gonna like the lens but yeah what a fate of course I think we're ready I put the floor break in then on slides really don't matter yet and put the shifter back on set any of that matter but we're putting it all back together Thank You next should we drop to it that was for the other things I was doing like I said link below really need to clean this baby up I think we're gonna fill the court now and start her up and yeah let's do that [Music] alright we got it a disposal go make help over there thumbs up okay uh da Jax has been helping me all day he wanted to Ryan helped me yesterday he gets help me today oh well I like their help their also find anyone out there you got her people anyways that's full goal is a bullet Lilly I can't talk says foes will go without running it I'm gonna run it now let it move through the cycle put a little more in if it needs it and we better hurry up cuz my frickin battery's almost dead well warm it up here in a second I just wanted to put the cat back on because it didn't sink down at all very very little so we're just going to put her back together and then let's keep an eye on it make sure it stays good yeah exhaust is over there playing smelling an exhaust that doesn't not good for you do not smell that not good for your lungs it's like smoking cigarettes yeah thundering thank you thanks I smell it anyways oh yeah so we'll meet him we're gonna put this back together and there you have it I'll let the camera run and if it dies it dies but lets you see us putting them back together [Music] and there you have it we're gonna call it back together just gotta tighten the tank down and put the seat on and it's done there's your flush oh nine Yamaha r1 flush I believe it works through there are two thousand nine to two thousand twelve or fourteen look that up so I'm almost positive it goes through two thousand twelve but I think it goes farther also I think they're pretty much the same there you go good luck if I can do it anybody can do it but I had help Jax was helping me know he's riding his bike around somewhere right there he riding the bike all right well I like my stuff subscribe like share on all your social media crap I don't know what everybody else says later bugs done letting a warm up get up the temperature cuz hasn't ran in a while written in here good help were you riding your bike cross-ice hey you're Pro now he's pro oh so that's a good day that's a good day got a lock down again feeling good about it", "oMAKX4Ca9I4": "this is my 2008 Yamaha r1 and the problem is it will randomly stall pulling up two lights you coast up the light pull the clutch in and the whole bike will just die it has been a problem in a lot of the oh seven and oh eight Yamaha are ones but it goes back to as far as 2004 when this problem started a lot of people think that it's a throttle position sensor some people think it's the ECU and some people think that this adjustment will fix the problem and I haven't heard any complaints about it yet so I'm going to show you what to do to fix the problem if you have Oh seven or eight Yamaha r1 that will just stall sometimes for no reason whenever the RPMs are low first thing you have to do is remove the gas tank which is very simple there's a screw right up there by the handlebars take that screw out and there's going to be a screw on each side right here and on the other side take those out you have to slide the panels that go off and go on the bike right here off they slide forward off the bike then you have to take off the screw that the gas tank hinges on right there and then you'll have to disconnect the two low fuel sensor wires disconnect the two overflow hoses disconnect the fuel line just squeeze it pull it off make sure you don't catch your bike on fire make sure it's not hot because fuel will squirt out it's still under pressure and then the fix is going to be the adjustment on the throttle bodies which is four screws there's one of them right there and there's going to be four of them one on each throttle body what you want to do is tighten that screw all the way clockwise and then give it 180 degree turn backwards so they tighten it all the way I already did to this one and then give it 180 degrees counterclockwise you're going to want to do that to all four of them there's one there the other ones are kind of hard to show with the camera but they all look exactly the same and they're all right in a row evenly spaced across the fuel rail here so adjust all for those put everything back together make sure you remember where all of them were adjusted to before you mess with it so that in case the bike doesn't run or runs worse or for some reason you have a problem with it you know what to adjust it back to some people recommend going back to the dealership and have them run on a dyno and balance all the throttle bodies I might do that I haven't decided yet I'm going to see how it runs after this adjustment so I hope this helps", "jkvDA1Cgm1w": "hi I'm gonna play daisy bell' or sometimes this is known as a bicycle built for two and this was a top 10 hit in 1893 for what the singer Dan Quinn and I'm using this book very good book the ukulele method book too and there won't be a stylish marriage I can't afford a carriage but you look sane the phone the saint of the bicycle built for two okay I'll show you all the chords for this we've got an F now in the book does that sound like this I'm gonna show you an easier way so there's your f you just put your finger three on fret three of string three so all the threes go that's an easier way of doing and we've got B flat it's the next one you also have a c7 and we have a D minor and a g7 that's it I'll just run those chords again and they're coming up on the screen for you as well f7 B flat C seven and D minor g7 okay the songs in three four so we've got three strings for each bar and what I'm gonna do is add some drums as we're gonna go one two and three and four each bar so be down down up down so we do that for three bars [Music] seven D minor 7 [Music] se7 [Music] c7 c7 [Music] okay I'm just gonna show you the melody and give you a super close-up boiled there so you can see the notes I'm playing on the first three strings of the ukulele [Music] all right a song we're just gonna do the first verse which is the question [Music] [Music]", "0UhmPxHtjsM": "all right pick with our six we're going to do a swap out the coin so this bike is a 2000 and I've never changed a coolant on it so it's pretty well overdue so I think what I'm going to do first is I'm going to drain all the coolant out and then I'm just gonna probably put a little bit of antifreeze in there and then I'm just going to run almost 100% water and you're going to do this be sure to get distilled water okay the distilled water doesn't have any minerals or anything in it so that's what you want to get then just got some stuff is pre-mixed so I'm going to start by take that cap off and up down here little 8-millimeter drain plug so aside I'll get that cap off take that drain off drain this out and definitely want to do this when everything is nice and cool definitely don't want to open up a cooling system the top all right got the cap off the radiator it's going to loosen this up all right so coming around to the left side of the bike I put the plug back in the drain plug back in the other side I got my pan over here got a couple of 10 millimeter bolts holding this reservoir in place so disconnect that and dump it out all right so after dumping it out I just filled it with some distilled water took a rag and cover this kind of shook it up did that like three times dump the water out and now I've got I filled it with distilled water to about the halfway mark in there I'll put it back on all right so I got to reattach got the two bolts back on there put the cap back on put the little overflow bottle line hooked up it's got to put these breather lines back through here all right so that's all set all right so I just loosen the screw up for that Ram air ducting it's still attached to the airbox I just took it off the front piece here and pushed it back got enough plane it's work and get this funnel on there so I'm going to fill it up with a little bit of antifreeze and then top it off with the water all right so I got it filled up to the top there and another thing I like to do is just you know squeeze on this hose kind of helps work some of the air bubbles out and I'm just going to let this sit with the cap off for probably like 20 minutes let's uh any of those air bubbles work their way out of there you should be ready to put the RAM air duct back on there and fire it up alright so got the radiator topped off water and I'm going to put that cap back on there fire this thing up and just let it run for like a minute or whatever I'm going to shut it down and take the cat back off should I push some of the air bubbles out of there it's like the levels gone down a little bit so I'm gonna let this kind of sit here for a couple minutes and top it off all right gonna finish up the coolant on the r6 so yeah I just put a hundred percent water in there initially when I changed everything and I've been running it for probably three or four days now I mean I probably put about somewhere between 60 and 100 miles on it with the water in there so now I'm going to drain all the water out and top it off with a 50/50 mix and throw a little water wetter in there got the a millimeter bolt to remove the drain and I got my screwdriver so I can take the ram air duct loose so I'm going to loosen that duct take that cap off of there and start draining it all right cap off there my America's up ready to start draining us all right so when it's all done draining let's get your drain plug cleaned up reinstall it make sure you snug it up should be good all right so coming around to the other side of the bike drain pan over here a couple of ten mills that hold the bottle on I'm going to take these uh fuel tank breathers out of here and there's our overflow lines got to be taken off so I'll dump this bottle out and I'll put some fresh coins in there so after you empty it I just fill it about halfway between the two marks there get something in there can always top it off later if it needs it reinstall this all right got the bottle back on cap back on there the tube plug back in to mounting bolts and the breather hoses for the gas tank tucked back in there ready to start filling it got this bottle half full so ready to fill the radiator got the funnel ready to go got the 50-50 mix coins and my water wetter so going to put a little bit of Coulomb in there I'm going to put about two or three ounces of that water wetter in there and top it off with the coolant not going to like fill it all the way up going to get it pretty close to the top and run the bike try to bleed some of the air out for a go topping it off I got it filled right now it's probably a couple inches below that fill cap so what I'm going to do I'm just going to set the cap on there start the bike up and let it run for a little bit all right so now I'll going to put the cap on completely and let it get up the operating temperature all right fangirls kicked on all right so after running it let it just sit for about an hour let it all cool down took the cap off pretty much filled to the top so I'm going to put the cap back on and get that Ram air duct reattached all right got it all finished up so the other thing you want to do make sure you know you keep an eye on that drain make sure that it's not leaking so keep an eye on that in the future and keep an eye on that overflow bottle and top it off if you have to", "sIS5G7cA48U": "hi my name is EDA and today I will teach you five basic tracking patterns that you can use with your ukulele this is a part of my ukulele 101 series and I will link to the playlist up here with some helpful tips and I also have a beginner video with all of the like information about this instrument and the strings and the number of the fingers and all of that stuff so if you're just starting out then I would recommend you watch that first I'm but yeah today we are talking about plucking patterns and I have five basic ones to show you I will start with the easiest one and then we will advance from that basics first we are going to use our thumb and our three middle fingers and we are going to place our thumb on the top string and this is going to kind of pluck or strum downwards so we go from above the string and then down and the other three fingers are going to be placed on the three lowest strings and they are going to be plucking upwards and for all of these patterns we are going to use the same fingers on the same string so it's so good to just get used to leaving the fingers on their own strings and with my left hand I'm just going to play C and G and a minor and F those are the four chords that I taught in my first beginner ukulele video just so that you get the idea of how these patterns sound when you play chords so for the first one we are going down on the strings so that sounds like this thumb first finger second finger and third finger and with the chords it sounds like this [Music] and as you can hear I used my thumb to strum a bit harder than the rest of the fingers so that we get this lingering effect of the first string that we strum or pluck and even though this is a kind of simple pattern I think this gives it an interesting effect and I can sound really nice okay so for the second plucking pattern it's kind of similar because we go down first let me go up and down again so this is good if you have chords that lasts longer than just these four beats so for this we use our thumb and then first second and third finger and then the second again and the first and the second and the third so down and then up on the two middle strings and then down on the two lowest strings with the chords it sounds like this [Music] I also pluck a bit harder with the third finger on the bottom string and this is also to get the more kind of interesting effect so a bit faster it sounds like this and as you can hear when I move from the C to the G I move my finger along the bottom string so when I pluck a bit harder on that string we get this effect that's a nice bonus okay for the third plucking pattern we are going to start with our three middle fingers and we are going to be plucking upwards so it sounds like this using those fingers and we are also going to be adding the song so the thumb will be plucking at the same time as the third finger so on the first beats [Music] to do it a bit slower with all of the chords it sounds like this what I like about this plucking pattern is that even if we are in a time signature that is divided by four it gives it a more kind of interesting time sound because we have not four and then four but we have three three and two so this is more clear if you talk a bit harder with your third finger on the bottom string then you get this effect and you can also use this bucking pattern if you are playing a song with the time signature on three and then it sounds like this so then we of course don't do the two last plucks and the feel of the song is different so yeah for the fourth pattern we are not going to just pluck on even beats we are going to let one of the notes linger and that sounds like this [Music] this is one of my favorites for this we plug it down and then we left the bottom string linger and then we go up with our second and first finger and then down with our second finger again so with the chords it sounds like this and for this one as well it sounds nice if you pluck a bit harder with your third finger because that is the one that is lingering and that gives a cool effect now I'm going to play it a bit faster with the chords so you see how that sounds yeah I use this a lot I really like it and so for the fifth and last pattern this is also one of my most used ones this is this one for this we are actually only going to use two fingers I'm using my first and third finger and I'm just like English drums like this [Music] with the chords we get this I can do it emits network [Music] now you see a challenge because since we are only using two of the strings sometimes the chords won't sound right because not all of the chords tones are included and this is especially a problem if the chords are only played on the strings that we are not so for this we got a problem with a minor and F they sound the same and if you don't want your chords to sound the same then you can of course pluck some other strings and we can use the same kind of pattern with for instance the two bottom strings so then we use our second and third finger so now we can hear the difference between the a minor and the F and what strings that you will be plucking depends on what kind of song you are playing and what chords are in that song you know you think sound the nicest but I really like this kind of rhythm that happens with this it gets a bit interesting I mean you can build up something when you're using this pattern so yeah those were my five favorite patterns I hope this was helpful if you have any questions about this just leave them in the comments and also tell me if you have any other ukulele related content you would like me to make videos about I'm happy to do ukulele beginning your videos so I just let me know if you have any questions or problems with playing ukulele and I will help you out so yeah remember to subscribe I do a lot of ukulele content so if you're watching this video then maybe you like ukulele content I'm just taking a guess I don't know so yeah remember to subscribe to see more and give this video with something if you liked it and I will see you soon okay bye for the third pattern yeah", "xoVi5QsrOug": "got a 2006 r6 year with a moderate oil leak I noticed as I'm writing and when I parked the bike I have at least four to five drops when I come back in the garage in the morning as you can see there's oil residue a lot of buildup at the very front and then it runs all the way down the faring that's the right side and on the left you can see all the build-up to and running on the inside of that left fairing and a little bit creeping on the outside so I took off all the right side or the middle lower fairings on the right side I was trying to trace it I noticed that the oil does start about right here and then I worked my way up I noticed it wasn't from the fill plug because the oil is above that so I kept going up and I noticed that it stopped right about there more on the inside of the motor so I looked behind the frame beginning of the swingarm I noticed that there's this control box here with a wire harness and some steel cables I went ahead and took that out those that harness or not highness but the the bracket for this piece goes or right here I think it's eight millimeter so I push this out of the way and then I also removed one bolt here to take off the brake reservoir so once I had those out of the way notice in the back there's the oil pressure sensor so I noticed that that was full of oil residue as well and and I wiped that off there's no oil above that but all the oil is dripping down below it you see that we'll get a better shot was to focus there we go so I got my hand in there and noticed it was only a finger tight it wasn't uh these are very loose so I'm gonna take that out and possibly even put some plumbers tape around that and really tighten it up get a good seal and that should fix it alright hope that helps", "D80J4ohxB4U": "ah bribe and sportbiketrackgear.com and man look what happened this is that 2017 our six project like that we've been working on for one of our local riders Brian did all kinds of cool stuff to this he took it for the first track day of the year and went down on the very first lap of the year the reality is happens right you're out there you're riding on the street or on the track things can happen and as you can see they happen to ride [Music] the stuffs possible that's why you put all these pieces on there the sliders that covers all that stuff to try and help minimize damage he really was pretty fortunate end of the day the our jury RG frame slider did a great job that worked the driven lever Gardner that worked great too we do have a little bit of damage that were repairing that's the purpose of this video this had the orangey cover protector over it you can see the video that we did on that the crash that he had was kind of unique and I don't know if it was a problem with the product itself okay that the design of the over cover or just the nature of the crash because these are used and pretty superb like they've been crashed on before hundred hour six that's for sure but what ended up happening was the bull right here when the Blake impacted the ground was a slow-speed crash cold track cold tires of course Ryan come on buddy be smarter next time right and try to sleep the day before you ride the bull impacted bent the bolt and it put a crack in the OEM cover so we're gonna upgrade them into the woodcraft full stator cover you can see compared to an OEM cover this is way more robust you're not breaking this you're probably break the motor case before you break this these are designed to manage that impact they also have a replaceable slider puck which of course I chose blue because if I were to let Ryan choose it he would have chose black who likes black and you can have blue okay so let's go ahead and jump in and it's also going to give us a shout out to he was riding with a sport bike track time the Grattan Raceway when he had this incident the staff at stt jumped in and they helped him get the bike back together made a little repair here so the fluid was no longer coming out right she had a little bit of oil leak in this area you certainly don't want to ride like that it's a friend of mine and one of the staffers at stt helped Brian get his flight back out got him back out riding he wrote on Saturday and then went out Sunday and had good day of rotting so back on track and that's that whole track community really come together stt is a quality organization if you haven't written with them before you're in the Midwest I definitely recommend it so installation of this cover this is fairly straight forward over a wood craft they do a great job with the instructions always very thorough so I encourage you to look at those each bikes a little bit different for what we're doing here begin by taking off this Nance with j-b weld bull they put in there okay the rest of them will be five mill this particular wood craft cover ships complete with a new gasket I do have some high temp silicone that we're gonna be using to I'll show you where we'll use that why we will be using that on this install we're going to get our fasteners out and then remove the cover like so at the end of the day this really is a pretty easy install and you can see right here you know that's the difference with a oh we cover this is just cast okay that crack right there much more brittle nowhere near as strong as this machined piece of billet aluminum okay so you know how when I do these install videos I'm always telling you keep all your OE hardware that's what I do that's what I've done over the years this is just a small sampling I got boxes this stuff over there so obviously I'm not putting this thing back in there okay that's something that my buddy Dave probably dug out of his spares I'm taking that definitely not putting this Boult back and there was throwing that one out okay but I was able to find enough fasteners so we can put this all back together with nice Oh II style stuff okay because you want to do a good job keep all your stuff now the gasket the OE gasket is still on the motor case you'll be able to pull most of it off okay so go ahead and pull that off like so I need to scrape the surface you want to watch and try to really minimize the debris but you get inside the motor case so I'm gonna scrape this stuff comes off relatively easy and I'm trying to do it in a way where everything falls outside pretty sure Ryan just changed the oil realistically best practice here would be change the oil right after you're done here being open and honest I have done this more than once without changing oil after the fact if you're smart about it and you do a good clean job you can get away with it okay I've got the surface scraped we're gonna clean it in a minute and I'll show you what I'm going to put the silicone sealant okay but right now we need to mount up our skid plate so we'll get that ready to roll they do recommend that you use a little bit of blue here I'm gonna second that motion because the bolts for this aren't behind the cover okay see the only way to get too old is to pull the cover off and you know if one of them happens to be just worked its way a little bit loose that's not going to be any fun and then we'll go ahead and torque all those down obviously before we get the cover on it's a cool design too because that skid plates actually replaceable and a lot of times if you do happen to fall on this cover like I said they hold up really really well oftentimes you're able to replace just that skid pad kind of freshen the cover up these are obviously available as replacement items go ahead and torque those all down wipe off the excess and then run to clean the engine case for that I'm just gonna use a little brake cleaner here on right really any degreaser is gonna get this job done for you if you want this to seal it's definitely important that the surfaces are clean and dry the area where the oil will like to run a little bit as right down here at the bottom so what I'll typically do is wipe back into the engine case just a little bit and what that'll do is slow it down from running now I'm gonna get just a little bit this high temp you want to use it right in this area here it's just to deal with any imperfections from the harness there and there's a split in the case right here so you don't need a bunch just a bit also on the case you can see that dowel okay that needs to come off let's lay it into position there now we're ready for our gasket to cover a little bit of silicone is going to kind of help hold the gasket there for us you need to get the cover lined up with those two dolls as you slide it over like so your bolts may look just a little bit different than what we have here you remember the OE bolts were gone and we took those out and we replace the install that over cover get the bolts started do not run anything down until you have all of them started so no final torque now just get them started we'll do this going all the way around the cover the two bolts down here that hold the clutch cable bracket are usually a little longer in length than the rest as a reference also when you're done it's a really good idea to start it and warm it and check it for leaks then of course check it as it heats oaks and cools down I'd love to do that except for Ryan has the key in his pocket so we will not be doing that on camera but rest assured it will happen before he goes out and rides again next as you can see this is a pretty basic project I think most writers would be able to handle this especially if you track doing track stuff you know it's you're gonna have the tools and supplies necessary to get this done now I'll just kind of run around it get them all the seat if you like to use a torque wrench and I'll be a good time to go grab that research your torque spec I typically do not use a torque wrench because I like people giving me a hard time get them all the seat nice and even still once again no final torque here and then what I'll do is I'll just cross over okay once you have all the bolts just run down and seat it evenly using kind of a crisscross pattern remember if you want to use a torque wrench rock it out man go for it go grab one apply final torque now what I like to do from there I'll just kind of run around it make sure I've got them all and that they're all even secure that like so there you have it if I had the key if Ryan would have given me the key well now I'd start the bike guide run it and check for leaks absolutely do not ride this motorcycle until you check for leaks and also remember best practice with this is do an oil change after you do this you don't want to any of that debris inside the motor I'm gonna let Ryan know if he wants to do that he absolutely can I feel like I did a pretty clean job I think at the end of the day that he is gonna be a-okay right so if he doesn't want to do it he'll be good to go the moral to this story is right when you go out these cold weather days be extra careful take your time if you're all rushed and hurried and maybe if you only slept two hours the night before and you're scurry and even get out on track maybe you should pump the brakes take a deep breath and wait until you're a hundred percent ready and now this isn't just a feet up on Ryan's story because let me tell you I have done some stuff that's way dumber than what he did if you rewind the clock little bit there was a time that I went out and took one of the owners of score flight track time way in the day the previous owners one of their bikes actually Monty's wife Bonnie took her bike I was gonna scrub in her new pilot power tyres and guess what man I didn't even make it pit out a ginger man and I'd crashed that bike and I got to put it in my trailer take it home and paint it so happens be ready for it and always pick the bike up put it back together and get back out there I'm Brian van this is our woodcraft stator cover install in the 2017 crashed our six STG project light [Music]", "fwRmt6BSkSQ": "today I'm going to be doing a coolant change finally making a video in the daytime so I've got two jugs of engine ice because they think they're two quarts each and we're going to need three quarts and I got a gallon of distilled water to flush the system so I'm going to take off this panel and this cowl at the bottom and the bottom cow on the other side as well so I'm gonna stop this video real quick well we also have to get the rivets on the inside so I'm gonna stop the video real quickly like so when you finally get to this point you'll notice as I just did that Yamaha put their coolant fill cap in a not so easy place to get to so I had to go and take off the ram air tube as well it's pretty straightforward the only little tricky piece is this one pop rivet will be underneath here and that's the only not terribly obvious piece but otherwise has just I took off the plastic piece first took off the rubber boot and then disassembled backwards and eventually I get this mess so I'm going to continue now that I have a clear access to the fill cap I'm going to continue taking off the lower cowls so that we can drain it from the other side so now I've taken off the lower fairing on this side you can leave the side cowl still attached just undo these two and the third one that connects there so I just pulled that right off and now we can see the coolant drain plug right here we'll take this off later to drain all the coolant out but for now I'm just going to take off the coolant reservoir cover and see what we've got underneath there so you get a color up just took off these two bolts and now it looks like just to make our lives fun we've got these two to take off to get the reservoir off just so we can dump it and fill it with some newer stuff and clean it all out so I'm gonna go ahead and take these two off and get back to you after that so I took off those two bolts like I said and it looks like this will just slide on out of here and there we go I'm going to go ahead and clean this sucker out so I dumped it out and I've got that nice green puke in there and in here you can see that dark spot down there has a bunch of crud build-up so I'm going to fill this with some distilled water shake it all around and hopefully get that cleaned up in there now that I've got the reservoir cleaned out a little bit I put my catch pan underneath I'm going to go ahead and take off make sure your bike is definitely cold before you do all this or else you're going to get burnt pretty bad so I'm going to go ahead and take off my reservoir fill cap and make a little bit of a mess and then go around the other side again and take off that a that drain drain nut right here and I'll go back one up so I took that off and now we've got a nice little stream of green coming on out we're going to let that drain completely and then start to flush it with some distilled water now that the stream is pretty much stopped I'm going to go ahead and start running the distilled water through the open cap here and just wait until it starts coming out clean at the bottom you can see the stream pretty much turned clear so now I'm just going to let that finish used up most of my distilled water here so I'm going to let that finish and then I'm going to put the drain bolt back on and start filling it with the engine ice I'll get back to you at that point now I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to put the engine ice into the reservoir and fill it to about halfway between the low and full and then I'm going to reattach the reservoir the reason I'm doing halfway between is just in case when we're running the first time if anything comes out I wanted to get to full but if need be I will fill it at that point so and so I got my coolant reservoir back in place you can see the line I chose right there if need be I'll put some more back in when we're done but for now I'm going to leave it right there and drain plug is reinstalled and now I'm going to go ahead and start refilling the radiator up until it is until you can see it at the top there and then we're going to run it and get the air out so I'm going to go ahead and fill up my radiator with the engine ice so now I'm going to restart the bike now that I've got it filled if you can see pretty much to the top there I'm going to start the bike up and let it run for a little bit get that radio fluid to drop down a little bit get all the air out and then I'll refill it and top it off again bubbling a little bit you can see the temperature climbing I'm going to stop when it hits about 170 180 we've got 170 now 176 178 I really see any more bubbles coming out and but there we go now we got some bubbles coming and apparently engine ice is doing pretty good because never got down to 167 so temperature seems to be holding here pretty good which I'm in Florida so that's pretty darn good we got a couple of revs in the pool and went ahead and disappeared now we're at 180 187 189 go ahead and stop about now and we top it off so now we're all tapped off again keeps draining slowly or getting less in there very slowly and I just been keeping topping it off until it seems to stabilize and then I'm going to go ahead and put the cap back on and start putting all the fairings back on now putting it all back together I got the lower Cal's on lower fairings and just put this piece on with this bolt and this bolt next I'm going to grab the back section of the air tube pop it right in there let me get the back piece on remember there's the fatter pop rivet that goes on underneath that's the only piece for this section then I'm going to go ahead and put back on the rubber tube pop right into there and right in place then with that back on nice and tight we can go ahead and put these last two pieces of plastic on this one and this one and then pop the last fairing back on and I'm going to pretty much leave it there that's everything that you should be done with and keep an eye on your coolant levels make sure there's no leaks next couple of days if you need to if you notice it's getting a little too hot or the reservoir falls below where it should be just go ahead and retype it off make sure you do it when it's cold not when it's hot or else you're going to get burnt so again keep the an eye on the levels the next few days and you're good to go just to follow up I've had my bike running for probably 10 to 15 minutes now and temperatures at 185 it's going up as high as about 192 the holding pretty steady at about 185 so looks like everything came out okay and there you have it all done", "6A7c-2dtMmM": "this is a message to shade tree mechanic this is not a gasket this is a gasket use

two droppers full and applying that directly to my scalp and using my fingertips to make sure i rub that in very well and then you're going to take another dropper full and apply that from basically your ears down if you have a bore bristle brush use that to help it evenly distribute the product if you don't it's okay you can just use a regular brush but what this is going to do it is going to make sure that your scalp is staying hydrated it's going to mimic your own scalp oil production so that your hair is not too oily or too dry and it's also going to provide some amazing results with your other monet hair care products throwing it a hat and you're good to go", "5YPfEpkfuy8": "hello and welcome to my channel today I just decided to make a short video on how to strain your herbs after you've infused the oil with the herbs now I typically infuse my herbs for about five to six weeks and when you do that you want to make sure you use dried herbs at the time you can see my other videos on how to do that so for today you will just need your herbal infusion a measuring cup cheesecloth and whatever vessels you'll be transferring into okay so this is a very simple process this is a couple different mixes I made sage lavender and patchouli and then the other mix I used a plantain lavender lemon balm peppermint and chamomile so I made these bruised if you will with the intention of just soothing and softening the skin among the other medicinal properties these herbs have as far as healing the skin and different skin conditions so just start off with your cheesecloth you can just I just keep it real simple I just lay the cheesecloth over over it and just start to strain my herbs and I use my hand as the herbs start to weigh down as you can see I almost lost my herbs and my oil but that's okay I want to show you what can happen as you're you know doing this all yourself it's not always perfect so I reused my cheesecloth and just going to do the next batch which you might have saw me catch a second whiff of that oil smelled so good that was the lavender chamomile lemon balm just smelled amazing and of course I don't intend on going anywhere so I'm just gonna lather this oil all over my body and boy did it feel nice to feel just a homemade skin care on my on my body it was amazing so next I'm going to do a second strain which you don't necessarily have to but I found at the bottom there are little tiny plant materials left and so I strain it a second time as I put it in my final vessel the measuring cup my juice makes it very easy to pour as well and this takes time I real they sped up the process here so after I clean off my bottle and this may be an oily mass no big deal I just label my oil of all the herbs that I infused into the oil the date I started the infusion and the date that I bottled it and you can store your oil and a cool and dark place it's okay if you use a clear bottle just keep it out of direct sunlight at this point and there you go okay and of course oil infusions like this can be added and made in two selves if you wanted to add some part oil some part coconut oil or what have you and I'll make more videos on that it's always good to use your oils within a year usually the longevity is is pretty lengthy especially if you use dried herbs which take out all the moisture of the plant and prevent the plant the oil from going rancid if there is anything that I might not have answered in this video please comment below and I'd be happy to answer your questions and don't forget to subscribe for more videos have a

to teach us about propers and she is an expert in this field i'm going to go ahead and have her introduce herself if you can mute yourself then we can have the best listening experience to cynthia okay thank you awesome saturday or sunday now tina is there a way for me to share my screen can i go ahead and share this yes absolutely okay thank you okay so i'll just jump right in so i um i'm in a little town called sea shelter we're on the sunshine coast of bc and if you know vancouver it is um we have to take a ferry to get here but it's part of the the mainland so um you know the it's sort of like all these little peninsulas of of um you know land johnnie into the water lots of inlets so we are looking straight at an inlet it's absolutely the most beautiful view and we found this place actually from a vision board we created a vision board when i decided i wanted to have a healing retreat and it kind of goes back way before i even created the vision board but when we found this place it was within our budget it was what we wanted to do and um when we went home we looked at the picture that we had put up on our vision board i mean we look at it every day but it's not like you're looking for that particular house the house that we found is almost identical to the house and the vision board so i am i am so 100 percent into vision boards and i think we got a little bit um can you still hear me am i am i freezing up frozen on darlene's iphone okay cynthia i think we had a momentary lapse in connection so okay i need to kind of rewind a little bit sure sure yeah um i hope it wasn't my internet was it i don't think so okay okay well i was just saying that we we have a place on the sunshine coast of bc it is a ferry ride from vancouver about 40 minutes it's not the island but it is the the mainland but you just need a um a fairy to get here and you know years ago i um i started getting into the subconscious mind and meditating and i just thought it was so wonderful how it helped me that i wanted to create a place where people could come and learn how to do this and of course you know life gets in the way and um you know you have to do what what you do to make a living and of course this was going back 25 years ago we're still good to tina yes we're great okay um but what we did was um you know we sort of came to a place where we thought we let's start looking for something that would work as a healing retreat because that's what we have here um i'm a clinical hypnotherapist i do energy work um reiki i do sound healing that sort of thing so it's a whole sort of you know a few days of staying with me and having me nurture you and and cook for you and and we do healing sessions it was a wonderful way to um you know just sort of meet new people like it's just incredible the people that come but of course when covet hit i'm not doing that anymore but the story i wanted to tell you was how this place came about i don't know do you know what a vision board is tina have you seen a vision board have you made them yes yes i make them and my team makes them too awesome well they work okay because i've used them a few different times and i have vision boards up on in my my bedroom but gary and i made it together we started to make a list of all the things that we wanted here um you know we wanted to be near the water or we wanted to be able to see the water we wanted to be close to the the trees we wanted a quiet place we were looking for a retreat setting and we picked a picture out of a magazine that was just an ordinary looking house and i just sort of had in my mind that it might be an organic farm or you know like something sort of more rustic well we came across this house um you know after maybe two years of looking and we found something within our budget it was a little more than what i thought it would be as far as what it offered it wasn't rustic it wasn't an organic farm but the setting of it because we look right at the inlet all levels the three levels of the the i mean it's a house basically that we've created a retreat in you can see the water you can see the mountains you can see the big sky so the water is very healing right and so the setting is perfect well we made an offer on this house we went home and it was gary actually that said you know the house we just put an offer on looks an awful lot like this house on the vision board and it was pretty much exactly the same it was three levels it looked out over something you could see that it was you know up high it had cedar hedges around it there's lots of windows even though the driveway was at the right angle and we have three steps going down to our front yard and this house had three steps going down to the front yard so it sort of blew my mind that after looking at this picture for two years plus and we keep adding things to that vision board that we actually came across exactly what was needed and then things started to unfold my favorite flower started blooming in the draw you know along the driveway um you know we we turned one of the rooms into a bed and breakfast which is just the most brilliant thing to do at least for me at that time and so i guess the point that i want to make is that there is energy in everything okay and that's what we're going to talk about tonight is energy there's energy in your words there's energy in your thoughts and the chakras are part of our energy system okay the um the picture that you see up here can everybody see the screen okay i hope so this this has the the chocolate colors the the red the orange the yellow the green the blue the um indigo and then the the yellow at the top and i mean they can shift and change a little bit but this is really about energy and how to recognize what is going on with your energy okay so i i love energy i love um you know just sort of the implications you can shift the energy of a room just by doing one thing or by diffusing a different oil and we all know that right um you can shift your thinking just by a comment that someone makes to you so what we want to do is pay attention to what we're exposing ourselves to right the energy that we're we're letting ourselves be affected by every day and it's and that's all about creating boundaries and figuring out what's right for you listening to your intuition and all that kind of stuff right so what we're going to do first of all is i'm going to talk a little bit about why i get so excited about doterra and why these oils are so fabulous i'm sure you already have heard the story but it just um is part of all my presentations um i've told you a little bit about me and then we're gonna start with the um the root chakra and talk about that and then we're going to have a little question and answer if you have any questions at all we're going to open it up and then i'll do the next chakra the orange one right and then we'll have a few questions if you want so that i want you to use your oils and be part of the the um you know the doing part of this so please uh feel free to chat or um you know when those questions and answers times come up please have your questions ready okay so let's get started so these are the two main energy systems that we have in our bodies the meridians are what reflexology is based on these are um sort of flows of energy that flow through our body and this is what dr hill has based his aromatouch technique on okay if anyone has taken that program or practiced that on anyone it you you actually follow the meridians with the oils okay and you'd go on the shoulders and then of course it has a whole wonderful hand technique that you use so that is um the 12 meridians and they're they're related to different parts of our body as well as organs right and this has been used for thousands of years um but reflexology a lot of masseuse you know use this as a basis and then on the right hand side we have the chakra energy systems so chakra actually means wheel or disc or spinning wheel and we have these seven major ones that we're going to talk about and again there's the colors there's again used for thousands of years and i just want to sort of preface this by saying that just because the the root like the one at the base of your spine shows up as red in most displays or presentations it doesn't always show up as red for people so um same with the emblem sometimes the emblems are um are the symbols they're ancient right so there's lots of interpretations of them and um this is just sort of what i've been using for the last 20 25 years or so i started taking reiki in 91 i learned how to use it and that was sort of the the energetic piece that really made everything come together for me in my life so this is why doterra is so important to me you know they have the mindset that they're going to change the world and i think that as soon as everybody sort of jumps on board who is who's a wellness advocate at least and has this mindset to to that they are also changing the world and doterra has your back in doing that right we're we're giving oils we're helping we're really making a difference in the world and of course it's the health and wellness industry like what a perfect industry to be in if ever there was this is how you're going to live longer right to be in this industry certified pure tested essential oils we know that what they are delivering to our door are pure they've been tested so many times they have the the correct chemical components of what that natural plant has to be able to look after all our ailments that that you know all these symptoms that we have right co-impact sourcing how could it get any better than this we are supporting indigenous farmers and harvesters around the world to help us to bring these to our home they're supporting their families they're they're loving what they're doing because they know how to do it and they're doing it well generations of knowledge is what they have and they're sharing it so of course they're going to be happy being able to to do that right and then the helping hands foundation what a beautiful thing that is like they have partnered with so many other you know sort of people that do their own thing and then they partner with doterra and doterra just amplifies it like it's just incredible all the different um organizations that are already helping people worldwide and doterra just just lifts them up so that they can do so much more now of course natural alternative solutions that actually work there's lots of choices out there but these actually work and we know that with all the stories that that we have right i love my awesome points plan this is where it makes me happy this year i had enough points that i bought a bottle of rose oil and i think i i it cost me like 15 in shipping i was so thrilled so now i've got this beautiful rose oil that i'm going to talk about that a little bit later and of course residual income residual income i was told very recently is an asset and i i believe it it once you build that up it's there for you right so um it's just all these things that that just make me so happy that i've decided to go hand in hand with doterra i know they've got my back they've got the same mindset as i do to um make a difference in the world and i'm just so happy that that they're here now if you haven't tried out source2you.com go check it out you can actually put your um your number that's on the bottom of your oil into the the website and it will show you exactly the tests that you've done that they've done on that particular batch where it's been sourced and there's a lot of really good information there so make sure you check that out so that's that's really what um i i think that doterra is all about so this is the first of the chakras we're going to talk about and as i mentioned chakra is a um is a wheel it means wheel or spinning uh disc and the root chakra is located at the base of your spine and this is the one that that flows downward it's really the one that grounds you to mother earth okay even if you're in a plane that chakra would be flowing down as much as it possibly could to to sort of um connect you to mother earth and it's um it's function really is stability safety and security and all those sort of traits that come when you feel safe in your own home when you feel that everything is you know okay and of course this past year so many people it feels like they've had the you know the carpet ripped out from under their feet and we're feeling unstable we don't know what's going to be the future and i mean we're starting to turn a corner but it's been kind of crazy for a lot of people lots of struggles and that sort of thing so if you're feeling unsettled your root chakra could probably use a little bit of meditation a little bit of oils or just get to the trees okay this is a beautiful place to connect with mother earth if you possibly can even touch the trees i always tell my clients to go and create a relationship with the tree i have a beautiful big cedar tree out beside my deck and i've loved that tree ever since we moved in eight years ago and it's it just sort of seems to speak to me it's kind of magical but this this particular trail this forest that i have a picture up here there's actually ancient trees in there that when you wrap your arms around the trees you need about six people to get around the tree um so if you're lucky enough to get to anywhere like that even a park you know someplace where you can go and sit and lean up against the tree or sit on the ground you know feel the grass this is where you're going to feel grounded you're going to feel settled you're going to really feel like it's um you know you're meant to be here we're all part of mother earth we're we're energy bubbles and um you know we're we're part of all that is the roller uh recipe that i've got up here where there's going to be one on each one 10 ml roller you put these oils in here so two of geranium one of cinnamon three of wild orange two of ylang ylang and two sir yep two and two of patchouli and then top it up with your favorite carrier oil and what you can do with this this uh particular roller is when you sit cross-legged just rub it on the insides of your thighs because this is really where your energy is and where it starts and what we're going to do is do a little meditation here or at least get you to close your eyes in a moment the alternatives that you could do um if you don't have any of these or if you just want to use one oil tonight arborvitae myrrh black spruce these are lovely oils to help you get grounded in fact the um the myrrh is the oil of mother earth and that's really from this book and that's why i mentioned this book because it's um it's the oil that that is i guess represents mother earth and all the things that she brings and uh of course this one the element that it represents is earth so it makes sense that this is this is you know maybe get into the garden um you know been thinking about uh repotting some plants just digging in the dirt is going to get you back into feeling like you're grounded okay so what i'd like you to do if you'd like to just take a nice deep breath and close your eyes what i'm going to get you to do is just imagine and you can put one of your oils on right now if you want before you do that maybe that's a good idea just take one of those oils i've got a black spruce here and just inhale that and when you're ready just take a nice deep breath and let your let your thoughts let your imagination go into your spine and let your your your inner eye go down into the base of your spine and the base of your spine really is where you know your sit bones imagine this energy and we'll just imagine that it's a red energy and it's flowing down to mother earth okay so i want you to imagine this chakra this root chakra opening up and flowing easily i want you to imagine the red color i want you to imagine a balanced i want you to imagine that this it's this disc that is flowing around and it's going down into mother earth so even if you're in an apartment just imagine your energy flowing down through all the floors down through the basement down through the cement down through the the stones and the rocks and the different layers of mother earth down into the core of mother earth so that you could actually imagine the molten lava and there's this fire this heat that is going to come right back up and you're going to pull that energy right back up so you're bringing the energy of mother earth into your body through the base of your spine and just letting that be for a moment just imagine that that fire that earth element that feeling of being grounded and just allow that energy center to open let it be flowing let it be free let it be balanced don't worry about which way it's supposed to flow just sort of imagine it in its perfect state in its perfect balance state okay and when you're ready you can just open your eyes and i'm just wondering if there's any questions about this one [Music] sure if there's anything in the chat cynthia yes hi it's kathleen hi how are you doing really good nice to see you i don't really care for patchouli okay what's an alternative for patchouli or just leave it out are you making are you mixing up the um the roller yes okay um so you don't you don't use it at all no there's nothing i use with patchouli okay patchouli is quite um it's a it's the oil of physicality um i'm thinking grapefruit might be a good one do you like grapefruit i know it sounds sort of funny but i don't know how that's going to be in the recipe but grapefruit i believe is the oil of um self-esteem or something honoring the body right so patchouli is the the physicality and grapefruit is honoring the body so very similar essence even though it's um completely different oil it's the it's the essence and the meaning of it that i'm thinking of does that make sense okay yeah i'm a child of the 60s yeah and there was a lot of patchouli burnt to hide weed yeah i know i know and sandalwood and yeah i know anybody have any feedback on the little visualization were you able to imagine your root chakra yeah i really liked what you had to say this is dr tina yes and um because i remember the first picture that you had of the female sitting in a like a crisscross applesauce with the red thighs yes i know that's what i love pictures yeah yeah yeah and then and then we you know we were studying about the layers of the earth and i could imagine the lava in the middle of the earth coming up yeah so that was cool that was a neat visualization and i have a question about that slide you have like asterixes by the oils it's like one after could mean one drop three three drops okay yeah thank you so much yeah no worries yeah sorry i used my armamite um during that and and rvta you know is a is a great red cedar right yes yeah yeah and the yeah the cedar wood is nice too um yeah i've got some of my um my artwork in here i'm going to talk about that a little bit later too okay so this is the sacral chakra so this is your lower abdomen basically your reproductive organs you know your everything that is just below your navel right and so it is the it is the center of creativity this is where we procreate this is where we are able to create from within if you've got a project or if you're an artist or if you're um you know if you're always producing things right and um you know i think one of the things that that happened to me this year was that there was different times that i just wasn't motivated because i was sort of feeling like where where what am i doing where am i going i just feel so lost i wasn't able to have anybody into my home and that's what i had built up over the last you know six seven years and i just felt like i i wasn't clear on what i was gonna do it gave me more time to work on the oils but i really felt like something had to change something had to click for me to be able to get a focus right and i always say that well this is the water element this sacral chakra the creativity one but it's water is an emotional it's related to the emotions because it's fluid and it is um flexible just like our emotions right so um if you can get to the water water heals and i am i know i live on the water but it's sort of like after a while and i mean the winter is sort of funny too because the fox sort of comes in so you don't get this clear view right this is our view of the of the retreat but it's sort of like when it's there we're always in awe of it like every day it's like oh wow you know and but it's still i don't say it doesn't motivate me but it it just is not the same as just going away for a few days you know what i mean but when you go to the beach that's where it is that's where you really feel it the waves flowing in and out the idea that i mean this is the ocean right the idea that the moon moves the ocean with gravity like that's just a miracle to me you know and so i think the power in that sort of helps to to give you something because we're so in awe of life that we get to experience this right like it's it's that mindset again like let's really get down to basics here am i really going to worry about you know maybe what somebody said at a meeting or that this person hasn't called me back or that's not what your life is about your life is about feeling gracious and joyful and and you know having appreciation for being here i'll never forget one of my first guests stayed in the room upstairs and it was a clear clear night that day it was it was a warm night and she was able to you know lay out on the deck and watch the stars and she said i just laid there i felt like i was so fortunate to be alive and that she got that from the stars you know what i mean like nature gives us so much the roll on here is two of ylang ylang three of wild orange three of clary sage and two of ginger and alternatives it's interesting because the recipes i was going to tell you it came from someone else that actually does the work with the chakras the alternatives are my choices that you could maybe just use by themselves and the um the one i was going to mention here is that jasmine is the oil of sacred purity or sorry sexual purity and balance so if there's anything in your sexuality um or you know anything in your past that you've experienced this is a chakra that can close really easily because we protect ourselves um we don't want to be hurt in that area and it's so maybe you're not feeling very creative because you're you haven't dealt with that yet right so um make the roll on or get out one of these oils and and just rub it down there just below your navel and um we'll do another little bit of a a meditation on this one okay jasmine cinnamon or bergamot you could do by themselves um as i said the the jasmine is the the oil of sexual purity and balance and then the roll on of course we all know clary sage is so good for hormones and and women's issues and stuff like that right uh wild orange is um you know uplifting so all of these together so wonderful so let's close our our eyes and and and drop into our spine again and this time just sort of go into your your imagination when you go down into your creative center so your sacral chakra down down just just below your navel so imagine your spine and where that sacral chakra might be now these ones on your torso flow outward from the front of your body and they flow inward as well so we're putting energy out and we're taking life force energy in but it also flows from the back okay so you're you're letting energy flow outwards and you're letting energy flow inwards and so this one you could roll that on the back as well and so maybe if you are uh you have chronic pain in the lower back this might be something that you could work on so just imagine that orange energy it's a beautiful mix of red and yellow and and vibrant energy almost a color of fire even though it's the the function of uh water it is it is such a beautiful um sort of i guess it's it's the color it it when you see orange it sort of like sparks you right so just imagine that energy center flowing just imagine it opening up where we're opening up to be able to tap into the creativity that we know we are whatever it is whether it's a project or or something that you're you're creating just imagine that energy center flowing out and really when these centers flow outward it creates our aura right and our energy flows up and out all over so just imagine this beautiful orange energy just like the waves of the ocean almost just sort of in and out and spiraling and waking up opening up feeling the power of the water energy sometimes sort of breathe like you're you're in the ocean in and out and just imagine those waves just moving so lovely just flowing and when you're ready you can open your eyes and come back who likes to go to the water yeah i love it thank you so much oh you're so welcome you're so welcome the water is so healing whether it's a lake or a river pond the ocean fresh water salt water so um so lovely to go and just feel that energy okay so that is the sacral the next one is the solar plexus so this is the beautiful yellow color and this one represents fire and its function is empowerment so this one is right in the middle of our chest sort of just below the ribcage okay so this is really if this is open and flowing then you are feeling empowered you're you're feeling like you could conquer the world you could just do anything you could you know set something up and go somewhere or talk to someone or pick up the phone or do whatever it is that those tasks that you know need to be done and of course it flows from the outside as well at the back in and out sorry not outside but from the back it is the will that is sort of the representation that of the chakra in the back okay so the front is empowerment the back is the will so those two together if you've got the will that's what they say if you've got the will you've got the power right so it's sort of like that mindset of what i want to create this is going to do it this is going to give it to me right but again with this business with this past year are you feeling a little overwhelmed are you feeling like wow where do i go now and that's sort of where i was at i was sort of lost i was sort of like i need to get that back right and i did about the end of january um one thing that they say about this energy center is if you feel that you're sort of feeling less than or if you're not feeling like you're confident it's okay you don't have to feel empowered all the time but what i want you to think about is to pay attention to that and become aware of what is going on right and they say to keep your torso warm if you feel like and this makes so much sense if you're feeling less than you don't even feel like going out or doing anything right so let your body heal let your body work through it keep keep doing things that are good for you keep your posture upright and let yourself move through it become aware of what's going on and work on it make it so that you can put that behind you it's okay to feel it but just know that you don't have to be like that all the time and that's exactly what i was going through i i knew there was going to be something that that comes up for me this year and it did and and i just feel so empowered now i just feel like okay i got my groove back i'm ready to take it forward right and i know that many people have that throughout their lives it wasn't the first time that i felt that so lemon of course color of lemon the smell of lemon just imagine yourself in a lemon or grove you know where they actually grow and you can smell them on the trees lemongrass is really good vetiver bergamo and frankincense all of those together in the rollers you've got three lemon one lemongrass one vetiver and two bergamo and one frankincense and alternatives i put um coriander down here but blue tansy has got to be my favorite it's it's the oil of inspired action okay so what says that better than than um you know empowerment inspired action you have to be inspired you have to take action it's it's what we do right um tea tree is an interesting essential oil it will actually protect you from taking on the energy of other people okay so a lot of times you might go into you know a situation where you can just feel the tension in the air maybe it's a family situation or somebody's just had an argument you can tell without even being told right well if you put a little bit of tea tree right um in your center of your chest that will protect you okay and you know the mindset of using these oils comes back to the energy of your words and your thoughts when you're putting that on you're telling yourself this is what it's going to do for me and you if you do that with all your oils you actually find that they're even that much more effective and ginger is on here as well so so that's what the solar plexus chakra is all about the empowerment of the front and the will at the back so let's just close our eyes and drop into that part of our body down through our spine and there's there's major healing that goes on at this level but if you drop into an even more relaxed state deeper than meditation you can actually visualize your chakras healing so let's go back down through the spine down into the center of the chest just below the rib cage so you've got this beautiful yellow energy just like the sunshine just like that that beautiful life force of of the sun that that is what keeps us alive and it's this beautiful energy of fire that excites us that that keeps us moving that inspires us to take action and it's really this beautiful swirl of energy flowing out just imagine it balance and opening up and perfect attunement to that vision of where you want to go what you want to create just such a beautiful energy this this wonderful empowerment and imagine in your back you know this this idea of having the will having the belief in yourself having the the idea of where you want to go knowing it's it's so clear in your mind it's clear in your heart it feels like this is so right and i know that this is you know a lot of times what is missing for a lot of people is the belief and trust in themselves and the will to carry on and pick themselves back up and this is really the energy center that you want to work on if you're feeling that that you're just being held back a little bit because this is where it all happens this is the the the root the sacral and the solar plexus chakra these are really the physical ones that that move us forward right so so just open your eyes when you're ready to come back and uh yeah i'd love to hear your feedback if you're if you're seeing anything if you're feeling anything there's a question if tea tree isn't enough what else can you add oh more tea tree um that's a good question kathleen um it wasn't mine it's from the chat oh okay thank you appreciate you looking at that um protector blend probably would be good the on guard i would put that on my feet because that that's the essence of that that oil right the um the idea that it protects us not only from virus and bacteria i'm just gonna look it up but also from um you know what what is not right for us and that's the thing that that we can tune into what is right for us and what is not i wonder if on guard would be good that's what i'm talking about yeah the protective blend yeah yeah so it is the oil of protection that's what the book says and i mean it shields us from it from um harmful threats you know protective properties so definitely dr gina i totally agree that would be a good one to start with but if you don't feel like smelling like on guard when you go out if you're gonna be in the energy of people then or the presence of other people then put it on your feet and and um and then put your socks and shoes under your shoes right you don't have to worry about smelling like like clove or cinnamon but clove is the most powerful antioxidant there there is that's in the on guard um there's a scale that they actually measure anti the power of antioxidants and the oil is at the top of the scale it's like in the millions and everything else is in the hundreds of thousands so it's like above and beyond so you know how oils are 50 to 70 times more powerful than the dried but this oil tops tops the scale it's the oryx scales what they they call it cynthia i used to always try and eat blueberries because they're so high in antioxidants and now that i see clove i just do my drop of on guard gargle and swallow i mean i still enjoy it but i'm not drawn to it for its antioxidant properties anymore yeah awesome good for you yeah i think i think we just have to pay attention what what is right for us right we might take something for a while and find something else and try that and just go wherever your intuition takes you so this is the the next one this is the heart chakra so this is basically right in your the center of your chest and of course the function is love and this is the the element of air and um you know i think this year we've we've been um kind of sad we've we've been lonely um you know the elders have had to be by themselves um single people you know it's really hard to have a bubble that that you can um stick with we need to give ourselves more more love we we really do need to look after ourselves better you know i i say to to my clients that come that you know have no motivation to cook for themselves but when they have somebody come over they'll cook a six you know a six-course meal so why don't we do that for ourselves right why don't we take the time to make good meals we don't have to be fancy you can keep it simple but just make it good for you right um taking time out of a busy day to to be good to yourself whether it's have a bath or go for a walk or have a nap even you know like do things that are good for you it's not you don't have to nap all day just take a little bit of time and and open your your heart to yourself now i know there's you know lots of people we go through relationships we get hurt by families or you know like we start to sort of close our heart off because we don't want to be hurt okay and the subconscious mind sort of does that um just automatically because it actually its function is to look after us okay it's to protect us from being hurt again and that's why we sort of move away from people we don't want to get too close sometimes it's our subconscious mind that does that so if you're able to look after this in a way that is you know sort of ceremonious so getting out your oils and the one that i wanted to to note for this one is the rose okay get out your oils if you have rose that's wonderful if not um magnolia or ylang ylang or any of these lavender bergamo jasmine or clary sage rose is the highest vibration of any plant in the kingdom and what that means is that there's energy to everything so let's say the plant peppermint right it has a certain um it actually has an aura that that can be photographed plants um we have aura that can be photographed as well and so it's it's that that energy that is there that is measured right so rose has um it it's the oil of love basically it's the oil of um divine love and that's what we're sort of opening up to when we open our heart it's opening up to the love that not necessarily just for ourselves or just for someone else but it's the love of all things right so that includes the earth the stars the universe the you know the the people that do bad things as well right like it all comes as one we can't pick and choose what to love we we want to tap into the whole balance of it all right if there's if there's you know a lot of evil in the world there's a lot of compassion that comes up it it balances it out right like either way um and we have to sort of embrace it all i don't think that there could ever be a world where we're all good like it's it's an imaginary thing but what happens is when there's evil there's there's just so much good that comes to the surface and we've seen that over the years as well let's talk about getting into our heart center and breaking down the walls you know i've had several clients here they they make walls out of cement and barbed wire and and brick and it's it's when you go into that heart space and you see what's going on that you're able to break down those barriers so let's do that let's sink into our hearts right now let's see if there are any walls let's let's sort of see let's just sort of walk around our heart just drop into your heart close your eyes and imagine what your heart looks like this is the the beautiful green energy that is swirling around i want you to just sort of take control and just sort of imagine that energy opening up to go forward imagine that whatever that wall is made of around your house just imagine around your heart just imagine it sort of coming down maybe you have to take a sledgehammer to it maybe you have to you know dig it up and and move what's ever in the way but just let your heart expand let that green energy flow let that that beautiful beautiful green energy just envelop your whole body and just give yourself some love let it flow out into the world when you put your intention into doing something like that it is felt everywhere and especially when we're doing it all together it's it has an effect and just imagine your heart center flowing and balanced there's no walls anymore it's completely clear you're able to open up and trust again in one baby step at a time just imagine that beautiful green energy opening up and when you're ready come back to me you can open your eyes i'd love to hear anything any feedback on that one how are you guys doing okay i feel great thank you so much now i understand why i love the rose oil i use the rose oil on my heart especially when i work at the hospital i'm a nurse it makes me really calm i really love the rose oil yes yes the rose touch is a lovely product i'm so glad they have that yes it makes it so easy to use right yes yes such a pure pure oil and to think that came from all across uh i think his bulgaria that that rose comes from i have a question when we uh alternatives oil how many drops we should add well the alternative ones are basically just ones to use by your by themselves there's that recipe at the top and then alternatives are if you want to use them by yourself or if you want to replace one oh i understand okay thank you yeah i know i use my rose oil too and i just i just love it um what else was i going to say yeah the the rose petals that are picked for doterra apparently are picked in the morning and that is the best time um for the fragrance um that's what i was told anyways um and it just sort of makes me happy to think about that that that the women that that pick these rose petals up in the mountains they do it before their families are even out of bed so they're up early they go do their their um harvesting and i just love being outside in in my garden and stuff so i can just imagine them going out there and doing that and then they come home and they're able to look after their families you know like i just think it's wonderful that uh doterra is helping people you know in far away places do what they love to do the rose is there so this is the throat chakra beautiful blue energy this is all about communication expressing yourself um its function is sound and when i when i say that i think about the monks that chant um anyone who sings so very healing and because what you're doing is creating that vibration in your in your throat right and you're it's it's waking up your throat chakra and i like to imagine this one as a um column of blue light that that is just sort of encompasses your whole neck and just imagine it being like a crystal clear blue beautiful you know energetic light right it's um if you're feeling sometimes like people don't hear you or maybe you know there's all different kinds of communication styles right maybe you're feeling like people don't hear you or you're not using the the the words that you'd like to use to communicate you can't really express yourself then notice when this happens is it when you're speaking about something in particular is it um maybe to someone in particular um is there anything there that um that can show you where you do speak more clearly and and just sort of journal that out and that means just get a pen and paper and just say when i'm speaking to so and so i feel like so and so and when i'm talking about this i'm not able to express and you'll find that when you journal you're able to just let it all out you just sort of release it journaling is such a wonderful way to to um just sort of get what's on your mind out on on paper right i notice that i'm i'm talking a lot we're ten to nine already here but um two sandalwood one spearmint three lavender and two siberian fur in the recipe and um alternatives are arbor vitae peppermint and yelling yelling and ylang ylang is the inner child it's the oil of the inner child and i chose that one because i sometimes hear children talking and they are so truthful they don't have any preconceived ideas about what i'm thinking they don't have any they don't make assumptions they aren't expecting anything and i think that that's how we need to open up this throat chakra so just imagine for a moment just close your eyes and imagine this beautiful blue energy that is like flowing upwards and downwards and it's flowing outwards and it's clear and when you put your oil on you can put it on your throat and you can tell yourself i am speaking clearly i can speak clearly i express myself easily this is how i love to to talk this is how i love to to communicate whatever it is that is going to be the affirmation for you whatever makes sense for you then then um put that into it because it's called an anchor you're you're having the words and the ideas the thoughts go into a physical thing with the oils with uh your affirmation okay so that's the beautiful blue energy and this is actually um just come back to me when you're ready this was actually a lavender field that i painted it was with finger paints and it's a it's quite a big painting um i put on the blue gloves that are really close to my you know close to your hands like food uh prep gloves and i just painted it with my fingers it was such a magical thing my girlfriend talked me into doing it and i just love doing it so the painting is um you know sort of what i have become very clear on in how i'm moving forward and so i'll just go through these last two slides quickly and then we'll have um a bit of a q a if anybody has any uh any questions so the third eye is something that a lot of people are not quite clear on it is right between your eyebrows basically and this is um this is a tool that we have we have uh something called intuitive vision and this is this is what this represents is our ability to feel or know or we we might hear the words we might sense them we might feel them there's all different sort of a range of different ways that we know exactly what it is that we have to do but we don't always listen to our intuition do we this is the thing this one represents light okay so what i want you to think about when we're doing this is the light that you're shining in so that you can see out okay so this one is um related to the head headaches nightmares you're feeling dissatisfied you're not clear maybe you want to um meditate but you can't seem to settle down this is this is the tool to make the the connection with spirit or um you know maybe prayer um religion has nothing to do with it it's about your spiritual path and and what makes sense for you right so practice the art of opening the third eye to connect and this is really the channel that's going to take you to that connection okay so the recipe is one of jasmine three of rosemary which is really good for the brain of course three of clary sage and two of juniper berry a juniper berry is really good for nightmares i don't know if you knew that or not um helps to sort of take away that that fear and alternatives i suggested are frankincense neroli and copaiba so copaiba is the oil of unveiling so uncovering lifting the veil um you know opening the curtains lifting the fog allowing you to see what it is that you need to see now i know that um many people are feeling very um like there's a lot of things that are happening in a synchronistic way and what's happening is the energy is shifting on our world right now and um we're able to manifest quite a bit more quickly than we ever have before maybe you've experienced where you know you sort of think well at least this is what happened to me it's like oh i think i need a chair for i was doing massages and i wanted a chair that i could just sort of sit and do it and sure enough two days later a chair showed up for me um you know if you're thinking about i don't know doing something and then sure enough something shows up where you have the opportunity to do that this is the manifestation that i'm talking about this is the intuitive stuff that i'm talking about this is the the um the thoughts that you want to have the positive things of believing that okay that's what i need i'm going to put it out there and it's going to come to me right and then you wait for it you don't have to go out and spend a gazillion dollars finding it in fact you don't even have to find it it's coming to you and this is all about this it's the pineal gland that this is the whole system is related to the endocrine system but i couldn't get into that much detail with this presentation but it's really it's really um powerful when you have that feeling and you go with it and it's like yes i'm glad i listened to my gut right it's it's it's the gut it's instinct it's it's um it's it's so magical right so let's let's close our eyes for a minute and just go into that space between our eyes and just imagine that there's a an eye there and that it's it's actually opening up like maybe it's closed right now but the lid is actually opening right up and just allow that to sort of be your your your view that vision of looking outward into the ethers you know you don't see the the practical real world out there like you do with your analytical mind you see beyond you see beyond that okay and this is the the um the tool that you can use to connect to spirit gloated to the universe just you know connect with god whatever it is that you do in your spiritual practice this is this is sort of the the basis of it so um i love to put frankincense there when i'm doing hypnosis um and of course this is the the symbol if you want to come back and open your eyes this is the symbol of om and that represents all that is so back to being part of all that is and uh that's one of my paintings as well oh so how did you like that one good what color would you call that this is indigo indigo yeah so it's a really nice deep rich purpley blue and of course everybody looks at colors differently i think it could probably be a little bit more purpley but it's like i remember you mentioning once that um turning off your brain is this this chakra turning off your brain would be closing your eyes right as soon as you close your eyes you're you're turning off your brain to external stimulation right so we're at the the beta state when we're operating from the analytical mind the conscious mind um alpha is where you go to do light medic meditation it's where your brain waves slow a little bit down and then if you go into hypnosis it's theta okay so that's a natural state of mind just before you fall asleep it's where there's maybe lucid dreams you might be sort of part awake in the middle of the night and you might see things it's your imagination that's where you access your imagination and the the vision that you want to create and then of course delta is um when you're actually sleeping and there's different states of sleep as well you probably know that um so i think that's probably what i meant kathleen i'm not uh not quite sure but this is where you open up to your intuition so closing your eyes um you know can turn off your slow down your brain and then just you know like if you've got a query or quandary that you're you're working towards just sit with it with your eyes closed and focus on your third eye you know looking at it and viewing it and and you know imagining the fog lifting or opening the veil it's it's like just just let it happen you know and then if it doesn't show at that moment then just come out of that and let it be and it might come in your dream you can ask for things to come in your dream um and then just be patient and wait for the answers to come that's what i love i ask for for um you know visions in my dream all the time because that's where we're relaxed that's where it's going to come right especially if you have oils in your room at night then it's just going to help even that much more so for the third eye chakra where would you actually apply these oils right on there right on your third eye just right there yeah yeah thank you yeah and then this is the seventh one this is the last one um oh i think i have this wrong i shouldn't have intuitive vision here because that's what i had up there it is the this is the actual connection okay so this is the tool and this is sort of the point that i wanted to make this is the tool to connect and then this is the actual connection so this should say connection up here okay because this is really it it flows from the top of our head and it really flows up okay now our energy it's called a torrent and it actually is like this bubble of energy that we create it goes down and around we bring it in through our root chakra goes all around like this it's sort of like this circle with a donut hole right and um that's the pattern that our our energy flows in and especially if it's healthy energy and and flowing and open and so these these chakra centers contribute to that flow right so they take pictures of your chakra and sometimes there might be like a a tear in one of your chakras and they'll just be sort of like this this light that or this space that there's there's nothing there right like if your heart is is torn or you you know you're sad if you take a picture it's called curling photography and if you take a picture it will it will show where that is now some practice practitioners can feel it i am able to actually sense it and know it it's sort of like this knowing that i have and so i do online um healing sessions with people as well but um i don't want to get sidetracked here but i noticed that i i think i copied the page and then i forgot to change that so this is the connection this is how you connect with spirit connect with your your prayers with god um you know whatever your practice is so if you're feeling depressed if you're feeling bored if there's no focus try to allow the stillness of your mind and again just closing your eyes and sitting with it in a place that you don't want to be disturbed that you you're not going to be disturbed and just allow your mind to receive those messages and connect with spirit whether it is you know sending out your prayers and then feeling that energy being received and and you know just sort of sit with that and let that happen and it's exactly what it is is the um the communication to spirit okay so here we've got one of ginger two of ylang ylang two of roman chamomile and two of frankincense um and alternatives i would use would be rose sandalwood and geranium so this is the um this is the light this is the understanding right and this inter intuitive vision should should read connection so i apologize for that error um this is the connection that you make so this is the the top part of one of the yoga chakra energy girls that we paint and um you can see clearly the the energy flowing out of the top of her head and the the the sort of the vortex that is here has really this is the highest amount of um like they're all a bunch of spinning spiraling um vortexes flowing from the crown chakra so um just just take a moment and imagine that happening and just open that up just allow that to just sort of open up and i love to put oils on the top of my head spearmint's my favorite um you could probably try rose or sandalwood or even drain him if you like those smells um but these are really the visualizations are what you want to do right to imagine that energy center opening up so if if you're in the habit of meditation or prayer try this the next time before you actually start your prayer just imagine that connection being made okay and then do your prayer just see if there's any you know a little bit of difference there any questions about that one well i have to tell you this is my favorite chakra and my favorite oil to put on this chakra is adaptive oh really dale anne and i are and two other ladies are the chakra queens yes i know i love it yes yes it's just i have a lot of times too where i'll just dream it it's like you have to allow the possibility for things to happen exactly that's right i always say that everything is right here all these different possibilities and we just have to tune into it right and not let anything else get in the way like what we think other people are gonna think or what other people are gonna say or you know um i just do my own thing i don't even do research on something i'll just go and do it and so i just want to tell you what i do and then we'll have a big question and answer time and then i'll let you go because i know it's getting late for you guys this is my website that i got together this past year is shiftyourcore.com and what i'm starting to do is a paint class because i love watercolor and i have put together two different times on thursdays and for me it's going to be a way to connect with other people we're doing it live on zoom so we're doing it 10 o'clock in the morning my time pacific time or 4 o'clock in the afternoon and so it's anyone who wants to just just be creative you know maybe you've thought about doing watercolors before it's great for beginners because we start with really simple things i email you a template you you draw it and then we just fill in the colors and chat and we do a chakra meditation to start to help you sort of get grounded and it was just so fun last week i just had to put it all together so i did and we've got a few more people joining us this week so if you want to do that um just go to shift your core and then i've also got a chakra healing program coming up and this is more detailed it's it's really you know sort of diving deep into um actually looking after yourself and paying attention to these so it's probably going to be another two or three weeks it's just about there and then live from your soul is my sort of signature program we talk about awareness release creation belief and future visualization and this is the deep dive um sort of year-long program that i do and we can meet either once a month or twice a month throughout the whole year and i love doing that because then we really get to know each other we really get to sort of figure out where it is you want to go and what you want to create and there's my information there if you want to connect with me i'd love to to hear from you so so that's pretty much it and then we're uh we're done cindy this was so amazing i just want to say this is dr tina and um you know it's kathleen liu who said tina we need to learn about the chakras reach out to cynthia miller so i always do what kathleen tells me because it's always good stuff she i reached out to you and you said yes right away and i wasn't sure what was going to happen but yeah i was going to say that this was so healing for me oh that's so good i can't even believe um i i i'm almost i'm gonna cry but i just wanted to say thank you for your understanding your intuitive vision to come and communicate with us tonight with love to empower us creatively and to help us feel safe stable and secure oh thank you so much so beautiful i just want to grow up to be like you and i actually want to join your paint class oh can my kids come because we home school oh i don't see why not okay all right because you're gonna be there anyways right sure yeah i have one um my one who's uh turned 10 this year she loves to paint oh that's so cool thank you so much she's so welcome we'll just um yeah just go to the website and you'll see all the details there and um yeah if you want to sign up for that okay so we can see your website for that okay yeah okay and then we'll have you'll have the um materials that we need for that too yes yeah okay yeah all right thank you you know i do have a question um i loved how each chakra you pointed it to a a something in the earth that we could touch and feel and i'm wondering with the crown chakra um is there a physical like anchor like everything else like lights sound um what is air what i would say what i would say is the ethers the ethers yeah yeah and so that can mean a couple of things it can mean you know out in the universe the stars all that is the the vast expanse of existence that we know of you know we're just one little tiny spark in it all right or it could mean your subconscious your your inner self your your the part of you that you know we can communicate to right because i think that's what we're doing when we're when we're connecting we're we're in our powerful self we're doing what we're meant to do we're me we're you know we have that purpose a purpose doesn't mean i'm going to accomplish something or you know i'm meant to be a healthcare provider or whatever our purpose is to really be the best we can person inside from the heart right um that's what i think anyways and so it's it's about the subconscious mind that directs us to to do that right that's where our actions come from and it all comes from what we've been exposed to our childhood what we believe but we can change all that we can we can we can be better than my past right i can be better than than what i've experienced so the ethers the unknown it's not very physical but it's sort of mystical yes yes yeah so that's good i'm glad you guys enjoyed it it was lovely to meet some more people and see some smiling faces we have like 50 people on at one time wow that's wonderful does anyone have any questions this was such a rich class i just want to grow up to be like you cynthia so a lot of this you know your voice is so melodious and taking us on these journeys you know within our minds and within our bodies um the guided imagery is that what you call it you know it's so relaxing and so soothing and you know there's no expectations there's no rules that we have to follow it's all just being whoever we are

before and it was it was so lovely to share with you um you know this because i think that you you've got that interest in it and and it's just you you want to gobble it up because it just it just feels so right right feels so good right and i think that we do this and it is self-love when we explore ourselves and we understand ourselves better like it it's just the way to be right um yeah i

just a bit yeah i know i do and it's funny just you know talking about that i i had a hard time bringing the oils into my healing you know i didn't want to talk about oils to my healing people and i didn't want to talk about healing to my oils people but i finally sort of pulled it all together like it took me a while but i sort of have blocks myself about things you know and it's sort of like i worked on it and it it's coming together you know so it's the same with anyone else i think if there's something there that just doesn't feel right just doesn't fit just keep massaging it you know just keep working it right especially if you have another job that you're trying to work things in just stick with it it's it's such a beautiful thing to to have oils in in your life and you you know

thank you guy he did we had korean food we're still gonna we're gonna go eat his cake now and we had dessert now so you got korean food you said well we had korean beef and cabbage okay so you know kimchi and bogo beef instead of corned beef and cabbage that's right you could have corned beef the rest of the whole year right it was uh instead of corned beef it was korean beef and cabbage very creative i'm sure he liked it because i'm sure every year he gets corned beef it's one of our favorites i was hoping i was coming over for the for the meal and then it wasn't here it was no corn bee there was no usually every year there is tina's usually like giving me a plate here takes him home to david like give some to him i got a recipe for an instant pot i have to try yeah or corned beef yeah oh one cup of water 80 minutes somebody said 4 cups of water 70 minutes oh no that's too much water i just did one today elaine told me one cup of water and since it was a three pounder to do it for 80 minutes instead of what instead of 70. everybody says 70. and don't rinse it if you've got the the slimy stuff on the meat don't rinse it you're only supposed to rinse if the pack the seasoning packet is separate so you rinse and then you put the packet in and then add water oh my my seasoning packet looks like it's separate oh my mind was from smart and final and it was all gooey in there with the little so if it's all gooey in there you don't rinse it right no don't rinse it because the meat will be very bland okay but if it if it was separate meaning they probably did something with the meat already right and then it's just different styles but then i took the meat out and well i left the meat in and i cooked some potato and carrot and it only takes two minutes to do the vegetable and then after that it wasn't enough so i took it out and just with the juice that was left i cooked more potato and carrot and then i put the cabbage in there but i only had napa cabbage so it's pretty tender you could just kind of like wave it over the steam and it's cooked you know two minutes on instapot for the vegetables yep don't do it more than that you'll be sorry did you add water no i cooked them in the water from the meat oh i added it to the meat with the juice and then that's what elaine told me to do and it worked really well oh okay well i've never done it so whatever i do is better than nothing well i always did the crock pot all day you know today is my right low and slow crock pot right that's how pete did it too makes the house smell really nice precious was looking for dinner but she didn't get that it helps to cook faster so we all need to drink extra water because all that sodium is going to be blocking this yes yes yes okay my ankles are already thicker but today today is my mom's birthday she's been gone for 14 years now and every year of our lives we made her a cake with the most god-awful green frosting she loved seven-minute frosting so we learned how to make it for her but it was still kelly green just green green like your shirt dr mark it was pretty beautiful hell yeah hell yeah yeah how'd you get it green you just use food coloring just lousy food coloring yeah it was my first year jeremy didn't want me to make him his green eggs and wow but he didn't want corned beef he's getting older now he's getting uh and he's getting uh [Music] [Laughter] does that make him crave carnivore maybe he really wanted uh korean barbecue like he would like he was very insistent so what did you get how where did you go to go so we

"Xst4_zZa2CQ": "huh got a bigger package this actually is just a use radiator that I bought from eBay I just want to show you what you guys can expect on the use part I mean it is nothing new but just might as well share it with with you um like I said I work on bikes but um this is a built that I'm working right now my own as you can see the bikes right there and this is my little not shot but my little garage that I have all my tools but anyways I'm gonna do them sceeto just a quick unboxing and this way this one I actually got a really really good price I got it for $100 free shipping and everything and there's a note from the seller and that's what he was asking the haven't went something but I got it for a hundred even anyways that's the damn paper wrap more and more and get the radiator with bubble wrap that's the box he's gonna put it aside not bad it's good protection but anyways so as you can see this is the front of the radiator it's a used one so I mean I'm not expecting perfection and obviously for the price $100 you cannot go wrong it's not bad the taps are good you know to put the water hoses the connectors and the fans are still good both of them the inlets for the water not good has the water cap radiator caps on it this is the only issue that it has damp but it doesn't leak water so I'm not gonna worry too much about it and also I have the water the coolant reservoir I have it over there so I'm gonna install it and also what else that's about it I mean I was gonna buy a new one but you know what prices for new stuff are really really high especially on my end said I have a lot of money to spend but if you can always find a good deal on something used just by just make sure everything's checks out good and it works I've been having good luck with use parts from eBay so just read the description that's what I recommend and then if you have a question just in a message to the seller and then it feels nice and the good seller he will reply back but anyways this one yeah like I said hundred bucks 100 bucks on the books and then with the fans and everything she's not a chimney price because I seen some other ones on eBay for 300 350 280 160 and brand new I mean I think is 500 so yeah you got the money go ahead buy it but if you don't this is your best way to go so yeah this is the radiator and there's some other parts and I'll be seeing you soon on next videos and show you more updates on the art one so this is the radiator for the r-1 2015 and up fits the the r1s the r1m and that's about it so I'll be seeing you", "e4XlUNJSiZM": "all right this is my 2001 young har six bought it with a couple of leaks they're all fixed now but I'm going to show you how I fixed the one that was giving me the most problems he'll leak from the clutch cover fix that one it was leaking from the stator side too which is his side where to connect right here wasn't sure if it was the gasket so I replaced the gasket on that it was still leaking we RTV dump around the actual grommet on the top which you can see the orange on there still leaking so I decided that I was going to clean it off really well and then write it for about five minutes and see if I can get the leak to find out where I was coming from after I got the bike parked it noticed that it was leaking from the top of that grommet there's a little boot that sticks out the wires go into you could squeeze it you can see the will leak down and the reason I was having problems trying to find it was if I wrote it for more than you know a couple minutes it would eventually come out the top of the boot and leak down the side of the case and then just kind of flow backwards so what's given the appearance that was leaking from the case it's like the cover itself and not from the grommet so what I did was I had a little pic like this and some RTV I just have some clear here as an example get to the grommet take your pick poke the hole in the bottom about right here just big enough to get the end of the RTV nozzle inside of there North V nozzle working inside the hole and then once you have it in there you can make sure it's inside a hole you squeeze it so you want the R to be to actually push upward to the wires which you can see where there's some RTV kind of stick and outward it's dried and cured so it actually plugs the hole that you made and it fills up like the top of the ground itself and then you want let it cure for about 1224 hours which i depends on what kind of RTV you use and how long you put you know let's see it if it's warm or cold outside you know your your basic things when it comes to something curing once it's done curing you you know make sure it's all clean off that any excess oils off the bike then take it right around for a couple minutes and then bring back try to check it check mine that seemed to clear my oil leak on the side clearly and since there was no actual do it yourselves or videos actually related to this where I was leaking from I figured I'd make one just to kind of you know if someone else had the same problem they could figure out a cheap way to fix it instead and replace the entire stator because the grommet and everything else is all one solid piece from the stator upward onto the bike", "zdx9d8YVxfE": "[Music] just as christ accepted [Music] praise to god [Music]", "V5NxWY93Mbw": "it's um a quick video that's my bike no.9 mir-1 it's the sound of a bad can chain tensioner which is right there that's why people put aftermarket non automatic adjusting ones on [Music]", "7-8ZSKtgwOw": "hi everybody welcome back to beauty for the win today's video is all about neem oil when you use neem oil as a hair mask it helps to stimulate growth it helps with any type of dryness on your scalp these dry broken ends it'll really help to seal those and help smooth them out great for frizz i bought my neem oil on amazon now neem oil is dark brown it's sticky and a little bit thicker in consistency than most oils that you would use on your hair such as avocado oil or olive oil and i noticed that the smell is kind of you know not not the most pleasant so you have to bear with that now rub it between my hands and i just massage it into my hair as best as possible it has almost like a peanut smell to it but it also has like a really strong weird smell to it i don't know it's not really my favorite smell so depending on what you're using your neem oil for is how long how how many times a month that you're gonna do it so if you're doing this to stimulate hair growth you could honestly do this once a week i would recommend doing this treatment once a week if you're doing this just to condition your hair help split ends you could probably do this two times a month or you could do this once a month you can really massage it into my scalp when you are ready to wash your neem oil out you might want to wash it twice just to make sure that you get all of the thick oil out as well as the smell it'll help get rid of that smell now i'm just gonna finish doing my ends here make sure i got all of my hair and then what i am going to do or what you're going to do as well is just twist your hair okay and a bun or just clip it up in general doesn't matter you don't have to be fancy and you don't have to look fancy doing this get your little clip and just clip it on okay just like that so i will be leaving this on my hair for half an hour you can leave this on for half an hour to an hour that's the best way to do this you can also put a bag on your head to seal in the heat so that's really going to help stimulate the growth even more so up to you after the half hour to an hour you wash this out and you will notice that your hair is a lot smoother thank you guys so much for watching today i hope you enjoyed this video stay tuned i will be making more videos very soon", "6KIc_Ev6f3Y": "hi this is linda from the euler movement i teach people how to use essential oils from doterra and other natural health products so whenever i meet someone that's never heard of doterra or they don't really know what's different about doterra i usually start off by explaining to them what aromatic medicine is versus aromatherapy so with aromatic medicine this is very much science based and it's where you can use essential oils internally inside the body as well as in certain cases directly applied to the skin with aromatherapy that would be more something that came from the beauty industry and that would consist more of diffusing essential oils into the air for aromatic purposes or diluting them to then apply them to the skin or into your bath let's say so there are quite different ways to use essential oils and most people are not really familiar with the aromatic medicine way and in order to use essential oils for aromatic medicine you really need to find a brand that is more medicinal in quality so by that i mean that it says on the bottle that you can take the oils internally because that means the company has gone to the right levels of testing to make sure that there's no synthetics in them so therefore it is safe to use them in that way so doterra is one of the very few brands that actually does do that rigorous testing with third-party labs so that we can use the products for those aromatic purposes and the other great thing about that level of testing means that we're always going to get that consistent um purity and potency so we know the products are actually going to do what they're supposed to do instead of like from one batch to another often not working with other brands so when i first found out about doterra and what was different about them back in like 2014 i was really surprised that you could do all those other things with essential oils i had been using other brands of essential oils for a little while and i was quite used to diffusing and um you know using them for relaxation but no way did i have any idea that you could cook with them or drink them in your water or make up your own little vegetable capsules or clean the house with them or use them on pets or kids i didn't know any of that stuff even existed so it was very exciting for me to find out that there was all these new options out there but the one thing that really got my attention and was actually the reason i decided to start sharing and teaching people about these essentials was something called the immunity blend or otherwise known as the flume if you check it up online okay so doterra became very famous for this flume blend and the reason being was that it was so good at boosting the immune system when it was under attack um and so gentle and so safe and people just didn't know that you could use essential oils to uh fight off pathogens like that um it was never something on my radar that's for sure so when i found out that they were in some cases even more powerful than anything else that could possibly um find i was just so blown away by that so what exactly is this immunity blend or this flume blend that i'm talking about okay so the first one is well let's start with f for f in flume right so the very first one would be frankincense essential okay so frankincense is a very strong anti-inflammatory um but it's also a booster oil so when we put it with the other oils in the flume it helps them work better so that's why we put frankincense in outside of using it for the flume it's also one of the best essential oils for our skin because it helps protect ourselves and make them live longer and we definitely want to keep our skin cells as healthy and long-lasting as possible right so that's why it's a big player in the skin care industry now it's also very good to support with pain because of that anti-inflammatory effect so you will find people using it for head tension and other different aches and pains throughout the body as a good support for that so that's our frankincense the next one in the flume will go with the l for lemon okay so lemon was one of the very first oils i fell in love with when i when i got my doterra um little starter pack um because i used to cut up lemon and drink that in my water every morning before work and then i found out i could just do two drops of lemon essential oil instead and this was actually much more potent because it was way more lemons going into that one little bottle it was cheaper it was quicker and was actually alkaline because it came from the rind whereas the fruit goes into your mouth it's acid and then it turns alkaline so much gentle on the teeth and the tummy so for me lemon was like one of the main reasons i decided to go ahead and buy doterra essential oils and then i started using it on my skin and i had the most miraculous results with my adult acne on my skin as well so and now i use it actually to clean my house i use it all the time to clean my floors it's the only thing i use with warm water i use i wash my fruit and veg in it and i drink it in my water throughout the day as well because it's a gentle daily detox and very good for the cardiovascular system so lemon if we put it in the flume is going to help as well kill pathogens and cleanse the body and give an antioxidant support now let's go to the o in plume so the for the o we're going to talk about on guard essentials so on guard is doterra's proprietary immunity blend um it is actually made of five different oils so you have wild orange clove eucalyptus cinnamon and rosemary and these oils when they are combined together are a serious powerhouse against pathogens there's actually been um studies done just on this specific brand this specific blend um and that's why it's become so famous um it's probably even more famous in some ways than doterra itself doterra has made a range of all different products in the on guard uh with young guard oil so they have like hand soap mouthwash toothpaste surface cleanser laundry detergent um it throat drops it's just an amazing product okay and then let's finish off with the um the last o and the m okay so these i like to call these my green brothers um because they're the two green ones in the in the starter kit when i first got them and they kind of do very similar things except one is much milder so with the tea tree oil um that one is very like gentle you could actually put it on acne you can put it on a mouth ulcer you could brush your teeth with it you can put on foot fungus anything like that it's not going to sting it's very mild whereas oregano that is a burning oil and you do not want to use that undiluted it will burn and you also don't want to take that internally for more than 10 days because it's very strong so it's like the bigger stronger brother but they're both very effective at cleansing the body and and killing off nasties so those are the five oils in this very famous flume blend that really brightened up my horizons and showed me what was possible with plant medicine okay so now when i tell people about that they generally ask me so linda how do i buy those or how much does it cost well if you were to go onto my website and buy them at full retail price they would be well over 200 euro so i tell people do not do that do not buy essential oils from doterra at retail price nobody does that okay well none of my customers anyways because i care about them too much so you want to go ahead and get your own doterra account so that way you get the oils at the same price that i pay for them yes that's actually how the company sells the products so you can actually get all the same prices that i get as a business partner of doterra how amazing is that um so the very easy way to do that is you can either pay 25 euros to set up the account that's your fee for the year um or what everybody typically does instead is they just go with the starter kit now the starter kit gives you free membership it gives you all the oils in the um in the pack at a discounted price um and you also get uh your uh two free classes from the person you buy the kit from so be careful where you get the kit don't just go online and google doterra and then just sign up like that because i don't know who you'll end up with and certain teams are better for supporting and doing the training than other teams so um with with the euler movement you will always get two free classes you can get constant ongoing um private messaging or phone calls whenever you need them you get added to our community groups on facebook and so you can hear from all the other people that are using the product sharing experiences and asking each other what would you do um you'll get constant access to other advanced free trainings in skincare and how to use them with kids and how to green clean your house and how to use them for stress and the list goes on and on we really pride ourselves on the free training and the community aspect of doterra so you get let's cover that again you actually get the 10 most popular oils plus the ability to buy the oils at the same price as me plus you get um all that free training in community from the euler movement as well so that's why the kits are just a no-brainer okay so if you said right i definitely want to go with the kit option i don't want to pay the 25 euro as most people would where does that start so this kit is the beginner entry level price point is called the family essentials kit okay and it's 148 euro including taxes and delivery so it comes in this cute little box with all the 10 bottles i just took some of them out to to go through them with you and aside from those ones we just talked about in the flume you're also going to get breathe oil um which is also sometimes called air they've changed the name of them because the legislation purposes in europe but um that's a beautiful one for clearing the the the sinus um so just like one drop into your hand and then we make our own inhaler so we actually make a circle with one hand and then we cop the back and then we just take in oh lovely deep breath and that just opens up the airway and cleanses that respiratory system and supports you so you can either just do that sorry i keep doing it because it's so nice or you could actually put that into a diffuser and have that running near you in the room some people like to have it on in a diffuser that has like a 10 hour setting so that it comes on and off throughout the night and it supports them while they sleep because that tends to be where people struggle the most so very good for anyone struggling with respiratory issues or someone who just loves a clean fresh smell um to be feeling energized and awakened by um by breathing that in it's a really nice blend of like peppermint eucalyptus raven sarah it's one of the really popular ones okay next up we have lavender essential oil okay i'm sure anybody watching this has already heard about lavender but what you don't know about lavender is that you can actually take lavender internally it is sold in the chemist in france over the counter as an anxiety um product for in pill form okay so you can make up your own little veggie caps of lavender if you're suffering with anxiety or you can't sleep those would be the two reasons you would generally take it internally another thing you might not know is that lavender is amazing for the skin so um yesterday my husband burned his finger cooking something in the kitchen and straight away i got the lavender for him and he put it on and it just took the pain away and it didn't blister so very powerful for accidents in the kitchen also brilliant for bug bites or sunburn or um rashes any sort of infected skin it's going to be fantastic for that okay um and then oh peppermint so peppermint is like one of the most versatile essential oils because you can literally first of all most people just start off by taking not even a full drop like a third of a drop and just licking that and holding their tongue to the roof of their mouth and again it's clearing the respiratory system it's freshening my breath it's helping me digest my dinner it is helping giving me some energy probably shouldn't be taking it late at night um it's brilliant for brushing your teeth with it because it removes so much more plaque than regular toothpaste um and it's um very energizing in the morning okay so it's one i would brush my teeth with in the morning but at night i'd probably do more of an on guard or a lemon or something that's not as stimulating okay peppermint is also really good for baking if you like to use any kind of mint flavors like in energy balls or um in your morning protein smoothie or something like that okay now when you put lemon lavender and peppermint all together either in your hand a drop of each or in your diffuser or in one of those veggie capsules this is an amazing respiratory support during seasonal threats so if you suffer with these sort of springtime seasonal threats stuffy nose from all the dander outside then lemon lavender peppermint is going to become one of your best friends okay um so i i'm using that at the moment because i have pregnancy cyanide so i'm putting that in my diffuser when i go to sleep at night so that's the three combined and then the last two in the starter kit of these 10 most popular oils would be zen jest so this is our digestive blend so to use this you can um if you feel like uh you're bloated you've got cramps your diarrhea you're nauseous any of these things you can take like two to three drops and then just rub it clockwise in your stomach okay uh you can also put a couple of drops in your water or again put them in the veggie cap so this is a really popular one for digestive troubles and then the final one is another blue colored one is called deep blue so this is really everybody's favorite for pain support so if you've got arthritis or you've just got an injury or you just wake up with a crick in your neck um anything like that deep blue is absolutely so powerful for um the best way to use it would be like apply a little bit every couple of hours so we always want to just go with a little bit of oils but be consistent in the application so that's deep blue so that's generally how 90 of my customers they start off with a little kit like that they have everything in the house to actually develop an oiler lifestyle they get the training from me and then they start making up their own products as well and it becomes this whole cool thing that you now have at your fingertips a whole new tool set um and especially as a mom this is something that like will really be such a game changer in your house so i hope you found that interesting and if you want to know more information about the essential oils or the classes or how to buy them the best thing to do would probably be to look up my facebook page the euler movement and send me a message on there and i can send you um more information of how to buy the essential oils or how to attend one of our free classes that we have coming up over the next couple of weeks okay so i hope you enjoyed that and i hope to hear from you all soon bye for now", "8MhX41wD1uE": "my 2005 Yamaha r1 I just replaced the seal in the clutch rod um this little thingy here okay and prior to that I had a leak over here under my stator I took it apart replaced the gasket and after that leak stopped then the compression I'm sorry to be of pleasu started leaking like that like as you can see it was it's all over my rear swingarm but anyway okay so I just replaced the seal in the clutch rod and I took it out for Drive let it warm up to temp operating temperature and I went down the street came back and I said uh I'm gonna go one more time went down the street kind of got got into the high rpms and this is not leaking anymore for one but as I got into the as I raised my rpms up I felt something like hit my foot I don't know what it was I checked for everything I don't have my bottom faring on by the way because I mean obviously gives you the bike is like all down but excuse my language guys but um yeah anyway I looked over to by trying to see if I could find anything to flew off or there was some missing piece brackets or whatever etc and I stumbled across this point that it's where I see where the oil is coming out of now Facebook how many I'm starting out Facebook YouTube I don't know what the is going on here can somebody give me some answers", "4sCgLW2f72U": "so what I do with these things and put my stomach yeah and you got to put the anti-seize on the threads this way whoever's got to take these plugs out next time is going to love me because of the anti-seize don't want to get any of the electrodes okay put it back in and I'm ready to go go back home yeah it's dripping yeah branch nice and tight like two gorillas tight and you put your coil back on yeah press hard and you'll hear a click where I'm guys heard that click I'm not going to do it again they push it one more time hey guys hey let me fix it alright sorry that's it all four are done one two three and four all right Wow time to put this puppy back together and put the radiator up and eat All Right see in a bit you got any free / oil yep all right well I filled up the antifreeze right there I have one more fair and put on this sides on bolt it up the center part right there got the two bolts there and I'm bolt weird another bolt over there right there Oh thing i forgot about which i had to go to nap before plus 3n double-sided tape damn goes on tape ones for the ballast and leds yellow hair the other one right there so i figure now the paratime whatever maybe fix this maybe maybe there's my good stuff in here good stuff there it is this alright then throw this way met an old friend today haven't seen this person in a long time there's good talk no anyways

in the ass ah i also got some dot 3 brake fluid and napa all right well maybe i would like to see me put this new this other fairing on here so cool here we go ok you Jeff forgot to take off this sticky deep hoping on wash this bike today I'll have to take it for a little Rick to see how well I well she performs lunch I always keep pressure on it for a little bit yeah I going anywhere yeah well so I think didn't stick what I had our place this one to a disease Scott's a fairy well there's not same ol ball and chain good old song take the other side of the sticky thing off of 3m is really hard area yeah right again hold it there for a few seconds and break hi siren to the skin good click click click click click I guess some things to hold on zoo screens one this is tight cars yep tight quarters trying to get this top part in here listen those wires down get them out of the way cool there we go now it's fitting nicely lon clips these fans are such a pain in the ass as once you miss one clip you miss mall luckily I have no idea what I'm doing so I have no problem SI esta gran up this fitting right there come on why is it not catching my hand up up there it goes I'm going to put it up here now come on there goes cut more on the bottom all right there two on the bottom click and click I'm missing ones this video one right on the bottle i'm missing I can't see any on the ground now there's some clips let go in let me show you the few appear you", "Jja3OjQTfHg": "our guys as you can see bikes back indoors it was on road for like three weeks at max maybe four rides and they set to come back in as you know I think I've burnt out my clutch we're not going to know until we open it up and see I've looked at the adjustments of the cables they seem fine so it's definitely something inside as you know I have opened this up before to do the clutch rod seal the platter would seal I've got a video on that you can check that out and so I know what it takes to take this off and how difficult it is to put it back on it's quite fiddly so I'm going to go ahead and do that but before we do that we're going to obviously drain out the oil myself I think that dudes gotta loosen off the clutch cable it's got these twelve little nuts go ahead and just loosen them up once you got loose enough you can just take it off the hanger and then we've got this little retaining clip here just wedge that open and remove the cable all right so okay so the next thing we're going to do is remove all these em size 5 allen bolts I'm going to do them in a crisscross pattern so now we're going to go ahead and remove the clutch cover so what you want to do is try and turn this while you're pulling away nice and gentle there you have it guys as you can see I've got quite a lot of debris in there which I presume is burnt clutch material will try cleaned up before put this back on obviously as I'm loosening these obviously you could feel the spring pushing out [Music] but I've got all the spring bolts off and blind them up down there and as you can see I've got some trees what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna try to do this real time I'm going to take this off and start pulling off the clutch plates one by one I'm putting them putting them on top of each other in order for my own reference and for your reference leave that aside tomorrow I'm gonna have our first clutch plate and this is one I can clearly see it's it is completely worn just like a brake pad deciding to buy it but this bit clearly one I don't expect all the place to be like this there you go that's the first one for this time the metal that's also clearly glazed put that down next one it's one another as much as the first one as you can see these obviously a lot of brake pads they do wear [Laughter] [Music] [Music] little metal ring someone have to use this I don't have a something I've got another ring so that's it go ahead and get the other plates not hopefully what I'm gonna do is obviously give us a good clean get rid of any clutch residue or whatnot look at it for load up this is really doing he's going to need a nice clean I don't see any wear or any grazing with a t4 hold gonna go ahead and give us a good clean examinee and hopefully go and get the plates out and replace them that's also where you got use them you've got these little washers in there make sure you don't lose these Springs sit on those guard and give everything a nice clean obviously inspect this bit this is a bit that also can get really warm um if it's really whoops you might need to replace this one seems to be okay it is worn up until it's just exactly like a brake disc the feeling and those are like brake pads it's exactly the same feeling so yeah also mark gasket it seems okay this is a new gasket put on like maybe 2,000 miles ago so I didn't bother getting another one obviously if it goes wrong I can I can change it as the benefit of doing things yourself also the springs I've not got a new set of Springs again these these have only had like well five thousand miles on them so I don't bother to get new Springs because obviously when you get new Springs you're going to have to wear them in gonna be really tough on your clutch clutch and oh gosh so hers is my old plate and what brooms I'll set them up with these trees and is the bad duck my as you can see the oil is leaking up good and get my new clutch clutch plates out I'll get soaking in this bag here move this along I've gone I don't fill that with oil in the overnight obviously I need to put the metal clutch plates in there but I did anyway they're going to get all of the anyway so I'll put them all in there whoops and undercut blades it's time to get them out nicely socked in do oh okay obviously that's the same grade of water that I'm gonna be using okay oh so I'm gonna go ahead and get that metal ring get it soaked in some oil all right and like I said again there's a slight groove don't see its groove this way screwed like that a slightly groove okay so now I'm gonna have to go find obviously this was last out so first in um I can't till okay I think you could tell cut like that so got a garden trying to find that find that small piece this is what the new ones look like fresh place these are supposed to have Kevlar and whatnot inside them supposed to be race spec super strong so they say all right so they all look the same for now this looks as so it's the same okay here we go look that's a small one put that side let's see if we've got any other small ones and we got one two three four five six seven a nine so you got nine friction plates and these look all the same and there's one tiny one alright so now we're set up and all the metal ones The Clash place they look exactly the same so don't thing we didn't do anything with that guys so gonna go ahead and start loading up the plates and then slide them in turn the grooves what so long one metal each I can't see any any difference to be honest with you in in the way they go in so gotta go just slap them in [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Applause] so do you have it all I wanna do is just double check that on the other pile I've got right at the end it's also a fiver and we have a good look at that again so this is the bottom of the pile and look at that look at this side of it it is completely worn so even if that is like a meal a meal is enough for it to start slipping so hopefully that's done the job gonna go ahead and start putting it all back together now I'm gonna go ahead and replace the cover remove this piece as well wait for there and once you've got that flush make sure you still got all the washes in we're going to go ahead and replace the springs drink all the washes on the try and hand tighten these down now just press them in and hand tighten them down by so go ahead and then tight hand tight and easy Springs if I hit the top branch out so I've got these hand tighten and I'm going to go ahead and use a torque wrench like I said I'm doing nine point eight Newton meters on this but you make sure that you check your service manual and obviously you'll hear that click once is tightened guys so we've got the fiddly bit now so the idea is you're going to line up these teeth here you want to go in here and bite into those teeth and whilst you're pressing down you want to you you want to turn this bit so as you can see I hope you can see there's an arrow there and there's a dot here so what you want to do is as you're pushing in once you've managed to get this into that hole and you've got the teeth bite in once you're pushing in and as you're trying to get it flush the end you want once you've got it flush you want this and that arrow that door and the arrow to be lined up while it's flush okay so that means you've got it then this is going to take a few attempts it's going to be niggly but this is the difficult bit go ahead and take your time try again make sure the dowels I play what not I think I've got it I think I've got it shot myself as you can see hopefully you can see once I've pushed it the arrow lines up with the dot and do you have it go ahead and put the bolts back in to keep it there for now so sold on going to go ahead and talk this down to 10 NM again we're gonna go on a crisscross pattern obviously once you hear that click I know you've done it okay so put the cover back on go it all talk down so time to replace the clutch cable so go ahead and feed that through shut that little metal tab and go ahead and place that back there and now to go ahead and tighten the cable down so we're going to adjust this get the right FreePlay up in the handle as well and go ahead and replace your or fill our replace your new oil and it's all done hopefully once I've got it all done we're going to test it out now guys so got the bike out it's all done just in case you're wondering I used the Sur flex clutch kit a lot of people say the stock is is really good vice really expensive it's almost 200 quid I've got the operated version the sir flex clutch clutch kit for around hundred and thirty quid and it's supposed to be a lot but I supposed to be a higher heat resistance it's made of Kevlar and whatnot and it's supposed to be the upgrade version it's supposed to be really good so let's see what how it goes so this is the moment of truth I've no even started it yet I don't even know if it's going to start so let's do this it's a little off see what we'll go ahead some more oh that sounds shaky cliff Enoch [Music] clutch FreePlay seems okay I might loosen it up a bit more it's Tyler that's too much a little bit more time off that's about that should be alright something was rattling when I started it oh I'm going to take a trot quickly take it around the block see if it's still slipping [Applause] well clutches by knock until Oh clutches bitin definitely why it's just stalling wow that is a strong boy choose you just second quite nicely I just feeling good [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah clutch is feeling strong under Lila just that starting issue might be just might need a good little rug pulling nice and it's a got a real good feel to that clutch now [Music] yeah I was feeling good well spin around take a back changing gears okay sounding good [Music] [Music] [Music] after that little break it seems to be staying on but I want to try to start it up I just parked you up it's pulling nice clutch feels fantastic is is biting strong gear changes are strong and nice and smooth it was just that starting thing initially but I just took you around the block gave a little throttle let's see if it starts all right now so let's see if we can hear any noises from the clutches all that sounds sweet I'll handle it laughs can't hear any rattling [Music] so there you have it guys off we were back on roads", "bFJqTNlRNXE": "[Music] hey everybody your good buddy 650ib welcome to season four of the new bike build series we're taking a 20-18 Yamaha r1m and we're gonna install some amazing parts onto the motorcycle mainly supplied by our good friends Manny at moto million at the end of the build series we are giving this bike away to someone that is viewing these videos information on how you might win this bike like four other people have already done is in the description and today's episode Zach's here how's it going hey man thanks for coming back and watching we got some of our first modifications going on we got rid of the license plate changed our tail light to a integrated one oh yeah it really does it it really changed the way to back the bike look don't you think I do I do I told him I move on the next step miles I got five hundred twenty-three miles showing on the odometer there Wow thanks to Zach so we're ready to do the break-in service which is pretty much just an oil change okay and again just check lists where before we had something that we needed to print out and work through in here so it says 600 miles so we're gonna do the 600-mile checks which is check your clutch check your brakes rear brakes make sure there's no play in the steering head bearings side stand switch and engine oil sweet will check the tire pressure chain okay and that's it we're good we're broken in didn't really hit the redline too much just kind of very throttle and ready to do some major modifications now that'll be awesome on the dyno and see what it does stop okay cool sweet well let's get going let's see what we got to do to change we'll start with that okay always want to just have the oil warm it doesn't have to be hot like should set off it did yep and we're going to leave it in here keep the punch in you care clutch which is good they're just describing a little right so that's pretty good we know all our safety switches on an order all the lights work six millimeter break it free [Music] don't want to touch the exhaust pipes you can get it drained still looks nice has a good brown color to it it's not super black or anything until it hasn't been overheated no big chunks of metal that's always good that's draining so at a minimum we have to pull this bottom piece off but I think it'll be easier to do alright so it looks like if we removed the panel over the exhaust and just the two quick-release fasteners we'll have enough room to free our oil filter uses the same filter wrench as a hundred plenty of room just slip it up nice so now we just leave that drain for a couple minutes Jahna Lube of course I always like using the oil that the manufacturers provide yeah for the most part because they spent a lot of money researching what should be used in their engine so make sense least while it's under warranty if you're not looking for every performance edge I would just stick with what's recommended good call if synthetic isn't recommended don't need to switch until later on if it is go make sure you do use it is recommended for this boycott for sure so also on straining we can use money quick inspections we're just gonna make sure brake pads still look good which they should unless a caliper was hanging up or something they look just like brand new like we expect make sure nothing Crazy's lodged in the radiator take a look at the back there 88 or no signs of leaks of any kinds of fluid from valve cover gasket or anything water pump no signs of fluid leaks from the water pump it's back here I check our brake fluid levels they're still good rear brake pads look good make sure I didn't keep my foot on the rear brake the whole time I was riding it change is probably pretty loose haven't done anything with that yeah definitely need to tighten that up a little bit take a look at the shock right at the base is where I want to look make sure it's not leaking it's not same thing with the forks take a look make sure that there's no signs of oil leaking here okay it's not we can check our clutch replay that's good yes pretty much just have to come back and adjust the chain we'll clean it and lube it to and they don't pretty much be it for the first service the big thing is get enough break-in oil out sure yeah looks good not shiny or anything comes sealed that's pretty cool Dustin anything looks like it already has a grease on it if it doesn't you would want to use a used engine oil on that face okay take a rag and just wipe where this is gonna seat on the engine two reasons for that one it cleans off oil so it's not gonna drip after the oil change and two it makes sure that this o-ring isn't still stuck to the engine you don't want to have two o-rings there this is a case where two is not better than okay you'll have a massive oil leak and you'll lose oil pressure and you could actually blow up the engine so definitely don't want to have two o-rings behind an oil filter ever spin it on hand tight and then it's always hand tighten three-quarters of a turn we got some writing there so we can use that as a reference point this is probably even from writing it it's cool enough to touch already okay titanium is amazing in that favor facet it cools off very fast if this was a stainless steel header I would have just burnt back on I think who got all the residual oil off this piece just gonna slide back up into this pan there's two little tabs it doesn't look like a normal screw hot it can be called the Zeus type fastener and what it is it just goes in and there's a metal receiver piece on the other side as long as you catch it it just clicks was a quarter turn then you know you're back in there light all right so we got our new crush washer installed and see we're down to just a nice little drip so we'll start our drain plug back in thread it up in there by hand and then go to your owner's manual it has the torque spec for the oil filter and the oil during fog and you see all the oil that stuck to the bottom there so you know we do here not when you're done otherwise it just might leave like a grip or two when you park it in the garage yeah yeah so we're trying to clean that all off so it doesn't take some paint and I've marked the drain plug that way I know that I tightened it there in case someone comes in asking me a question sure pulls me away I don't have to get my torque wrench out again and be the founder to tightener almost I can just look real quickly that's not nice dispose of our oil filter and olive oil my recycling bin yep again just give it a double check and you pour out no large pieces of metal are any large pieces of debris that's how you're looking for yeah and there's not so that's good is it really bad if you overfill the oil yeah overfilling is almost as bad as it's hard to tell how much you've overfilled you know yes so you can see we're up in the site class now we're about in the center I'm gonna add just a touch more so are a little higher because again as the engine gets warmer and if you were to check it at operating temperature that probably be all the way okay let's run and double-check our clog-free play with ruler they have you check it out at the end and it's supposed to move 10 millimeters 10 to 15 we're right there it's right at about 10 and the last fluid we gotta check into fool at level of news [Applause] let's just leave it on until it stops mo confronts everything off okay [Applause] move on that we move in a duster change never off that sweep [Music] [Applause] so now we just gotta adjust a chain tension I got that axle not broken free Yamaha is a little bit of a tricky bike to get up on a rear stand because you have to really watch out there's ABS sensor right here and it's a plastic piece here they're set up for a different type of rear stand that uses pins yeah I'm sure a pitbull has an adaptive he might have to look into getting matter that's the same for the front too those sensors are in the front and I have to use the nipple thing at the front of it to do it yeah we were pretty loose mm-hmm I remember when I went to the Yamaha champions riding school they said they like these things kind of loose they like I'm loser will stick to the 25 side then which 35 side yeah a little bit tight just a little I do one more half on each side guilt that puts us sitting right at 35 man and that will just double check with our caliber though spacing on each side if you want the chain to be as straight as possible the rear wheel the track is J as possible see this looks pretty easy so far 26.9 on this side [Music] 26.7 so this one's got to come back are there hop back up on the rear sit down they just clean it clean it and move it I can't leave with Molly in it it seems to do a good job it doesn't fly everywhere I like that too I'd use it as well the center of the chain at the outside of the chain so it doesn't rust you don't wanna put way too much on but it don't give you put a little bit too much on just let it dry and then wipe it off and here it sounds nice and quiet now yes rotates nice and freely let's wrap it up you're standing do the final checkout right up to the top line perfect you can see the space up top there yep the engines really hot I ran until a fan came on so that is perfect all right take it for a quick test drive make sure that change just a couple other checks would be drawn free play and that's how far this straddle twists this bike does still run cables even though it's drive by wire the cables go to a sensor so the cables can stretch and then you need to adjust them okay there's too much free play it makes for a really jerky ride yeah this is actually perfect that's about exactly what you want so we don't have to mess with it okay pop 36 psi on both tires works well for the street yeah for the street you could go a little higher in the rear if you're riding with a passenger floor right on 30 suits perfect so cool stay tuned thanks for watching Thank You Zach and all right catch you next time so zach is about to take this bike for his little test right there make sure everything is okay and then when he returns we will start doing some really cool stuff for the bikes all right so somebody's gonna

I'm gonna put it right back in I'm not rebuilding it I'm you know it was working fine and there's no reason that shouldn't just slap right back in with the oil water pump chain in the chain guide the starter gear up here we're good to go I've already learned that the best way to do this is pull that starter motor out so that this gear is free spinning because first step is to insert this clutch housing and when this clutch housing inserts there's gonna be about three or four things that all have to align correctly the splines on this big gear have to align to the splines in the crankshaft gear the splines on this smaller gear behind have to align with the splines on that starter gear right there and then the notches down here have to be lined up with the tabs right in here so in order to get all these things aligned it helps if you can spin this around and then you have to spin the clout the clutch housing to get it to a line here and then you should be able to have the bigger gear align just fine in that so let's see we've got one roller bearing that needs to go on then we slide the clutch housing on I'm looking at the tabs down here to get a sense of where they are and then we'll throw this on kind of one hander it's best we can and the first thing is it'll it'll align to the crankshaft gear first then if you spin this gear up here it'll slide it in one more notch once it aligns with that gear and then last it'll either be aligned to the tab or not if it is it'll slide and far enough where these surfaces here are all flush with each other which they are not right now so that means I need to back this out a little and look to see if I can find by looking back behind and flashing a light down there where that tab alignment is anyway you play around with it you you know go back and forth spin your gear up here as you need to with your finger and through some trial and error you'll you'll get it in there okay there it is I only took me about five seconds after I turn the camera off with both hands to get this in and again notice these two surfaces right here are flush with one another now I know it's seated all the way back there okay thrust washers in next up is the clutch boss with all the clutch and rich plates removed just take it slide it right in it has to go over those splines so yeah it takes a bit to get this thing wiggled in but wiggle it all the way down which will take both hands okay both hands just kind of thumbs on either side back and forth back and forth slots it all the way down okay now you can go up through and install all the plates back in the original order and it suggests that you hit these with oil I'm gonna try not to make a giant mess here this process yeah there's no orientation let's just get the tabs into the slots which I'll do the rest of the way okay next Dan is this lock washer and there's just enough splines left to get this lock washer on that sitting flush all right clutch boss not notice it has a recess on one side and then the nut itself is flat on the other side I think the flat part is the part that faces outward that way the threads that are up here in the front rather than the back [Music] to loosen and what I need to do is make sure that when this thing tightens that depth that these little tabs one of them anyway is on a flat spot so I might loosen this adjust this a tiny bit tighten it anyway get it to where I try to get as much of the meet of that flat part on one of these sides and then I'll just use it a little punch or something to bend that thing over or flatten it down okay clutch boss nut is tightened up and in order to bend that tab over I'm just gonna use a big pair of plumbers pliers grab it grab the meat of that little flange bend it right over okay clutch boston nut torque down and lock washer tab fold it over now you take your pressure plate you put your paw rod behind it tapping all this dangle like that that's fine the seat has to be on the outside edge is spring plate seat then your spring plate and that should sit to where it doesn't interfere with any of these bolts and then you take your spring plate retainer and you go ahead and bolt that in and I think it's like five point eight pounds of torque something like that so far so good but this is the easy part hard part's coming up there okay all right see how I can manipulate this pull rod with a little magnetic pickup tool that fits right through this oil filler cap this is the best I think this is the best way to hold that pull rod where you want it as you slide this cover on that pulley has to be pointed back towards me same direction as these jaws on this pull rod cover plate there's not a lot of reading here pretty tight fit and where you need it then you need to be able to pull this magnetic tool off and get itself wedged a little bit and see if you can spin your pulley here and pick up any little misalignment there and the copper plate has to be seated all the way down but it's pulling to go all the way it's not seated all the way down you need this pulley to pull around you come down here there's a triangle mark and there's your dimple on your pulley those two things should align when this pulley is pushed all the way over so now I know my pull rod is is engaged just like that all right I had the gasket already in there with on the dowels sitting on the crank case side so now all I have to do is insert the bolts there are several some are longer than others to three it look like or shorter for for them are short and three of them are longer I'm gonna go through and check the manual to see where the long ones go there's also one that has a little cable clip on it so again I'll double check that make sure I know where that goes anyway magnetic tool that's the way to go to get your clutch engaged", "fP3LgcAGUYc": "okay so what we're looking at here is the oil pump chain and one thing I've noticed is there's a little bit of play in the sprocket mostly because where it connects to the water pump here it's just a slot and in a groove so it kind of which I'm assuming is normal but I'm not sure you know anything loose on a motorcycle just never seems right and then there's a little bit of play in the chain as you can see from up here on each side and it's not enough to pull the anything off the teeth like I don't think it's enough to jump a tooth if you pull the chain down it's pretty tight on the sprocket there is that looseness up top and on the other side as you can see so just wondering if that's normal what you guys think let me know", "gWNeVBYMc6Q": "I'm Brian Vance and sportbiketrackgear.com and we are here today with a good friend of mine Joe Kraft from witchcraft Motorsports are you doing Joe by yourself I'm alright man I am alright anyone who's been to our website and looked at our representation of all in suspension can clearly see we're doing it different than the other people Owens suspension is one of those things it's not really completely plug and play no not at all is some installation requiring some adjustment some setup factors just to get the maximum out of your bike so and we all ride different yes correct we got customers that would be maybe expert racer yeah we've got customers that have I'm going to write on the street but I want a lot better suspension than what I've got unlike more tuned ability more adjustability and then of course we're all different shapes and sizes what we do is we collect the information at time of purchase we then filter it on to Joe who then uses his knowledge and experience to make sure that we're getting all of the right spring rates and everything so that the components come ready for you to put on your motorcycle and it begins with a nice baseline from there if you need further advice you're able to reach out to us we get you in touch with Joe we can even help you fine-tune that stuff via email via the telephone whatever it takes I'm always available for questions like that we try and get people a good baseline set up a starting point and with further communication we can refine your needs and get the bike to do what you need and that is the difference and we think for our customers that makes a lot more sense we want to make sure that your experience with the product is everything that it should be and the reality is you need to be a little more than just a retailer to do that I understand suspension but I don't understand it like he does nor am I going to pretend to so when I do my stuff I just get showing he takes care of it for me and then I ride it and everything is good so let's talk about what we're going to do today well we're going to look at installing the 30 millimeter ni X cartridge kit on the Iowan Forks we've got separate compression and rebound cartridges ago in the right in the left fork leg and we've got the left leg here to do with the compression cartridge we want to say thank you to the Holland's USA for partnering up with us on stated a lot easier for us to get the suspension components for the bike that was the stuff that we're going to put on the bike no matter what I mean because you tell me that I know it's the best I mean that's just the way it is in our opinion it's the best that's the stuff that I prefer and regardless Oprah no belt that's what was going on the motorcycle but we do really want to say thanks to Owens for participating in this project real quickly cartridge kick shell yes rate the difficulty we got a scale 1 to 10 10 Zn don't even try and do it yourself one being I'm putting on a fender eliminator kit well for one thing it depends on the bike coincidentally on the r-1 forks it's pretty simple some special tools to get the old cartridge out get the new cartridge in check the oil height adjust it to the recommended olan settings and you're probably good to go the only problem you might have is sometimes it doesn't quite disassemble as we hope where the cartridge comes out as a unit and you may need some further special tools just to address those issues but rough cost on said special tools if you get stuck um I think that one tool that pulls the cartridge body outs like a hundred and seventy five hundred eighty bucks or something like that so just that one a couple of the tubes that that you use to get the cartridge out or 110 something like that so you're looking at maybe four or five hundred bucks total when you're all done just to have everything you need so you don't have to MacGyver some things and make it up as you go you know and remember we do offer installation service through Joe right the stuff comes to us Joe's really local to us he comes over picks it up services it brings it back to us we get it packaged up and get it out to you so if you want a cartridge kit but you don't want to attempt it yourself don't worry about it the installation charge is actually very fair in my opinion very fair just send it in we'll get you taken care of so as per \u00f6hlins instructions the first thing you do is unscrew the four cap and you get access to the spring preload tube and the rest of the cap and then we got to move over to our other voice over here and get up spring compressor on and this is as close as I'm going to get my own core cartridge kidding right now I'm actually just going to be holding forth in the fork spring compressor sorry I was working at something else last night didn't quite leave this up this is one of the really handy tools the fork spoon compressor just to get the thing apart otherwise you're struggling with this and you call a couple buddies over and can get ugly doing that for spring compressor is actually a real common unit that's a race tech unit we have that on the site and that is a real popular tool from the factory most of the bikes especially if you're a little heavier they're sprung pretty light and it's a very common that you're going to need to spring up and there's a lot of guys that are installing their own fork springs very common first we get the cap off the you gotta just a tube - we got a dump the oil out and catch some parts as it all goes out watch spring washers pump the cartridge a little bit to get all the oil out of this and we're lucky with this one that this is a new bike because that makes it a lot a lot easier to work with the oils nice and clean everything inside is clean we don't have to worry about the dirt and grime that usually accumulates in the bottom of the fork and all the oil that's in there which can be pretty epic when somebody lets it go in for a few seasons yes Audrey about that Dover's whiskers their search wasn't interesting nice interesting to say the least one of the \u00f6hlins tools to get the stack cartridge out so how's this one coming apart this one is very easy if you got the whole thing here and we do nice that's nice because you mentioned sometimes that cap can come off the top right of this the hard part is when these two separate in the fork tube and this is left down in the bottom that's when you got to unscrew the fork tube out of the bottom of the fork and grab that with another tool leaving which another costly item to have in the shop so probably a little heat - I'm guessing a little heat helps yes just to loosen up the lot type it's on but hmm check on the inside of this obviously it's new and nice and clean down there I think it will will rinse it out a little bit dog you definitely don't want any debris in there what's your honor and we want it the the owens cartridge when it goes in with a little lockpick that have a nice clean set of threads the blade on - looks good might even a little air we got the ones 30ml cottage kit out ready to go install we're going to remove the four cap preload spacer and then we have to disassemble the package - from the seal head because we install the catch is you tube separately be careful with those our magical piston and all its little shims now back over here we need to put a little lock tight on this they definitely not want that coming looks yeah this we need to stay in there and I also like to carefully put this down into the fork tube just try and slide this down in there so we don't drop it in and bang up the threads on the bottom and then another little odd tool you need is a big 17 millimeter and on the socket that's gonna go right down inside there thread that into the bottom of the fork to torque that in things don't go as planned pop them out a little bit it's no fun when things go as planned yeah let's keep it interesting right exactly all right so we got the fork tube tightened into the bottom of the fork and then we put in roughly half a liter of ohlins 1309 fork fluid then we will install the cartridge this we apply some red grease onto the threads of the carriage tube because we want this torque in but we don't want this so that it's not removable for any future tuning you may want to change the shims on the piston there carefully put this in and we're gonna torque that is our special alms tool are all 30 milk it's set up like that words rebound one side compression the other side or is that just because that is the way the fork was designed on this r1 no they're all that way the NI X 30 milk it's from all into all this like that the older 25ml Kip's had both compression and rebound in each fork leg the 30ml kits are rebound in the right leg and compression in the left torque that in there you know just off the top that could be a major turning advantage from say like top teams or actually so they want to make a change to the compression stack you only got to pull one side apart that's correct that's correct than that I would imagine that's part of the reason why they engineered it like that our next step is to bleed that piston we loosely attach the four cap cube up to it and tighten that by hand we just want to stroke this up and down a few times 10 or 15 times just to get the air out of the piste out of the cylinder and usually they bleed pretty easy because you put the fluid in there first and the piston goes in on top of it it's usually not an issue and it isn't this time either you can tell if this doesn't bleed that it'll jump up and down there like there's froggy right you know resistance yeah but this one's good after you get it bled we need to set the oil hight a lot of variation in the oil hike depending on the tuner you work with the bike here working on and the application we have but we will use the stock ones recommended height which was 140 millimeters so you get your whole turkey baster out and you set the height at 140 mo meters and good to go and that's a pretty common tool there that's a motion arrow motion yeah for coil height gauge now the real money for the tools is going to be in all the specific \u00f6hlins tools and then you look at things like what Joe has on the floor here is there an old vise put soft jaws in it fastened it - and old autumn over the ramp but I mean you need to be able to do that yeah it needs to be heavy on the floor right it's gonna be stable so that nothing falls over it it gives you a good work platform going to start with after that we need to put in the fork preload tube spring support and the spring we're running one old Springs and this installation a good rate for racing yes tire it Brian's wait do we have to talk about that roller I mean I know I've put on a couple of pounds no that's a good middle-of-the-road great that's there's no that's the same rate that I run on my 600 - I had good success with the 1.0 is on the 600 front and rear so there's another reason we went with this Jose when I put those on for me obviously so and the cool part is as we go throughout the year you know I have the the option to - there be times when Joe will be at the track and I can take advantage of that which will be nice and other times if I need to make a phone call and say hey this is what I'm feeling he can help walk me through that a little bit and then if we need to make changes when I get back you know I can get the parts off the bike in and if we need to make adjustments - yep and one of the beauties of the \u00f6hlins foot is the ease of of replacing the springs are right on top there you don't have to have a spring compressor to get them out it's going to be able to pull up on that cartridge - and stick a wrench in there and you're good to go as spring rates pretty important I mean that has a lot to do with how that bikes going to perform yeah and there's a lot of debate on that too you know again it depends on the tuner you work with some guys like them really stiff some guys like I'm softer right or preference certainly form or feel in the back when you're on the gas accelerating out of a corner no we're gonna be better not too tight on the camp and you hope didn't go that is something we may need to get in there and make a change so there's no need to refat capped out I need a lot of torque on that so that's pretty much the installation goes and you get a final setting recommendation from the Owens installation guide on where to set the compression rebound damping and a spring preload put them back in the biking go right alright man am I looking forward to that and as usual I've left it to the absolute last minute because I'm leaving next Thursday night and ironically it is one week away from now and I have a motorcycle and sitting there in a million pieces with a ton of parts to put on the plate before we go anywhere so just to recap the things that I really want to hit on okay is you see that it takes a lot to do is it takes a lot of tools it takes a lot of experience and there's a lot of little things that if you don't do them right all the money you spend on the Corp a cartridge kit you're just not going to receive the benefit from it that's that's true I mean it's a fairly simple installation but you need a few specialized tools and certainly there are a few techniques and fluids and greases to be used that maximize the whole performance of the character each so it's a good idea to have somebody who knows what they doing work with it at least we're talking what what's the install price 180 for me to installing your paired Forks that's about it and that's really affordable I mean you look at like we talked about let's see get into a little trouble there's like one tool that's 160 bucks I mean work it's we counted it up it's well over a thousand bucks for the tools yeah to do the service and some of that is worst-case scenario but then you have to have a voice on the floor and imagine if you use the Vice up here I mean you'd have to stand on top of the stool to service the fork so there's a number of good reasons to send it and what we really want to encourage you all to do if you're interested in something like this or if you're interested in a valve kit for the front forks send this stuff in his prices are super reasonable he's got a ton of experience and the best part is you've got like a real guy who you can actually get a hold of if you're having issues with setup it's going to help you and I think that's really important down the road even if he don't sound to me to use another tuner that when you get to the track and something's not working right and you need some advice you can give somebody a call that you've already dealt with and they can help you make some adjustments get you going in the right direction and that's it that is our 30ml \u00f6hlins cartridge kit install in our 2013 st g project blank", "1ksJXfPyvaM": "[Music]", "sEuk0k9QYtk": "nuclear grade well i got the spark plugs spark plugs i'm putting in my r1 because i'd run on mostly race fuel because of the cam that it's got in it is uh c-r-a-e-k makes for a hotter spark at colder temperatures i think or the other way around colder spark at hotter temperatures then i forgot which one it does that's one of the other i'm sure you guys will correct me on it nope i took both fairings i off the front part off and here's the uh here's the radiator just hanging disconnected now for the radiator fluid you have to use this special stuff right here motorcycle coolant um basically i just had to undo the mount right here undo the mount on the other side right there undo the bottom mount disconnect a few harnesses and this just literally drops right down for me to get my wrench in there so i thought i'd bring you guys around along for the ride it's a little bit of a tight squeeze it does have coil on plug as you can see i am not replacing the coils on this thing they're probably way too expensive we need to clean this bike i have to go back to napa i keep forgetting keep forgetting stuff uh this is the last sport player i take out all the other ones have been replaced and installed already and i'll show you how i put them in and what i actually put on them there we go there she is got a lot of white on it why isn't it focusing there she goes see that yeah that's the old one that's a new one see the difference see how this one's worn this one's not i'll take a picture of that all right see in a bit", "M69Pn7P7xTw": "[Music] but yeah boyo you scrubs I'll never know how  the camera shot I mean just the process about Authority so I've just finished those folks man it got very complicated but I chose the results from the gums around [Music] still do the luck stuff but here's the faith I'm really fed up you just do in parts you want your luck stunts in the half gallon anyway Tanja's what are we doing we all talk about the our waffles because they cease at the end of money shopping our books are free they pop trailer I'm kind of town who thought the hummus going oh I'll wake you up in the mornin right so completely lies on these many many complications crap [Music] 2012 which I have spoken my mother so they are offering all of the old buck leg cuffs of this kid really [Music] so right so really complications because I'm shortening this chair right my shorten is to when we leave the chrome that same length there's chrome in smash into here and you won't get full compression ie at the moment this goes all the way down to here so you know you've got your full range of suspension travel hmm but if we have a manufactured for short crows this will come down with stops fortified real short here some people are like man not doing shake staff or by it's a quick there's some things you can save pennies on especially breaks is not one of them if you're the time to skimp on suspension and rights well so next problem we found is that with this type of foreplay there's no pushing on the chrome the push in zoom in the hour so we all know the bushing that's down here underneath the foot cell but there's also all pushing us back here plus I've make the cried Schultz up the end of the font wakes up little bush it so when you try and compress the end of the fog that will bump in for that and lock the hopeful quick side so I have to control how much chrome is covered our cotton and also where the end of the fourth leg is in relation to that Bush it's okay when it's on the bike and it's got weight this so you do a wheelie this phone comes out when your land walks on by that so the device that controls event crime lipsticks at the bottom is cartridge so I've had to disassemble the cartridge and make the cars really set length to give me this is 110 mill I went back to the upside down folks out so I measured how much expunged probe there is some blocks are 100 someone thought they average is 120 I've done 120 all right middle there's still blood very long here from very low I could be making some free lunch spices some extra ones the damping is fantastic at the moment we're up here this is you know any settings that's for the customer to do say it's I can't set your hopes up if you were your boards with here and plate bring up sign when you send the folks back can you say about well now those Carl or your third stone seven stone you go around the racetrack we destroyed in the war don't do it customer you're the person was the pivot and it's something that's worth knowing but ridin along on my folks are soft it says in the manual turn this and it'll make them stiffer and they like I really don't wanna touch anything on too scared fui come an absolutely good with this yeah baby so do you find yourself shortly make and you need to abort lowers its combat down properly no loss of suspension travel no loss of suspension capability and adjustment it's all still there yeah fair enough I am going to do some other pretty loads with this but though you've got a boy who's that saw the bench I don't know I find my it's going to be but this is preset I can only make this gap smaller so there's about 20 mil of playin here depending also on how hot your happy box but it's like a fashionable build that new captain racer it's not like it's gonna be manually the race track you know I'm why I like direct bubbles I don't like this one but they don't stop what we're doing there don't write

alright so right now i will just blend everything together as you can see me doing [Music] so lovelies right now i've finished blending so i'll just shake everything together as you can see me doing there i will just open it up then i will just transfer my ingredients into my pot as you can see right now it's really really smooth it's not 100 smooth bed is perfect so right now i will go in with my pot i will just transfer all my evidence into my pots [Music] all right after i've transferred it's time to cook i will cook on a very low flame for 30 minutes guys when cooking please don't over process your evidence and cook on a very very low flame and when you are cooking continue to stir everything together because you don't want your evidence to get burnt so cook on a very low flame stir and also cook for 30 minutes not more than 30 minutes so after i cook mine for 30 minutes i off my flame i allow it to cool down for another 10 minutes so after 40 minutes look at how my evidence is looking as you can see it's not burnt okay all the nutrient is in there like intact all right so right now i'm going to strain the oil from the pop so i will go in with this my stuff this stuff is

looking they have melted up completely as you can see that will just take that one down then i will go in with my ginger and my rosemary oh yeah the one i made earlier on i will just pour everything together as you can see me doing so right now i'm going to stir everything together then after i stir i'll go in with my eyes blog this is the one i'll be using this where i'll be mixing all my evidence until it become the grease form and a pomade form so i'll just put in my evidence on top of the ice block like this that i am going to stir everything together so lovely this one is optional over here i have my dried rosemary plant i'll just apply some amount into my butter also my pomade into my grease as you can see this one you can skip this process then i'll go in with my essential

to that particular point then you just stop stirring and take your butter all your grease your grease done so after studying for almost 40 minutes look at the consistency and this is the perfect one i am going for if you want a thicker one you can continue stirring until you get the thicker paste if you want the lighter one you will still less if you want the medium or you cannot stay just keep

next time again remain blessed and you know what peace bye bye i love you all you", "RtTKckOtYX4": "[Music] hello ha today we're gonna learn a triplet and what that is is basically it's a little technique a color technique that you can use in your strum to give it a little bit more flavor and I also teach you how to incorporate that in a strum now that you're familiar with what it sounds like let's show you how to do it on the Colella so to do the triplet we're gonna use two fingers our thumb and our pointer finger and we're gonna do three movements so the first movement we get into our strumming position will go down with our first finger our second movement is our thumb will follow going down and the third and last we're gonna go back up with our first finger so that's it so let's try it now down no no no oh no no no now the secret to this is you're just twisting your wrist you're not moving your whole arm you're just twisting the wrist so that'll be easier and you can get the technique and the sound more crisp so as a side note also many people will do it different ways some people do down with your first finger you down with your thumb and back up with your thumb but I like to do it the way that I showed you originally it's just the easiest for me but again you can do it any technique that you feel comfortable with as long as the sound is crisp and the timing is good alright now let's practice it in a strum we'll just do a simple for beat down stroke and I want us to use the triplet on the second and the fourth beat alright and with the left hand will just do a C do it really slow one triplet 3 triplet 1 triplet 3 triplet 1 triplet 3 1 triple and 3 triple then so I'll play it for you a little bit faster so you can kind of hear how it sounds like [Music] so practice that on the second or the fourth beat and actually you can practice on any of the beats that you want just to mix it up and get familiar and you can add that to any strung so you can practice on the first the second or just mix and match a combination of all of them so that's it for this short and quick lesson for today it was nice and sweet just like all ukulele players out there but if you like this lesson please give it a thumbs up don't forget to subscribe and share and turn on the notification button and if you have Instagram go ahead and add me at JJ malari I would love to be

it's such a beautiful song I'm just gonna give you a little quick chord melody video tutorial so the Melody's is so I'm planing these seventh chords or the C minor seven D minor seven C minor seven D minor seven C minor seven D minor 7 and I end on there f 9 finally so I'm hoping you know your minor 7th chords if not go back to some of my other videos on seven chord inversions it's good to start simple and just get the shapes on your fingertips [Music] okay and then B sigh I'm doing a B flat 6 9 and then I start B flat 6 this is a good trick by the way if you don't already know this word here's B flat but I'm adding on the six here this snow that you and that makes it a B flat six course release was it's really technically a G minor try out of the B flat double but it kinda sounds more major e sounds brighter and happier so I call it a B flat six chord I can use that everywhere I love it and then six nine beautiful core that's a great Django chord I think that's what I used to end it and then B flat six we've got a ton of inversions just creating court melody movement that's the to me the art of chord melody on the next verse I kind of just help us f7 and just grab the whole melody right out of that chord shape using some open strings which I generally don't but in this case I am and then back to this B flat six and then this B flat six and I now the B section it's supposed to be a g7 chord but instead of just a mo g7 I'm diminishing he's in a diminished AB flat nine you don't know this trick another good trick for you to learn as a substitute I'm using D diminished seven over the g7 melody note diminished melody note diminish so those connecting those diminished chords and then the C minor and then slide it now I probably fancied it up a little bit I sometimes I'll do a walk down that little cliche walk down same thing here the e-flat minor I think maybe perhaps out I'll add a nine and if I'm if I'm just improvising that's a minor six nine then I might do the same here you know just slide it up three frets pretty easy quick trick and then the last a section and I guess I'll just travel on we have B flat six nine B flat six B flat 6 inversion B flat six nine there's that Jenga chord travel and that's a g7 actually is g9 up here you have to look at my tabs for this one in case you it's hard to see and then and then finally C minor 7 F 13 and then just plain will be flat 6 if I render or just to repeat it if I want to delay the ending I'd go D minor 7 flat 5 diminishes up there and then repeat that and then this classic Django style ending 1 and then maybe ended on that B flat 6 9 chord in that classic Indian if you don't already know it it goes like this one it's just a walk up from the 5 which is F and the key to b-flat and you want to get to B flat so it's one I use octaves so I'm doubling I'm muting so there's it looks like a chord but it's really just two notes and it's 1 and then and finally that shape there that's the B flat 6 9 chord beautiful ending chord and of course you just want to get you right in hand into it when you're playing this and kind of just groove you get the idea so I hope you had fun learning Avalon if you want the full PDF and everything go to my patreon site please join my patreon or consider I've got a ton of ukulele guitar it to me a guitar ukulele can learn from each other and that's kind of how I'm I'm kind of learning and trying to apply all that material onto the instrument so again you can learn the material learn all your chord shapes from everything from guitar and then just transfer it there's just kind of a transposition but all the shapes are the same I do have a low G thanks for watching we'll see you next time [Music] you", "5myN4FRhbME": "[Music] what's up travies all right so in today's video i'm going to be sharing with you guys one of my favorite hair and scalp oils it just infused with so much goodness i cannot wait for you guys to try it out but before we jump into the video i do want to share with you guys one of my favorite perfume brands of all times and that is dossier now their primary mission is to deliver only the best quality luxury inspired fragrances at a fair and transparent price let me tell you they have something for everyone now what i love about these bottles is when you get them on printed on the bottles they have the top notes the middle notes and the base notes for your perfume and they also have these really cool magnetic tops if you have little ones they won't be getting in there too easily which is perfect because you know how kids can be so i'm going to go ahead and drop a link down below so you guys can check them out and yeah let's get into the video all right so we are back to the oil so what we have here is chamomile which we're going to be infusing into the oils and then we have lavender look how beautiful these lavender buds are this oil is going to be bursting with floral medicinal properties you guys let me tell you and we also have rose now over time when this oil infused it's really just going to be pulling out the medicinal properties of these herbs into your oil all right so the first oil that is up is olive oil now we're going to be adding this into our oil now this oil is very penetrative and it penetrates into your hair fibers in a way that very few oils do it's very abundant in monosaturated fats which play a role in how deeply penetrative it is also it's very very hair strengthening so this is going to be our main base for our oil next we have a sweet almond oil now this is a lighter oil and it is used for dry scalp and dandruff now feel free to switch out whatever oils you want as your main base oil this combination works perfectly alright up next is castor oil so castor oil enhances the health of your hair follicles which promotes hair growth it also dramatically increases the rate of hair growth by up to five times as usual rate [Music] up next is grapeseed oil now grape seed oil is used for people who have finer hair but the amount of antioxidants in this oil is amazing and it also helps treat split ends and if you opt for this oil do be aware that if you have finer hair you can have a little bit of build up all right so next we're going to need something to put our oil in and i love to use these glass oil dropper bottles they're amazing and it looks really pretty when you put different herbs and flowers in there and not to mention it's really easy to apply oils to your hair and your scalp with it's not messy all right now these are the flowers that we're going to be using i have my chamomile my lavender and my rose now make sure that you're using flowers that are completely dried or herbs whatever you're opting to use because the water content in them will make your oil rancid and we don't want that so just make sure that it's dry all right now i've already filled up my bottle with my base oil which is going to be olive oil like i said plenty of times use what best suits your needs all right i'm going to go in with my grapeseed oil first i'm just going to go ahead and pour that in there now i just put my oats in these bottles because i thought it was really aesthetically pleasing more than showing you just plastic bottles all right next up is going to be my sweet almond oil and last but not least my castor oil all right so the first essential oil we're going to be using is rosemary which helps to thicken your hair and it also helps your hair grow i'm going to put about 10 drops of that just use however much you want next up is going to be lemongrass essential oil now lemongrass helps to reduce dandruff and it keeps your scalp flake free which is very essential for a healthy scalp and growth up next is peppermint oil which helps to improve both your hair thickness and your hair growth it also helps your growth during your anagen phase of your hair growth cycle next is lavender and lavender essential oil helps to speed up hair growth and also has properties that can generate hair growth of cells and reduces stress all right so next is our vanilla essential oil now it smells so amazing paired with all of these essential oils especially with the lavender but aside from that vanilla essential oil is so good when it comes to split ends and hair loss and it helps to strengthen the hair and then do some blood flow to the scalp all right now we're just going to add in our flower petals now i wish i would have added all of my dried flowers before i added the oil but it's okay so as i say not as i do add it before either you're using herbs or flowers just add them before you add your oil because you can fit a whole lot more in there all right and this is the finished product you guys it smells so amazing and it makes my hair so soft and it just does all kind of goodness for my scalp now i like to use this maybe about three times a week on my scalp and about four to five times a week on my hair just you know just to steal a little bit of moisture i hope you guys enjoyed this video let me know down below if you guys tried this and what are some of the things that you would swap out for the ingredients that i used i love all you guys don't forget to rate comment and join into the tribe and i will see you guys in my next video", "WaTNy3eKlds": "this is the bike before the rebuilt and idle bike is warm quite a bit of oil smokes coming out of the crankcase breather ventilation to more than I would expect okay so I've got the the top end of the motor cleared off that's the radiators come off the carburetors airbox and a little trick on the carburetors is to loosen the Allen heads that you can get to and basically just go ahead pop the carburetors right off some of those Allen head hose clamps are really hard to get to but in removing it you don't really have to loosen them all just go ahead and pull it right off then restore the rubber piece loosen all the Allen heads now that the carburetor assembly is off and then just snug them up when you get them back on from here I'm going to take the head cover off and and perform the leak down tests where I check some valves and do basic inspection at the top end but at this point the bike is apart enough where it's not going to run again until the motor is refreshed alright now I've got the head cover off and the two cams exposed this is going to allow me to make sure that I'm at top dead center on the compression stroke the other part you're going to need is to take the timing case cover off and this will allow you to turn the crank over and position the position the valves correctly to perform the leak down okay I've got so under one now top dead center and I know that because the camshaft lobes are facing away from each other so I bring my finger down these here and on the other side over here and then coming down to the timing case there's a top dead center mark right there which aligns to an indicator mark right here on the case so we're ready for the leak down on cylinder one okay so I've now put my leek down test two into cylinder one after having read sparkplug I'm using a US general leak down tester there's already some folks on YouTube that have good videos of using this particular tool so I'm not going to go into it too much I can move my adjustment here on the second valve to zero it a bit we'll dial it back in these are a little finicky and again I want close to zero I'm not too crazy about having that it's perfect and then you go ahead and apply your gauges into your cylinder so this is cylinder one and what I can see here is my leak down is right at 30% the other thing I can do is check for the source of where the leak is crank case breather hose no leak they're coming right out the carburetor inlet I feel a little bit of air coming in there but overall 30% not too shabby let's go on to cylinder 2 okay so now I'm going to set up four cylinder to my factory manual says that top dead center on cylinder 2 is 180 degrees so I'm going to spin this around 180 this is why there's a mark this kind of H symbol on the other side I'll line that up with the mark on the case I'll come back up here and I'll look to see if my lobes are facing away from each other on cylinder 2 which they are I now know I'm at top dead center on the compression stroke I'll remove the plug put my tube in and we'll do the leak down on cylinder 2 I've removed my spark plug from cylinder 2 I've inserted my test hose the other thing I want to mention about these particular testing units is they're pretty sensitive to high air pressure coming in so make sure you set your compressor down under 100 power I have my regulator set to about 60 pounds right now anything over 100 pounds into this tool will probably break it so again we'll do a quick calibration on this tool we'll get it in the ballpark of zero it's a little finicky about to worry about exact I've got the tube seated nicely on here and put it in and we've got some moderate leakage and cylinder to just shy of 50 percent and I can hear the air escaping so let's see if it's coming back out through the carburetor yeah I feel some air pressure coming out there feel a little bit in the crankcase breather tube as well that's a pretty significant leak down right there so I know when I expect cylinder to I'm probably going to find some issues though okay now we just finished cylinder two and I'm going to jump to cylinder four because top dead center on the compression stroke for cylinder four is 180 degrees from cylinder - don't move my indicator mark back right about there I'll come up and make sure that my valves the cam lobes are pointing opposite each other for cylinder four which they are now I know in the top dead center on the compression stroke hearing now one thing I want to mention about this is I have a fitting on the end of this tube to fit the spark plug hole and one thing you don't want to have happen is as you screw this tube in for this piece to stay in the engine block as this some screws from here so I've got this turned in pretty tight and then I just go finger tight when I screw this into the cylinder and it's got an o-ring here so it doesn't need to be very tight to get an airtight seal so drop it in stood on the four give it a few turns I feel like hit the o-ring and then we're good to go I've got my compression test tool set we throw it on cylinder 4 and still before releasing at about 40% not quite as bad as Scylla be to force the cylinder 1 I also hear quite a pronounced air escape and again I can pretty much hear it coming out of still out of the carburetor Inlet here there you go so quite a bit of air escaping coming back out through the car blew right on the cylinder number three alright I'm gonna finish up with cylinder 3 another 180 degree turn or a total of 540 degrees from where we were at top dead center on the first shoulder back to the second set of marks lined up on my case right about there come up check my lobes pursuing the three intake pointed out in this direction off and exhaust pointed out the other direction opposite I know on the top dead center here alright I back up while Sylvester you finished up quick mention that I normally have all these openings covered stick a paper towel or something in you don't want dirt debris small things falling in there I have it open so it's easier to see okay whit cylinder 3 and we've got our leak down unit calibrated and it looks like we're right at about 30% leak down all the cylinder 3 not as much air coming out of the carburetor this time looks like we're getting a different week on cylinder 3 so it'll be quite interesting to get down further in the motor and see what's going on here but that wraps it up I mean we're in the ballpark between our 30 and 45 across all the cylinders pretty much about what I expected next up we're going to drop the motor out we'll take the top end out and hopefully we'll get in there and inspect the cylinders to see what's going on", "YwRkHHeJb40": "hi I'm Todd video comm awesome high-five welcome to another one of our how-to videos for yamaha our once for bike riders today we're going to show you everything you need to know on how to remove and replace your spark plugs today we're doing this job on a 2004 Yamaha r1 let's get started so you can get your fix we've started by removing the mid pharynx off of the bike the next step we're going to do is we're going to loosen the radiator from the mounting bolt or mounting points there's three bolts I'm going to lay that forward to access the spark plugs okay so you have three mounting points for the radiator one at the bottom it's a ten millimeter on the backside on a five minam five millimeter allen on the front so there's your your lower point allen wrench is already on the bolt there and there's two 10 millimeter guys that are going to grab the frame at the top of the radiator I've got to remove all three of those right right there ten millimeter and that's going to be another one on the other side in the identical place next we're going to get the bolt at the top and you twist the forks a little bit it's kind of tight but it'll give you just enough room get that guy loose loose where I'm going to remove that completely on both sides there's a caller washer that comes out with it hang on to that very important don't lose that guy the other side same thing turn the forks to access a little bit of room in there and support the radiator with one hand a little bit and remove the collar bolt you know take the radiator and gently rock it out pull it forward as much as you can it's not going to come too far it's attached here to the coolant line so you're basically just accessing yourself a little bit of room so you can get in from the other side and pull your iroquois 'l broad caps from the left side of the motorcycle with the radiator pull a little bit forward we're going to start pulling the plug caps and these are going to be a little bit tough to get off sometimes just kind of twist and pull up measure your plug cap go ahead and just pull all those at the same time a lot of people say do one at a time I just pull them all and kind of get it out of the way and I reach in same thing twist and pull number two and on down the line when it gets to number four it's going to be pretty hard to get to you might go to the other side and pull that up and pull those all the way up and I just kind of like the lamb let them out in the front there between the radiator and the engine okay so again pulling a number four plug I'm getting it from from the left side of the bike some people may find it easier if you're not a skinny arm little twig like me to get your hand in there and pull that sucker out you can't access it from the other side I just I can do it all from here precise the way I go to five-eighths spark plug socket of course that's going to grab the spark plug if you use a regular 5/8 it's not going to pull the plug out it's probably not going to be deep deep enough either but this is a regular 5/8 and a short extension I'm going to take and drop that into the number 1 you're going to feel it engage on the on the plug and take your driver and back that thing out of there until it's loose enough to spin off that is not bringing my plug out with it so we're going to do a little trick with some fuel some fuel line I'll show you okay so my spark plug wrench which was not taking my plug out kind of kind of a bummer we're doing a little trick with some just some fuel line your plugs just down there floating around smash a fuel line down on it pull your plug out if you can also use this for reinstallation it actually makes it pretty easy to do drop it down in the hole what comes time to reinstall them just spin that guy till they grab and you can do that until it gets tight enough to put your wrench on it so just a little trick with fuel line and as we get down to number three and number four this actually comes in quite handy for pulling those out of there so we're going to check those plugs actually look like they're burning just fine good color not a lot of corrosion doing what they're supposed to do and set that to the side and go to number two and pull that out where's number one so we're on number two it's in there this is not extremely difficult just be patient it's kind of hard to get get a good grab with everything once that breaks loose you can pretty much remove your driver and just use your hand just spin it or again I like to use that fuel line just get it on top of the plug press you can spin that guy and got a lot of play makes it pretty easy to do so basically got number two out if you don't have just fuel line laying around your garage like I do you can get this at any auto parts store I want to say this is about quarter inch lime this is a clear line assembly going to be black or gray but just any any fuel line will work and it does the job fine actually make a little tool that's a little rubber sparkplug remover that's got a little handle on the end that I've had and used that works really well but that's just a little cheater make the job easier we see we're burning well good color knots not a lot of corrosion or anything up in there so we're pretty happy with the way those are looking there and moving on to number three also a note if you're taking these out to see how the bikes running or burning cylinders you might want to lay them out in a particular order number one number two number three number four maybe draw on some cardboard or some paper so you remember which cylinder each plug came out of so you can tell if there are all the same or if burn enrich or or lean on most modern fuel-injected bikes they're all going to be pretty much the same unless you've got problems okay so dig in for number three sitting there pretty far you try to make a little bit of room and again should be able to just break that loose couple of turns once it's loose take your driver out and just spin it by hand it it's just a lot easier again my plug wrench is not grabbing the spark plug so use a little cheater fuel line here alright and threes out again looks fine I'm going to go all the way over to four it's getting kind of tricky for the space a couple couple turns to break it loose and then it usually will spin out with your fingers if it's not staying spinning out with your fingers then somebody hasn't used NSCs grease on it or or somebody's crossed her and put them in I'm going to try from the other side cuz that's fighting me there so if you can't get to the number four from the left side of the bike you just move around either try from the front or from the other side this is usually the most difficult one because you've got a lot of stuff in your way over here as far as the radiator hose in the wiring - alright so here comes number four and looks the same as the others so we're doing really good so we've removed our plugs check them normally we would be installing the new plugs putting some copper anti-seize on the threads before we reinstall these are all sitting just fine so we're not gonna replace them with new plug but I would highly recommend that every time you take a plug out you put in a plug in alright so when we're reinstalling the plug we don't want to just drop it down into the plug hole take a chance on bending the tip here and screwed up your gap so we're going to gently put it down in the hole and spin it till it catches so that's started and I'm just moved to number one because it was the easiest it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what were you for the back in I was just going down to the gasket and then go about a quarter of a turn but there's probably a torque spec not to over-tighten not that anybody's going to put a torque wrench on it spark plugs but but so to answer the question of when to replace your plugs according to the Yamaha genuine manual here your spark plugs are going to be checked at 4000 replaced at 8 checked to 12 replaced at 16 check at 20 so basically check every 4,000 miles or every oil change if you're following the manual and replace every other oil change which is pretty close to what what I do again we've just checked these and they're all fine we're not going to replace them maybe next time around we'll put new ones in so don't worry about cleaning your spark plugs if they if they look dirty corroded suspect in any way shape or just replace them cleaning the spark plugs kind of the old school thought there they're cheap enough to just put a new one in every time don't don't cheap out when it comes to your engine good luck getting a torque wrench in there I just go until they come on the crush washer and then go a quarter turn past that remember don't crank down on these last thing you want to do is break or strip a spark plug down in the cylinder so nine point four foot-pounds or just get them down kind of tight finger tight and then give them a quarter turn past that is usually just fine okay so this is just a tip when we're replacing a spark plug cap your this is obviously for demonstration you're going to want this to click a couple times and lock in so when you're pushing those down no just softly put them down on the plug because the rubber boots going to grab the plug but you really want that engagement where it really clicks into place and that doesn't come out of that you're going to kind of fight that out just make sure when we're putting those caps back on you push them down good getting tight so we're going to start do that actually pull these back up into place one at a time all right so there's a ball lock down pretty good little twist and make sure the wires are all want to run into where they need to run which is just kind of up and out of the way the radiator want to put that back you can see in there all of our wires are above the plug caps reassembly here we've got our sparkplug caps down tight spark plugs in go back up with this so we lift that up okay so as we lift the radiator there are some wires that come from the wiring harness to the headlights or the frontal bike you want those to be on the outside of the radiator tab not between the tab and the frame so just make sure you don't pinch those when you're when you're pushing the lady up into place I'm going to start by setting the lower bolt to kind of hold the radiator and I'm just going to run that in and loosely put that in place that's going to kind of hold the radiator for me to install the upper bolts that hold it to the frame again we've got the collars and the boat make sure you put it back together with those I turn the handlebars to get a little little room okay so these are the wires that you don't want to pinch so just make sure those are on the outside we're going to kind of maneuver the radiator up just give a little push get in line and loosely install this side case we've got a caller our bolt over here again just kind of loosely installing that and then we're tighten everything up once we make sure everything's running out should be started so again we tighten those down we've made sure we haven't pinched any any of the wires between the radiator and the frame there's probably on your bike there's going to be a zip tie that you can adhere this to the top of the radiator if it's not there don't worry about it this bikes got a lot of miles on it some of those things have come off and not been replaced so you'll probably want to go ahead and start the motorcycle make sure she starts up and everything's fine before you replace the mid bearings after it started everything looks and sounds good replace them in fairness you gotta be good to go ride okay so now you seen us remove and replace all four spark plugs we did them all four at the same time we removed all four at the same time generally want to do one at a time reason for that is you don't want anything to fall down into your open cylinders there it's going to be best if you do them one at a time I keep my bike pretty immaculate so we just pull them all for replace all four it's a little easier for me alright once again we've just shown you how to remove and replace the spark plugs on your 2004 Yamaha r1 be sure to LIKE comment and subscribe I'll answer your questions in the comments and you can go to our web videos com for our email address you can find us on Facebook Pinterest and Twitter I'm Todd with our own videos com we'll see you next time for another how-to video thanks for watching Oh No", "aQIHv7oFaRs": "today in the vise we have a 2009 to current r1 front fork now with this particular bike the right leg does rebound the left leg does compression as far as the servicing goes both Forks are identical into the level of detail we will go into so every step is identical if you were going to do a revolve and take the cartridge apart then obviously you would only do one fork at a time and you will need a ton of special tools to do all of that so for the servicing we're going to show you which is a complete teardown we will be able to replicate that process on to the next fork so there's nothing to worry about there and we're going to take this apart and do a full service on it let's take you step-by-step through the process and it's very important that you do not forget the step 1 2 3 4 I always like to put a little bit of grease on the cap so the next time it's disassembled it's much easier so we've backed off the vise we're going to go ahead and pull the outer tube up to the cap", "OOgepdL71T8": "okay so I decided to sell the 2002 Yamaha r1 just gonna do a quick video show you that it does run and I go over a few things that are on it as I said yes it is a 2002 Yamaha r1 the mileage is 21,000 I believe maybe a little over I'll take you around it it is in I would say really good shape for the year it's the rare colors color scheme I just put a new rear tire on it Shin Co it's a 200 back tire it's got a custom undertale dual exhaust you know like I said it is in great shape I can show you that it is cold put my hand on the header it is cold I'll start it here in just a second the front tire is in really good shape no dents very very minimal scratches for the year of it and it's in really good shape more accessories I've put the K&N air filter in it and I just put a new Scotch steering stabilizer on it works out really well everything does work on it it's a real smooth bike I can show you that it does have a Power Commander on it I don't know much about them but apparently they make it run better chains good suspension all feels good it's not just about everything that you could put into it we'll go ahead and start it up as you can see the temperature is low let it warm up does the hair if you also need any pictures of anything or if you have any questions please feel free to contact me but everything's straight on found four oh my like I also have a backseat Lord I'll be giving a helmet with it and jacket upon full asking price well hope you like it if you're interested please give me a call", "cJBOya9ucWI": "all I want to say is that these theories are a to take off just finished printing coolant the engine I school and this carrying right here Hania takeoff Carter was out so hopefully get it running up up and running pretty soon", "dAwpbdcse7A": "sup guys I'll try to make this short and concise which I have a very hard time doing so yesterday I had a bit of an oil leak 206 mm stick em ha are one bit of an oil leak coming from the stator I was just the gasket it was a little shoddy and I'm sadly we're using it again because another one's not here yet but anyway so I put it all back together jumped on it started making a weird like a whirling noise that I've never heard before and I've replaced probably 2 Staters on this by two rectifiers and the generator the old shitty generator with the old Magnus network computing side I've got the new one and it never had a problem so I jumped on it and it just started making a weird ass noise came back sure it ate for whatever reasons it shoot the bearings inside the stator cover I'm not sure why and this thing was a to get off because obviously that created a ton of heat and normally this the generator can get pulled off pretty easily off from the stators stator is like you know screw it in there but this thing would not come off so I kind of had to just use a little tap and this end part right here this nipple thing skirt goes right inside there that hole obviously so if you have an issue with that and yours gets kind of superheated just put a cloth over it and tapped it right out no problem long story short so that's that was the bearing was causing all the issues and so I look at the state or to the state which IV trashed is burnt a lot of the coils were burned too so I know there's a lot of talk and I get the forums and  last night everyone's like I don't know the bearings look fine this looks fine standard looks fine if everything looks fine I don't really know what what the issue is then I'm sorry sad to say because it makes I got some bites just make weird noises but mine personally chewed the front stator cover bearings luckily I had spare pieces for everything you know but so that was my issue now the hardest thing honestly to do this is rewire the stator through the little tiny area in here and go underneath the tank and then come back and plug into the rectifier which it probably had take me an extra hour to like because I have fat ass hands to squeeze it in there but most are short if your bike is making a weird noise coming from the stator don't ride it I wrote it 540 miles yesterday to probably shoot it up I could have made me save this state recover bearings like didn't so if you hear weird noise and check it out take it off inspect the stator the bearings the rotors you know this generator smashing rotor the old one had magnets piece of magnets glued inside and I looked at mine the first time about a year and a half ago we started making weird noises and and the magnets were just like soup was like metal charred soup shredded but so hopefully that helps", "epZntQ6WHOw": "i'm going to be showing you how to do a cooling coolant change on your 2007 yamaha r1 this is a 2007 yamaha r1 right here and this is what you're going to need i'm going to be using this the engine ice right here i'm going to be putting it into the coolant system and what we're going to be flushing it out with is some distilled water you want to make sure it's distilled water not any other water i'm going to come to this side of the right side of the bike and right here i'm using a 3 16 allen wrench and you're just gonna pop these off like that and there's one right here too just gonna pop all those off and once you pop that off you want to come over to this side and you're going to want to take off the bottom side on this side so just make sure you get all all these right here off you're going to want to come out here and take your blinker out [Applause] finally so now once you have everything off the bikes look like this right here right here we're gonna come down here we're taking off this boat right here this boat's gonna be the one already have it loosen you want to make sure you always have something to drain your runoff fluid into so it's going to run off but in this video in this video i already already drained my bike with the previous coolant so now i'm just going to pour water and flush it through now you're back on the right side of the bike take that off and now your fluid your old fluid should be running from there should be running it should be slowly pouring out but i told you i already drained mine so now what we're going to do is grab the funnel stick the funnel in slowly pour water doing it properly now you see that drain water is coming out and that means everything's getting flushed out right now everything's getting flushed out and cleaned out cleaning out the system making sure everything's gonna run smooth when we put the engine ice into the coolant while that's draining out we're gonna come over here loosen these up alright loose this one's broken so forget that one and i gotta unscrew this one out and then we're just gonna rinse out this reserve we're going to rent out that reserve right now after i get this bolt off bolt off and just pull out like that bam it's going to pull out i'm just going to get now we're just going to grab your distilled water fill this up shake it around dump it out i'll reset after you're done cleaning it out reassemble it so just plug it back in put it on top screw it tighten down tighten that down bam i'll come over here make sure it's done

if you like my channel subscribe I appreciate all the love I'll support all right guys", "sJFhqR-VJlY": "hi guys welcome to another venture of while a monkey today we're actually going to be doing an oil change in this 2010 our one so let's get to work so a first thing you'd want to do is actually run your motorcycle and oh that was bright you want to start and run it to get to temperature but with it was take the fairing side fairing out the bottom fairing out it's really easy there are the vault you slide that in there you need a 17 millimeter socket and get underneath take the drain plug out and the oil will fall there you go guys you guys can see all the oils gonna come out nature's way so that's all that's draining you can come over here take the oil cap off then now you have to remove this fairing so you can get to the oil filter and it's right there see those two bolts same allen wrench on the other side you'll come right out you can't really see it but dry between the headers can't really see the oil filter by try between the headers it's black if you want to use the OEM filter I recommend you get a one of these she's just an extension help you get it out with one of these caps that goes right in the oil filter knew that would make the job of taking the oil filter a breeze and putting it in a breeze so otherwise there is a KNN oil filter for Yamahas and i already has socket welded at the top so you'll be able to do it so either way now time to put this bad boy on and here we go [Music] okay so if you guys can see basically just wiggle then we'll filter in there and it helps I have a small hands you have bigger hands this will be actually very problematic since you don't have that much room to play with yeah uh-huh did not give you a lot of room at all well here we go put the cap on put the extension make sure remember clockwise to Tainan make sure that you're going clockwise you don't want to go crazy with this just want to make sure it's in there so don't over tighten it we're gonna cross your filter before you do I'm gonna put the L cap back on the old cap it's right here right next to the headers go right in there get your seventeen millimeter socket make sure you're going clockwise grip on it and tight remember oil pans are really expensive so you don't want to go crazy with it but at the same time you don't want to leave it loose where you're leaking so just tying it to till you can't no more pretty much but don't go crazy try it out over tighten it you so after you're all done putting the fairings on you want to start it up warm up the motorcycle get to normal engine temperatures and then you're gonna check and make sure that the oil level is fine since they you put in the oil you need to go through the motor you might need to add a little more or not you'll see okay no you can't [Music] [Music] and shut it off now we check the oil right there is between the two lines you can't really see if it's between the two lines two markers that you'll see there so that's perfect and then she's ready for watching this will be it for this adventure if you want me to elaborating something else leave some comments below I'll let you know it's fairly easy to do time-consuming and annoying and it's a little bit of a dirty job so if you don't want to get dirty just take it to your dealer they will do it or you can stay at home and do it either or remember stay wily please comment like subscribe and stay tuned there's a lot more to come while a monkey all right now [Music]", "NjNoxSjitYA": "[Music] hey what's up all you lovely learners out there in learning land Tyler from 10 thumbs procom coming at you with another eco lady tutorial like we do every single Wednesday and Saturday today we're breaking down autumn leaves in the chord melody style I'm gonna have all the tabs on the screen but you can get printable tabs for this lesson and all our lessons by becoming a patreon links up in the notes as well as the description so let's go ahead and grab our oka Lily brain an attention span when you have those three things we can go ahead and break this down and start to play ukulele together come on in and let's do it rock and roll all right so I'm gonna go ahead and just jump into the chords mostly easy one particular chord that's made kind of funky but I'll show you another way around it if it's just too complicated a minor d7 you can't play the Barre chord feel free to do this Hawaiian d7 - OH - OH doesn't actually have a D note in it G major 7 Oh - 2 - nice chord C major 7 just the second fret instead of the 3rd fret we have an F sharp minor flat 5 which is kind of like a chord I invented for this one this is the hard chord pinky on the fifth fret ring on the 4th pointer on the 2nd open a if this is too hard just play an F sharp minor it's not quite as jazzy but it's gonna support the harmony perfectly okay and it's not gonna change the key or anything like that be seven good news we're not playing the bar chord though we're playing this shape which is just like our E minor but everything up a fret 4 2 1 open a the graphic has it full bar but we're gonna have the open a string move that down you'll see both an E minor graphic plays the 4th fret of the G I like the open G in E minor 7 and what else f-sharp are an F diminished 7 which is 1 2 1 2 nice chord and a C sharp minor 7 flat 5 which sounds a lot harder it is pointer finger first rid of the C ring finger 2nd fret of the a okay so let's just jump in the first three measures sound like this [Music] okay and what i'm doing here is on the first measure it's a rest on the first beat one open E string second fret and then I play the open high G you could play the third fret if you wanted to so it goes one two three four one we're gonna make that a minor but we're gonna use our index finger because we're gonna get our ring finger on the third fret of the a string and then you see those little arrows what those are doing is they look like they're going up but if you think about it see how the arrows closer to the a string those are just down strums which means we're having no melody in that part that's just harmony to keep it moving so the first two measures would be one two three four one two three four make that d7 no melody one then you're gonna keep that finger down second fret of the C string lift it up open e second fret and then the first chord of the next parts of G major seven just so you know so those first three measures we get one two one two three [Music] all right the next three measures start off with that G major 7 stromboli through your thumb second beat with your index finger third beat with your thumb fourth beat with your index finger one two three four to a C major seven just a down one then our melody kicks back in to open C string second fret open E and then we make the super crazy chord with the open a as the melody note again f-sharp minor if you want something a little easier but not quite as cool okay and then we get one two three so those three measures we get one two three one two one two three it's hard chord before that's the stretch it's a tricky chord but it sounds cool all right in then to the next three measures we're make our b7 drum through in the first beat one second fret the wrist jump all the way through with our thumb on the third beat so we got that eighth note making the melody which gives us a chance to really harmonize it with the whole chord and then the third fret and what I do here is with my middle finger I just roll over there and then open E alright so those that first measure and the first beat we get [Music] I then strum an E minor for one beat a minor seven then an E minor a minor for two beats back to the e minor for one or for two beats and then I'm gonna take this finger here on the third fret move it up to the third fret on the second fret up to the third then open e so those three measures we get one two three four one two three four one two three all right that's some tasty Ness now we're gonna jump into the next three measures and we get this bad boy again with this note being the melody that's too tricky if sharp minor still works again folks we're gonna go oh and then with this finger here you're gonna roll over and grab that B note two three four and just strum so we get one two three with the F sharp minor that would look like this two three hardest measure in the song maybe the second hardest two three four B seven and that b7 will beat with no melody justice Trump one to remove this pointer fingers come through three back down to then we're gonna drop everything down a fret and make that a minor show me to the third fret why do we play up to that first beat with those two measures up to that first beat really slow one two three four one two three all right a little tricky and from there you just going to strum through the E minor - let's do those three measures a little more up to speed two three one two three two three random shred I like to flash mob my own videos alright jumping into the next three measures we're over halfway done with this tune we are going back to the a minor I wonder if they made a song called spring flowers if it would be as melancholy probably not you probably reharmonization like G major because spring flowers alright random thought so we're still with the E minor I call these throwaway strums I mean it's just an index finger no melody one third fret second fret third fret a minor so cool too [Music] for d7 throwaway strum 1 d2 then you're gonna get that pinky on the fifth fret another D note in your strum all the way through your D third fret and then that's gonna go to a g7 which sounds great my favorite part in the song these three measures we get one two three four one two three one two three four one love that but play it without counting just cuz I love the way it sounds [Music] love that so good so we get to this G major 7 we're gonna do pop make that G note pop on the first beat 1 2 3 4 that F diminished chord really nice movement from love that progression but we're going to strum through it two times and then play the first fret second fret into everybody's favorite chord but this time we're gonna make it a little different we're gonna make that hawaiian d7 and get that pinkie here now i'm using this as a substitute for this crazy chord that we've seen a couple times but in this particular part this shape is going to work for us 1st fret of the g string 2nd fret of the E string with your ring pinky on the 3rd fret your so you're gonna strum through with your thumb in one make the third fret pop again to remove your pinky thumb for alright so those three measures 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 this is where it's gonna get crazy back to the beasts okay next three bars we only have six more to go we're almost through and we'll do a play long we're gonna make our b7 but this is really kind of a B seven flat nine we'll see that a little ater you're gonna strum through the first three cause you want this F sharp to be the melody note two three to throwaway strums then you're gonna move this keep these two fingers down and swing your ring finger way down to the third fret of the a and strum through just the bottom three strings I'm using my thumb to mute that G and this is a b7 sharp nine talk about jazzy chords I mean if PD pants is cool consider me Miles Davis kind of jazzy right so we get two three four right into an E minor one throw a strum a minor seven three throw a strum and then you just the second fret will become the first fret remove your middle finger pointer finger down c-sharp minor 7th flat 5 one throw away strum you're gonna strum through the first three strings because you want this Ino to be your melody you'd even pluck these two in the middle if you wanted all the way through and you're gonna throw away on a C major seven so those three measures we get two three one two three four one two three three more measures and you can do these a couple different ways I have it written out as the end like hypothetically if you were to play through this one more time but I'll talk about how you can turn it over we're gonna need our favorite chord the f-sharp minor flat five again with the melody being the a note feel free to replace it again with an f-sharp minor you're gonna go one and then if it's the last time through I let it ring out I go one two three if I'm gonna go back to the beginning of song I go one two three okay so the tabs have it written out as a finish but you can just fill those empty spaces with strum and then go back to the top one two three G we're just gonna remove that pinky play the open g b7 again down to the third fret to or let it ring out one two third fret B note now this B note is actually really a low B so if you have a low G it's gonna sound way better down low it'll match the melody the melody doesn't rise there it lowers but it's still the same B note and it keeps kind of the essence of the song B and then you're just gonna play an open e and then e minor 7 1 2 3 or you just let that II bring out why don't I play through this one time like I'm gonna finish the song and then I'll play through it again like I wasn't going to finish the song here we go one two three two three four two three four all right let's pretend like I'm gonna go back to the beginning of song one two three one two three four and then you're back in the top alright so that's how you play it why don't we go ahead and play through the whole thing nice and mellow I am going to just count I'm gonna go one and then we're gonna jump in because gonna go one two three four and the tune I'll count the first measure and then I just want you to play along with me from the very top let's go ahead and rock this tune out together alright one two three four [Music] thank you so much for watching the very end Tyler from 10

"JPj3u_OSGOs": "alright folks I want to show you how to play your ripple by Grateful Dead I love this song and I just wanted to give you a couple tips the courts are pretty easy some of the the tab that you find on the Internet shows you play in the refrain of the course or whatever you want to call it with the a minor D G a C and and then you go back to an a minor I don't like that a minor the second time around I play it with an a7 and I think if you'll try it you'll you'll find that works a lot better for you of course the song seeking download from my songbook absolutely free the other thing that I like about this song is I like to do it as finger picking style if my words people go to sunshine in my attempt this will played on the heart strong so if you want to do the finger style thing I certainly encourage playing around with that now if as you know I hate telling people strum patterns or finger picking style patterns I think as an artist you should just let that come through do it organically and let express yourself whatever way your brain tells you to express yourself but I do understand that some people especially beginners like to be able to figure out what somebody's doing sort of thing we created so I'm gonna I'm gonna go ahead and video me doing my right hand while I play a verse and part of the refrain so that way if you want to you can you can study that and and do the finger picking style that I'm doing but again I would encourage you to just flail away with your fingers while you're playing the chords and figure out what you like to hear and let that come through and don't think about it too much just let it happen anyway hopefully you enjoy playing this song [Music] [Music] [Music] with God [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "GMLEp7c79rU": "all right guys this video is for a 2008 yamaha r1 um gonna replace the coolant uh seems to be like mine was empty for whatever reason so i decided to refill it and it's pretty simple so all you have to do is uh take out the bolts from the fairing from all over so a couple in the bottom couple on the top and uh there's some uh little nut screws in these i need to have to take it off because it worked out for me and um so all it is is you have your reservoir right there and you just pretty much take this cap off and you fill it with your coolant i already did that already and close it back up and if you want to flush it it's a completely different uh not completely same process but you just have to there's a bolt right underneath and that side and the opposite side you have to take this fairing out but i didn't need to flush mine so um that's pretty much it i also just want to show you this the coolant i used i got this at my local cycle shop and uh that's pretty much it hope you guys enjoy the video um subscribe share comment let me know what you guys think all right", "yjDXcsTPPTw": "hey guys if you don't have a bike stand you can use this technique to clean your chain just take car lever and just put it like this the back wheel you can you can rotate the bead like this in chain I'm using the star change loop this one initially to clean the chain I'm

technical clip on the 2016 Yamaha r1 front folks as you can see it's got a grub screw that holds the folks tension in the grub screw is a factory fitted item so what happens is from the factory they taught Annette to a certain specification and a damages damages the threads on the actual stanchion so what happens is when guys install cartridges like these ones over here the cartridge fits inside that fork the fork foot on the stanchion holds the whole cup down and therefore the cartridge screws onto the the the actual cup so what happens is I've seen a couple of them happen where guys remove the grub screw and", "-hp2hEmAazg": "hey what's up you guys the ak-47s here and look who I got amber is back so a lot of you all even since I first brought her home were requesting that I do a walk-around and mods kind of video and I apologize really quickly for this being on my GoPro because I hate shooting stuff like this with my GoPro but my phone is completely full and my camera the autofocus noise is annoying is crap with the lens that I want to use for it so I'm using my GoPro but I'm shooting it in 2.7 K so hopefully that will make up for it but it is time to do my walk-around and kind of a mods list and stuff like that of my r1 and I have hopefully this whole like light correct for you guys like exposure correct but I have my big list here my mods so it's a long list it's gonna be a long video but it's a sweet bike so without further ado got my flashlight and we're going to get to this so first things first if y'all can see in here we got my golden headlight rings that go around the the low beam bulbs on both sides it gives it just kind of like a really cool angel eye kind of effect look I like it a lot got the golden forks so you got gold forks and I'm by the way

really nice then you got the tinted women up here I don't really know the brand but it does give you a good bubble of air protection there it's a pretty good windscreen I really like it is easy to duck down and get under next thing you can't really see very well but up there that's my aftermarket radiator so it doesn't have the stock radiator it has an aftermarket radiator then we have up here if you can see in here we have my Yamaha steering damper down there which is nice and then we have steel braided front brake lines as you can see and we also have steel braided rear brake lines as you can see so those are always nice and then we got what else we got alright we have the gold ASB unbreakable levers so they Bend out so they don't snap off and they also have a lifetime warranty so if

turn signals they're really nice see a yeah there you go so that's what they look like so got the hot bodies turn signals and then we got what else we got all right so we got these right here Elmo if you can see them you got these quarter-turn fairing bolts all over the place to light all over the place with a quarter turn bolts instead of actual screws so if you want if you need to take something off you just lift it up like that and turn it and then it's just literally like a quarter turn so now just do that and now it's out there's the bolt then turn it back in put it in turn it push a thing back just really really makes it easy for you to take fairings off very quickly no tools required instead of having bolts like this everywhere we have to get the tools out and screw me and all that kind of stuff so got those and then my dog wanted to say hi I guess hey dog she's scared of my bike alright so then we got the carbon-fiber accents which we got the carbon fiber right here along the intakes like the ram air tubes right here we have the carbon fiber right there and you have the carbon fiber up here in the cockpit area which then goes up under here by the dash on both sides as well as comes down on the other side over here and then back down over this way so we got those carbon-fiber accents right there as well as under in here this whole front piece right here is all carbon fiber as well it's dirty from the rain but this is all carbon fiber in here as well I'm gonna go back here alright and then we got these are one block off plates up here the mirror block off plates

ring around the tachometer up there on the dash and then we have what are called pro bolts we have golden Pro bolts all over the place there goes my flashlight alright what sucks let me get my well there we go alright so got the golden Pro bolts down there up here basically everywhere where there's not one of these quick connectors is replaced with a pro bolt so all up in here and they're all up in here on these things back on that down here all these are pro bolts so those are really high quality bolts like really high quality bolts and they're golden bullet and then other you some of the other ones are also gold titanium bolts we've got the clear pro grip tank protector right there as well as I'm not going to take my seat off but we have a speedo healer in here as well as a Power Commander and there under the seat I'm not going to take those off though and then we have a minus one counter shaft sprockets so a minus one sprocket up front the back is stock gearing okay and then we have these you the best way to do this okay the right side we have the blue Samko hoses throughout the whole thing you can see them up in there yeah the whole all the hoses ever have been replaced

front sprocket I mean it goes way back in here and it coats the entire thing and it's way down in there so I mean this literally prevents anything from touching your counter shaft sprocket which is really nice it's a little bit takes a little bit longer to take off when you're adjusting your your front sprocket or taking your chain off or something like that but it's definitely definitely worth it and it looks sweet it gives it that closed-off look which is really nice you got a golden chain on here as well it's more of a bronze chain but needs to be cleaned just because it just got it back from the shop let me come back to the back here and we have the fender eliminator obviously there's no fender up there plates move down here it's relocated under the seat down here we have the dual

GP exhaust down here which is really nice sounding it sounds great you can see I mean it is just gutted it is literally nothing in there nothing at all very nice exhaust though sounds great does not sound straight pipes like it doesn't sound trashy it doesn't sound disgusting or like really obnoxiously loud it just has a very very good tone to it and then back here we have this carbon-fiber rear hugger which goes from this side and the rear hugger all the way into this chain guard right here is a carbon-fiber chain guard which is very nice and then you also have this swing arm right here which might look a little bit different to you guys than normal because normally there's a huge hole in this thing and you got a bunch of little other you know brackets and stuff like that on it from the stock swing arm this is not the stock swing arm this is a GP swing arm so this entire swing arm has been fabricated and it's a custom aftermarket GP swing arm which looks really nice it's very sturdy very stable very solid and it just adds such a nice look to the back of the bike without having that big hole right in the middle of the swing arm right there I mean it just looks really really cool there's a bunch of people that have asked me like what looks different about my bike you know other than all the carbon fiber and the gold accents and everything and that's the biggest thing is people don't notice that that's a closed swing arm and it's a GP swing arm and once I tell them at that like oh that's exactly what it is because the GP swing arm just adds that really nice touch to it so we have the integrated smoked tail light which I'll show you here so obviously it has some dirt on it but it's smoked and there's no turn signals obviously hanging off of it and I'll turn on really quick for you so you can see that's what it looks like then if you turn the turn signal on it has the sequential integrated turn signals which look really nice so then you got your high beams but can't see those until you turn the bike on so I got that and then like I said it has the power commander five I have the OEM rear seat cow on it which looks nice I really like this little like pad kind of look to it it's not just all plastic but that looks really nice it has new Iridium spark plugs it has the e xup delete like the X up delete and then it has graves velocity stacks under the tank again which I'm not going to obviously take the tank off to show you but it has graves velocity stacks it just got used me for mess here just got oil filter new AMSOIL new oil or new antifreeze new coolant new spark plugs new stator gasket covers and all that good stuff so that is it for my walk-around guys there is a absolute crap ton of stuff and honestly I probably forgot something I couldn't tell you what it was but I probably forgot something and I have a nice blue hose up here for my front brake fluid which is nice but got all these Brembo mounts for your for your brakes and down here again for this brake you have a Brembo mount right there which is nice I believe honestly also I believe that suspension spring is aftermarket as well and it's it's a different suspension setting then it comes stock because my bike feels different than everybody else is with suspension so I think that's been adjusted and it's not stock but I can't say that for sure so I'm not including that into my definite list but anyway guys that seems like it's it other than that I get asked a lot of time what uh tires I run I run the sport max Road smart twos I love these tires I absolutely love these tires it's the sport max Road smart - well that is my r1 that is my bike I know this is a really long video but y'all wanted to see all the mods so I gave you a video of the mods but it's a very very very clean bike down you got the gold adjustments on the calipers there as well just really really clean not a scratch on the thing really at all other than just like you know like little parts of the decal missing like right there but that's literally it there's no scratches on it or anything like that just very very clean bike so hopefully you guys enjoyed this video and I will talk to you later adios guys", "7FSX4gpKrjE": "this is my R 1 2012 when I put in the first gear it makes a big loud noise it only doesn't it when you put in first gear second gear third gear all the gears

exhaust frame sliders rhizoma grips and our end got a shorter a short front brake oil reservoir model little clock there does I like to see the time it's weird whenever you ride a bike it always seems like you're in a rush so I like the time I've got flush turn signals I got these bulbs off eBay figured I'd try them they were 15 bucks and they've been holding up pretty good 100 watt give out a real nice color to super bright so see how long these will last me I do plan on getting an HID kit but I figure I'll try swapping out the bulbs first still waiting on a tinted double bubble windscreen hasn't come in yet put the tank grips to those things make a world of a difference at the seat cover so makes it into a single seat color was a pretty good match I got it painted so I was kind of worried about the color not matching but it actually was pretty much a dead-on Thunder Eliminator integrated turn signals so yeah 14,000 miles still looks new we've got a little blue hinted hint to them a pretty good pretty nice color for the most part also swap these out with white LEDs probably in the camera but the COC exhaust isn't as loud as what you would expect it to be it does give out a real nice deep tone rumbling noise but it's not loud which is a good thing for people who don't want to loud bike and it's a bad thing for people who do the one thing it does do though is it does give a very enormous performance boost with the K&N filter that I got on here it was almost a night and day difference so the other performance thing I've done was I went with a graves velocity stack and I've done the smog block off pins which I'll have another video too on not really how to do it but it was showing you afterward it was a little bit of a pain to do but yeah if you're looking for sound if you want your bike to scream don't go with this exhaust if you want it to sounds decent and give a nice power boost and don't definitely go with it I'm happy with it I also went ahead and bought a shorty off eBay that thing screams but it takes away a lot of power like your bike becomes a slug for that thing on there but it does scream so anyway thanks for watching and if you guys have any questions go ahead and post but", "EnMiN6y4rAs": "all right I just wanted to make a pretty fast basic tutorial on 2008 yamaha r1 it's the XC model which usually would have no relevance except when it comes to clutch did purchase the OEM clutch which people have said in many forums happens to be a very good clutch and it is let's see if you can get the part number here it's not going to play nice well either way I'll just fits a 4 c8 w 0 0 1 G 0 0 that's the factory genuine Yamaha clutch plate kit for the O 708 and also the o6 limited edition and it can be able to confusing because it does come with extra clutch plates different sizes it kind of throws you off because all you need really is thick it's eight and so you end up with three extra and you kind of start wondering what's going on so unless you've done this before what I have to tell you is probably save some time and some headache first off with the XC model it has no it has no marker uh anywhere on the clutch boss basket anything there's no marker so meaning that if you pull your pressure plate here and you don't mark it anywhere you know when it's on and you don't go to like let's say a marker and wipe the oil off it and mark it and mark it up here on the actual top of this clutch basket part so you can know exactly where it was on before because what I found out the hard way is that there's little shims inside I don't know if you can see the Lighting's pretty bad but inside a couple of these there's these shims I thought they were just like a washer but they're basically just a shim yes for an expensive scam it has some hard time here see if I can hold it focus on a little here so there's these little shims and then on mine there was only four and as you can see there are six holes and so I thought hmm somebody dropped two of them and didn't bother replacing them which isn't the case I found out later that they are to help basically keep your your pressure plate is as straight as possible rather than you know a little pushing up higher or lower putting pressure on the equal circumference of the plates is key and that's why those are there so if you're not dumb like me you would have already marked your pressure plate while it was still attached before you unhooked it you would have also marked which spacer was in which slot luckily for me I'm able to look in and kind of see scratch marks where I know that there was a spring pressing against it versus a spacer since it absorbs the springs harsh edge so smooth versus a rough swirl mark so I can tell which ones where but the problem is basically it doesn't even matter since I didn't mark it I assumed that it was pre marked and I didn't need to worry about it so the best practice is regardless market and you'll save yourself a headache also one thing you need to know is if you do have the XC model all the clutch metal plates these guys are all the same size in the kit you get all three you get one very thinner one and then two thicker ones this is off my old one and on the XC models only you use all the same size clutch plates the the look that the I'll think of that seconds the ones that the pads will be the same either or regardless of the model that so just remember that if you have the XC model you're going to need to remember that as you can see on this one hopefully there's a ring around it toward the the actual teeth and that is because this would have been the first clutch spring to actually go clear in the back after that very first sorry it's been a long night I want to call it a clutch plate but I think that's what these are friction plate there we go sorry about that as a brand part so the thinner half it's like half the half the thickness this way of the regular ones that really skinny one goes in the first before anything else then you have two metal small thin rings they're kind of like a kind of like a big washer kind of but they there's some kind of like a spacer and the flat one will go on first and then there's one that's got a an angle to it a slight angle it's noticeable and the angle part faces you and that's how you can see that this clutch plate here has that indent is from that the the pointy part is the part that's rubbing up against this also the the factory edge is I guess what people call it goes you put it in facing you whereas the smoother kind of rounded edge goes in towards the motor for those that don't know so that's the basics on that I believe that's everything I was going to mention the the kit comes with these Springs but I don't know why they have this white paint on them and I don't know why I kind of bothers me the trickiest part that everybody complains about would be this part in the case right here the these these have teeth on them just on that one side and this shaft here it's actually starts there that it hooks up to your actual clutch mechanism it's what spins it up and if you can see let's drag it to focus its its spins inside it's like a it's like a gear and it moves this upwards and downwards depending on if you're pulling the clutch or not and that's what actually pushes the pressure plate or pulls it out to disengage and engage the clutch and so this goes on before the the pressure plate and it's it's going to be a little bit tricky because you kinda have to eyeball it and feel it and then you also need to understand that this has an arrow on it pretty visible maybe not so much right now because it's hard to focus which is one hand but it's just right there right at the bottom of the point to it I set it down here it's just right here there's an arrow it's pretty visible that arrow needs to align with there's a very lot more difficult to see but it's still pretty visible there's a little dot right in the middle of this circle by the end of the installation when everything's said and done those should be aligned a lot of the times people start with them aligned and then when they twist it to engage they're off by 20 or so degrees and then they complain a loose loose lever basically they have to push all the way in just to disengage and engage the clutch so that's going to be some interesting times one other thing I wanted to go over was I wrecked my bike laid it down and I got these vortex rear sets and pretty much saved my whole bike besides one fairing that this bolt here let's see touched and push against the plastic and actually put a hole in it but I've already actually fixed it and painted it if you go to color right com they have paint that matches exactly it's pretty incredible I think it's like 80 bucks and you can do like one or two panels that aren't necessarily too large it comes with clear code everything you need the other thing too is I thought show you vortex has a new oil filter and I thought it's really awesome they got it wrapped and sealed and also the nut which I've yet to see a motorcycle oil filter have that nut which is the exact same size as the oil nut for the release so you don't have to change your your socket or wrench with mine the headers are really close so it's easier to use a wrench for me but these filters are really convenient and I like that they're wraps so that you know nothing's in them dust or anything and the ease ability of that nut is very awesome with the rear sets it's it's convenient that I can order just the parts that I need the part that I broke will actually nothing even broke it just wore down about an inch or so not sure if I have those laying right here or not but you can order just the foot rest the lever which is all I ordered and I think it was like $30 rear sets are like four to four fifty if you look up a stock rear set from the factory which are really super cheap quality they're almost the same price I believe it's like 150 or so stock so it's almost worth it just to pay a little extra if that's the case because that'll be a very good investment and as far as I'm making a huge risk I've always used the llaman lube and I know that some people will criticize that but it's the fifteen W fifty there we go and after reading a lot people are using the mobile 110 to be 40 I'm going to use it I'm a little bit worried because I live in Utah where it gets really hot in the summer but we get snow and it gets to below freezing I'm just a little bit worried about that I appreciate anybody's opinion that may live in the same climate I know that oil is kind of a sensitive subject that everybody's got their own opinion anything would be great for me I'm kind of a little nervous but I'm going to go for it and as far as all that goes I think that's it i hope that that covers everything these just be tightened the springs once this the place on 7.2 foot-pounds of torque don't guess use a an actual torque wrench because you do not want to guess with those that's very specific you will shorten the life of your clutch if you don't I believe the guy actually did an oil change and I think it holds just a little over three quarts when all said and done I hope that this will help you guys save some time and effort this is the the vortex peg that I ordered it's just nice you just replaces the opt buy a whole new set very convenient but as far as it's saving majority of my bike I'm impressed it's the frames intact didn't even get any corners of my seat didn't even get the rear passenger peg the frame I mean completely I'm completely satisfied hopefully I'm trying to think really quick if that covered everything the main important thing is this very last piece to go in is specific it'll tell you pretty much on the the plastic and it looks when it's not oiled up which mine is it's been in a bag for a few days since I've been trying to figure this out you really only need it in for a half hour to an hour that I didn't mean to leave it in that long but if these were dry you you'd clearly see the difference in the little of the the actual grabbing parts the the oh I don't know what you want to call them pads or what not so it's kind of easy to tell plus the the actual metal piece is kind of like green or color so that's the only major thing to remember there and if you do not have the XC model there should be a dot anywhere all along the the ridge on the clutch boss it would be let's see if I can get in here I am not good at the cameras so bear with me here I just want to try to get you guys as much info as I can in a short amount of time it's not really working out too good but as you might see there's these little dots see where I'm at here right here on every single one there's these little dots that's what it will look like but only on one of them and then that's what you would align if you had a mark which I believe this one it's supposed to be technically the circle you would align it with the mark but saves bet is like I said before you get too happy ripping apart the clutch take your time mark it fit you know keep track of where your shims are and you will be good to go I still recommend everyone that you pull out place facedown basically to ensure that if you lose track of something you can look back and say okay I pulled this one out first this or that second that's just a fail proof way of going about it I so far think this kit is is pretty pretty good it came with its own gasket so I was pretty happy about that if you guys have any questions please ask I will try my best to get back to you as fast as possible and leave comments on what you think about the choice of oil that I made thanks guys", "xza0x_uu1Ic": "welcome to another edition of arwen videos calm today we're going to show you how to change your front brake pads you need a couple of very basic tools to do this job set appliers you can even use the pliers that are in your tool kit I've got a couple pair here just for making getting the cotter pins out a little bit easier we're going to place our stock OEM pads with a DP sport double H pad you're going to want to go with these double H pads whether it's eb c DP SBS whoever you use double h very important i want to stick with that we're going to start by pulling out two cotter pins here and here next we're going to pull out the keeper pin here take your needlenose pliers just reach in give it a little bit of a pull there it'll come out like that grab it pull that out of there next when I take this out of here this this will fall out sometimes or pop out pull that out of there very important that goes back in the same way it came out can't go in any other way goes in just like that next we'll reach in pull out our brake pads one at a time some time to give them a little wiggle they'll come right out a little tip well it's about halfway out take and press on that pad that'll push the brake caliper Pistons back in a little bit so when you push your new pads in they'll slide in a little bit easier so there's one pad come out about half way out and then just kind of give it a wiggle back and forth and that will help push those brake caliper Pistons in pull that guy out of there okay so we've removed the pad you want to replace your brake pads when they get down to two millimeters of pad life left here we're going to measure with some calipers we are right at two millimeters these are wearing a little odd we're a little less on this side then we are on this side we're not quite to that we're point but we're replacing the pads anyway to put an upgrade with the DP pads you'll see the difference so again we're replacing the stop pad with an aftermarket DP pad DP is the the brand you're going to notice right away that these stop a lot better than the OEM pads even though the OEMs work very well these are phenomenal in initial bite and initial grab these are a high performance pad good for everyday use track riding racing a lot of people really think these work too well I like a brake that with just two fingers it's going to stop and work well this is this is that pad they do an exceptional job so for installation of these we're just simply going to take them slide them back in you may have to do a little wiggling to get them in there that one we need just fine other side it's a little tighter so we may have to take a screwdriver be very careful not to gouge your brake rotor but take a screwdriver in here and just pry those Pistons back just a hair more again being careful not to gouge your rotor just take it slide it all the way through and then pull back on it just a little bit that's going to push those Pistons in some more so you can get your brake pads to drop right into place get back of the pad obviously the braking surface of the pad the braking the braking surface of the pad obviously is going to run on the rotor want to make sure we get that correct just kind of slide in here with a little bit of work okay replacing the spring is going to be the next part that we do we're going to slide this in here and you be careful when you put this in place your pads may try to push out the front of the caliper so just kind of hold hold it with your finger there put the spring in place you're going to take your PIN some people like to wipe those down coat these with grease I don't like to put grease on any part of a braid component as it gets hot and may get on your road race or your pads so I'll just kind of clean it clean a little bit with a rag or just wipe it with my fingers I'm going to take these holes make sure they're pointing away from the caliper so when you put it in you can put the cotter pins back in sort of taking the slide this guy in again a little bit of a wiggle catch the backside of the spring so we basically want this this rod is going to go right through the backside of the spring here so make sure you catch that if you don't you need to you need to try again slide it in there catch take your finger on the back of the caliper press the back pad press it up push that in a little bit a little bit of a wiggle she slides right in take your keeper pins or your cotter pins and put them into place feel good solid grab same thing for the other side that is why we had those holes lined up so we can get those back into place there and we're done we're going to do the other side the same way when we're finished we're going to come up to the hand the lever pump that lever a few times make sure they're grabbing and then take a slow initial test ride to make sure they work so that's it for replacing the brake pads very simple procedure you can do it yourself don't have to go somewhere and pay somebody to do that it literally takes five minutes of your time not very difficult you want to go easy for the first 50 to 100 miles braking on these so they meet in properly don't go out there and get on the brakes hard do some gentle braking for 50 or 100 miles until they break in they will grab initially quite well over the OEMs but if you want to break them into your this procedure is going to be the same for most are ones 98 through 2006 going to be a very similar pad pin and keeper on the oh seven through 2012 you've got a six piston caliper so you've got two here and another at the bottom there'll be two pins to do so there's a very similar procedure for all our ones no reason you can't do this at home don't forget when you're done replacing the pads come up here pump that break a couple of times before you go ride because when you push these Pistons in your going to lose some pressure up here at the lever so don't forget before you go ride just pump those pump the brakes back up and that's a wrap on replacing the brake pads on your r1 thanks for joining us on our one videos comm don't forget to Like and subscribe if you have any

r1 it's kind of nice because the old one is going to change without their brand new release Allen Tino Rossi and Jorge Lorenzo that the massive release for the new yamaha r1 and that should be rather interesting to see how that fares next year would refer into me entering into world superbikes ago as well as BS being other domestic races you'd think so with so much development going into the pocket rockets but when this one with the nice big untied monster their previous 1 i've done it that's all one was Tommy Hill when he became champion on their semi yamaha r1 I'm just doing these because is it doing Josh bricks and Tommy Bridewell because I really like the livery so I just thought to give you a little quick update on what I'm up to but all the news as well obviously we've got mid-cycle live over there because I'll be at home in the studio working on this and the Tommy Bridewell paintings and hopefully all the stuff in the future and we have cold fogarty though don't we we've had Guy Martin on the television and now it's a little bit foggy in the jungle and it could be foggy to win which would be rather interesting and i'm a celebrity get me out of here so here's a shot of the Carl Fogarty commissioned it's a picture that Karl actually commissioned me to do and 10th anniversary of his retirement from World Superbikes been the greatest ever World Superbike rider and he signed all the pictures so possible foggy Christmas present ideas for foggy funds there anyway i hope you like this little shot of the from suspension in the front wheel as I'm detailing up on

breakdown of the procedure now take the rear seat off you're going to proceed you take this top bolt off allen key right here on the side as well you took this one here and the one on the other side and then so just pretty much pulled it pull the panel it's got some type so be careful with those not to break them and then it's going to have another set of screws right here on the side and one on the other side and what I found is the easiest to do is also take this rear bolt off on this on the tank and not sure if you could see it but it goes right straight through here you just pull that then you're going to hit go ahead proceed and lift the tank up and this is pretty pretty simple just check these out of screws on the on the air box off do not mess with the small allen keys allen key spears those are for the injectors and the filter is has some tabs that kind of hold it in place so you're just going to have to either pull really hard or try and pry it but I would not I would not try and pry it now just pull with your you know with your hands that's pretty much break down reverse procedure to get everything back online alright well have fun Roger out", "K35l3yAf2r4": "what up guys huh today I'm gonna bring you some unboxing and show you what I ordered for my project 2015 Yamaha r1 this is I believe the grills that goes on the radiator and the oil cooler actually got them from eBay and this one came from China so it took like ten days to get here but this is the has like a different color so I'm going to show you the inside of it and it was pretty cheap thing was we're gonna see hopefully is not really cheap material ten days to get here roughly and hopefully getting the bike as you can see it's not bad either for the camera angle mesh okay so it's yeah what's aluminum as you can see this is aluminum no actually all of its aluminum so this aluminum and in the mesh so as you can see it's looks pretty cool that's our blue anodized blue this for the oil cooler goes on the bottom of the bike comes with secured it super dumb the bottom piece and the radiator one ah it was gonna be something way way cheaper and uglier but me look legit this is the front piece this is for the radiator as you can see and this is the back piece some holding bracket and also it has the one for the top for the radiator as you can see that's about it so this is the the bottom for the oil cooler and the top for the radiator I think it's gonna really stick on the bike and I'm gonna do some videos shortly about installing all the parts on the bike and show you step by step what I'm gonna do to the bike and get it done so yeah this is a quick adjust video unboxing and show you what the products that I'm getting from from the bike build that I'm doing and like I said this is from ebay and pay like $26 yeah it took like ten days to get here but I mean it's worth it because I was gonna buy some other ones probably like double the money I think they were like 80 and they were used once so I think this will give give the bike another and will look sexier so yeah thanks for watching leave a comment subscribe like the video share it whatever and as always I'll be seeing you next one", "70mtyVfpkjU": "what's up guys welcome to supercars of London and the Sunday of our Barbados adventure and we're here at Bushy Park for the festival of speed this is a huge event for

is so far away we've got Harley Davidsons away and you can still hear it so 2013 car meaning it still screams how everyone wants f1 cars to sound now [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] honestly a motorbike can't keep up with this car so it has no chance he can't break anywhere near as light as me or travel through the corners as quick as I can but are we gonna try and make it fun we're gonna try and do a bit of a drag race and you know see how it goes [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I do not think I have witnessed anything cooler at a Motor Show than that Lewis Hamilton versus a thousand cc Superbike racing around it was impressive to see just how fast that superb I was but also not only the sound for the speed of the Formula One car this is so rare that I'm able to upload this sort of video to YouTube I've been to the Monaco f1 I've been to the ever W f1 and not being able to post any car content from that event whereas here the Barbados Festival speed this is something really really special and I'm so glad that I'm able to film this for you guys because that sounded insane I just hope that my microphone has picked up all of the sound cos it was pretty epic and now I'm gonna head back up here where it's a little bit breezy a little bit more windy which is nice on the face because it is around 35 degrees that pivots ipsa following through in seconds with we will see", "raJsl1KXon0": "what our folks how you doing about the kilo kid coming back at you once again with another video this time as you can see most of the Girl Scout cookies are gone they're actually over here what I'm doing is uh treating all the plants with a neem oil spray it's a meme it's neem oil is comes from the neem oil seed in India they smash it down into oil and it's really good to prevent pests bugs spider mites you know any other leaf eating insect or you know but uh you just spray it over over the plans definitely make sure that you get the other side where all those spider mites like to build their home but basically I just you know just trying to get everywhere a bun of the under the leaves and then at the end after that I'll spray the top of the leaves too just to get it all totally saturated but like I said just to just prevent the maintenance for spider mites and other pests I do it about once every two to three weeks and these are nice polish to the leaf as well the top of the leaf without destruct without disturbing the photosynthesis process I guess you call it of the leaf so it's good for the leaf and also like I said it polishes the the leaf so it definitely makes them look good but it is safe percent all natural and yeah I do that through the plants every two to three weeks and just to give them a little preventive maintenance to give them some to fight those spider mites that you know we can see we can't seem to get rid of sometimes looks like you got a bug in there or get it look at it look at this guy mom I don't know if he's a good bug or a bad bug it doesn't look like it cares too much for the neem oil we gave a little spray if anybody knows what kind of bug that is [ __ ] let me know well yeah he's not gonna make it I'm gonna take him out if he's a good or bad but not really sure but better safe than sorry my friend sorry to do it to you but you got to go on yeah so this is a monkey like you once again showing what we do for the past preventive maintenance neem oil water and a touch of dish water soap just to better mix the oil and water I guess I'm not really sure I guess I don't know the science term for it is but the dishwashers just look dishwater soap is for to combine the oil and the water that's it that's what we do that's how we do it Makakilo key all right", "UhyrQ7uypwo": "starter motors fixed and now the bike is making a whirring noise and when I wrote it was knocking and it felt like maybe some of the cylinders are not firing I check the spark plugs and they're all sparking so there must be something else going on I know that high-pitched whirring or not a hiss it's kind of a scraping his butt", "SevKlr-pEv0": "another minivan can you believe it's pre-owned and look at the interior it's even got its not the right car is it by any renowned car in exchange it within three days nice de canna dealerships believe in nice", "D8T_UxQX-Kk": "all right our one quick back with second half of the clutch replace me so it's on it took a long time cuz you got to do these zigzag like five kliks out of time so I could go in evenly cuz it's aluminum you don't want to strip it so I know I didn't show how to put it on but I'm gonna tell you now this was the wire so this one is the small one as you can see the other ones are larger see the other ones are larger the lighting is kind of bad in here but anyway this one goes in purse then a steel plate then after the steel plate you put the wire I'm gonna show you guys the wire now you gotta take that out too and get a new one it comes with the kit see the wire see it you wrap that around and you put it into two little holes so I can secure it and make sure it's secured go around turn it around and make sure secure seat it well then you put another fiber one of these and then a ceiling then a fiber then a steely at the end you should have a fiber left before you put this cover on if you don't have a fiber at the end you stack them up wrong then you tighten this up you put the springs and you tighten it up just finger it for your fingers zigzag like you do a car wheel until you get it tight and then with the ratchet you go like five clicks five clicks five clicks five clicks like that it takes a long time but finally you get a seated you're supposed to torque it I think is seven and a half pounds I have a torque wrench but I usually just do it by feel and I've been pretty good with that so I just make sure that is snug but the torque spec is seven and a half pounds and now I'm gonna put the the hull you can see it there and it's gonna take me some time so I'm gonna come back with a third part to the video and I'll I'll be right back after the hub is installed cuz you got to put the gasket as well which is a brand new gasket see it make sure it's a brand new gasket and make sure you clean the hub cuz you don't you want it to sit well clean it as best as possible I see that there's like a little crack there as you can see it I don't know where that came from but lucky it sits on top so it's not gonna be a problem alright I'll be right back", "4eSRU8t5Sss": "oh and um okay so this is an even know friday so right now at the moment and then after i'll be uploading it so you can see it fresh okay give it a the engine sound let me just um get it going this all by the way it has the LED a blue night light so people looks you know so people looks cool writing at night and it's it's a really beautiful bike man it's not no piece of  really really good bike so they just people that wants to take advantage when I went in and bought this bike I didn't lowball the guy acts 7,500 and but um you're not getting a piece of all right just need you to understand this is not no piece of that you're getting you can tell do tell well taken care of by okay all right you can hear you can hear  well taken care of by alright because this bike literally for the rest of your life is a fantastic life all right and it's my loss and is your game give it a little red alright so now you understand what is not a piece of bye hey you get in a very well maintained very low mileage by hold on let me show you the mileage you know what I'll rev it again one more time not too much ok you and by the way this is not carburetor this is feeling jected okay", "aTshAEYVAww": "okay this is a sitteth just random panels off a no 708 our one of our office step no there are offer repairable right off they're not perfect they've got scratch marks on them the fear death earring has got a couple of cracks in it scrub mark D but there's nothing wrong of them there are all good panels I just need to be washed cleaned up that's the exhaust shields that's your panels underneath your handlebars inside your feelings that's underneath the tailpiece that's a crime as you can see but it does have a rub mark just there in a couple of rub marks there where they just been rubbing sitting in the bloody shed it's a tile unit that does have rub marks there on the side and a rub mark there - that must have been from a crash but as you can see it's let's just rub the paint that's all and that then the bottom there that's a scrub mark there on that part of that belly the my guard is faded and it's got a scratch mark just the flip the seat that's the seat off the back that's good just needs clean and the reaming takes the air and takes the little bracket off the end is broken which is a shame same as that one it's just broken knee", "r6GZLevfWvs": "[Music] [Music] I'm looking at the star one - she's so pretty but I think what's come on I think what's gonna end up happening with this bike because I just like the FCR I kind of retired it once I got another 600 right if the two are ones come find something really dope I don't think I'll be riding that one anymore for me my fun bikes ours are always gonna be the 600 those are gonna be what I want to spend the most time on I have a most enjoyable bike in the r6 the r6 is going to be like the crown jewel when I ride all the time look at that reflection that she looked I cuz he kinda [ __ ] little wrong look how good it looks though it's an old [ __ ] but nice Wow so I think I'm gonna be working in the garage that I wanted to get out and ride go ahead and knock out that [ __ ] that's in the garage so yeah we'll be in the garage working look at all these skid marks [ __ ] he's really going crazy [Music] this because I gave up on these for a while thank you you ever do one huh just I'm not too far from home let's just flash back to the crib okay so let's get a little bit more in depth with this r1 I've got all the plastics it's got the real nice flush mounts two brothers exhaust let me show you the tragedy that is a fire carcass bike the cause of the fire supposedly this is leaking that's what supposedly started the fire obviously with everything destroyed here can I use this but luckily I have everything on that r1 so here we go this was the point of hail everything started from here and it went crazy so because everything is destroyed here I have a good example here that's not destroyed Jesus I'm not gonna lie I'm very very nervous about this because you know the extent of the damage can be far more than my capabilities but I'm definitely gonna give it a shot and it's scary to take a couple thousand dollar shot at something but you know we might have success once I've taken all the pictures that need to take this whole like exposed wire harnesses harness routes where everything goes then I'm gonna start cleaning this up now I have the confidence to take pieces out that are burnt so that I can get down to the core and expect inspect everything that I need to and know what's good and we can rock from there all right so that you can see from completely damage to not damage you see everything that's not burnt in here compared to that one so yeah that's pretty bad but I mean I have a fuel pump these are on eBay for like 150 hundred sixty bucks so you know if we do need another one for this tank later on I always want to have like everything ready to go I'll just have a spare here's I'm gonna be taking the detailed pictures from I'm gonna take some from this spot right here so that we can see how everything looks completely plugged up we'll see what is here and what will be missing I'm seeing where lines run off of stuff which direction they run and then what I'll do is I'll just literally cross-reference them I'll have them memorized by the time I really get into tearing this down damn shame this Power Commander got fade it was something tied into it or something melted - it looks like something melted - it [ __ ] melted - it park commander like brand-new caching me out so leader bike I don't need a damn her commander anyway for the breakdown let me put this thing over here and the cut we're gonna have to blow this [ __ ] out over here because there's a lot [ __ ] but I do not want in my house I've been cleaning this thing for 20 minutes compressing the [ __ ] out of it and I mean it feel quite a lot of powder that's flying out this [ __ ] once I get this [ __ ] done and it starts riding I I can almost guarantee that I'm gonna be looking like a goddamn chemtrail flying down the highway I might get a pressure washer and stop blasting some of the lower extremity that's all that powder that's just caked on probably some of the fuel was dropping there that Jim McKnight and now it's just like a an extinguisher pink under that [ __ ] so I'm gonna keep chugging away at it before they go fly by quickly I got through with the majority of the cleaning that I want to do today the conclusion that I'm coming to and this is probably gonna be for the better I'm going to have to take the frame off and the motor just it has to be done I feel like this is going to give us the best opportunity to clean everything and remove the stuff that needs to be removed a lot of effort is going to go into this and I mean why not right those of you that really wanted some action you got it now here's the cool part though right I mean at least the bike has everything on it so when I'm done and put it back together it's done it's not like I need to buy anything else this is this is all that's needed interesting so we're at the point of the vlog we're gonna end it and I'm out that's the end of this experience I'll check out in another one a little bit of assistance I see I see you so I've torn out absolutely everything that is damaged I didn't really mean the dotage for today because I'm trying to pace myself the majority of this stuff right here is all the vacuum lines to the injectors that's each of them are like that most of that stuff was Torah on this the cover looks bad but the actual line is still good I'm okay with that all of the injectors are fine none of those melted which gives me hope that just means that the fire wasn't on long this is the only sensor so far that I've been after in place water pump is quite melted but I'm not trusting in what parts of the house this is that's gonna be good it looks bad it's good to still use this those who believe the timing cover say I believe this is the back brake so all of these are good they just had some crispy bits on and I took them off no problem all right temp sensor that was destroyed and gone it had the cap on it actually right here but my are six that was taken off for the race by God I don't know why so this can run without it but I'm gonna put it on I want it to I want it to operate all the way stock the whole harness is lifted and ready to get off this damn bike really all the crispy bits are gone once I lifted this this heat mat up everything started to look a ton better this goes to the starter you can see the top of it right here that's the starter right get the hell out of the way that is the starter right there well I'm filming this on the phone because I absolutely was over it and I was about to go inside but then when the Sun came out I got the motivation to keep it cracking so GoPro and everything's inside but we're we're looking sadly when I tear the harness off and put the new one on it's really just gonna be clicking everything together so I was going to I think the last clip I filmed I was saying how I was about to drop the motor out and I really was but once I tore all that stuff off and it doesn't look as bad as I once thought I may be okay without tearing the motor out this is gonna take a little bit of focus to to get those vacuum lines back on there and rowdy dude everything is looking up I will be really excited like really really really excited if all of this stuff comes together and all of this equipment is good which it looks like this is just burnt stuff from the field tank if everything comes together and I don't really have to do too much I'm gonna be absolutely excited that we got this bike together I won't be out of the woods until it fires up though so when it fires up probably do a jig this is this is all I'm gonna do today I'm gonna throw away all of this burnt [ __ ] and get the bike back inside the next situation will probably start - tearing that one down this right here I'll show you where it's burns up another one this right here is just a crankcase breather to the airbox again fuel this is yo harness that just clicks on under the gas tank this one is well fuel line goes under the gas tank feel so fuel fuel you'll feel done right when you see those coolant line so we got those those are fine and then this little harness set up right here and these connectors these connectors to the t's these are all the things that go to the fuel rail here's our water pump these are capped off because these are needed I guess but they're on either side you got one right here and you got another one over there they're capped off there's our water pump here's our brake line there's our coolant joint and this is the timing see how all that makes sense now here's our crank the crank case vent Alayna timing brake cool it and then there that's the one that went to under the tank this one goes under the tank alright so that's gonna be it I'm done I'm really done this time yes she still does work", "Lbju1ZfsrBE": "alright guys this is my 2007 Yamaha r1 I took apart the clutch yesterday I went to do a Burnout and as I was releasing the clutch give him orgasm pressing the the front brake the RPMs just went crazy and I let go the entire clutch and it wasn't moving the temperature on the motorcycle went to 254 and instantly pretty much and so I got off of bed turn it off got off of it and I put it on neutral I went back and forth with the bike as it was off and was good however was making this clicking sound then right so then I put it on first gear squeeze the clutch as is off at I looked at up still and it was going back and forth I let go of the clutch and it still went back and forth I was like what the so I took it off and took all this parts off and to find out that most of them are broken our melt excellent there's like bits and pieces look at that you can't focus either ways the majority of them are like this the majority of the ones are in the front not up to the back so when I opened this and took all of them out they're like completely black and they're like really really tar black so I started with though with a brush cleaning it out that most of it I don't know what to clean if I can play with soapy water but I don't want no water get in there so I'm not gonna do that so if you have an input let me know but this this clicking wasn't there before I don't know if it's normal or what it is but if you have any input let me know thank you", "vq_GSIleLYo": "okay all right we're gonna show how I was doing the leak down check the motor first we're gonna line up the number one cylinder at top dead side and now we got our team Marc lined up with the same in the case and the lobes on our cam for number one cylinder are opposite each other and set the leak tester so it's reading at zero or close through at zero and then we're gonna measure leakage and the number one cylinder now we're sitting about 53 I'm gonna rotate the crank 180 line up number two there's the t mark going around pretty close to 180 using the cam little more so I got our lobes almost directly opposite each other we set our tester to zero we're sitting just under 30% leakage here number four next okay it's another 180 line up that T mark again you said our Chester to zero we're sitting just over 50 52 I forgot to show this on number one but all my leakage is out of my intake we'll go back and show number one I got my lobes crack over 180 close close here loaves are opposite each other or just set our tool to zero and we're getting about 34 35 percent leakage and not getting anything out of intake nothing up the exhaust nothing out the bleeder and I don't know about about the coolant lines so we'll go back and show the leakage of number one coming out of the intake back zero so we're getting repeatable close to repeatable 55% leakage and you can hear it all up out of the intake that's it that's how I did it", "3drkcdxoGl0": "hey what's up guys this is a quick video on how to program the shift light as you can see I'm working on the bike it's in my living room right now too cold outside be riding anyway what you do have this turned off hold down here this is one hand hold down the select button and then once you have the select button held down turn the key on keep the select button held down for a few more seconds start blinking use the reset button to change this is the brightness of the display I've got mine set all the way up hit select to select that this is the different shift light options that you have you got this one I like this one it's most noticeable for me you got it to where it'll pulsate like this and then the last one is that it will just come on and stay on I'm going to select this one and hit select and this is where where the shift light will come on I've got mine set to about ten and a half now I'm going to you can change it every five hundred by hitting reset so I'm going to put mine back up at ten and a half select and this is this is when you want the shift light to turn off I've got mine set to I don't know what that is a few hundred right before red line and then I'm going to hit select and then this last one is the brightness of the actual shift light itself I've got that turned all the way up as well hit select and you're done this is a oh three are one I've seen it done this similar way on an r6 I'm not sure about other bikes but this is a oh three or one hopefully should work it should be about the same good luck to you guys", "JnY5TVtuKAI": "it was help you too it's crazy but words comin at you uh would update I'm a bite cuz I got shot grips got the newly was prom and I just installed my passenger footpegs and should see got these gon put onto it so this is my baby she inside

Sam see here I noticed back last year there was a few posts about what maintenance and things like this you do yourself and it kind of surprised me to know that how many people don't do things like oil changes themselves because it really is simple so I thought I'd do is a quick one maybe they'll inspire a few people there's loads of videos already out there on this and you can go do a couple of those as well but maybe putting this online will inspire a few people should we say to go and do it themselves now crack ultimately if it doesn't work just take it to a buddy Gary Jenny way to fix it it's not an issue but the satisfaction you get doing this type of stuff yourself is great you know I highly recommend it so foreign oil change you see I've already got like a full of oil there which has come out the dead are six um it's easy I mean Jackie back up on a pad extent i always put card down on the bottom because you will get oil that leaks at the bottom of this i'll drain it all into this anyway but you'll always find that something comes on the floor you don't on your floor put a bit of card down problem solved newspaper anything like that exactly the same stuff all good stuff that you need not all of this but you obviously need a new oil filter and i use the K&N jobs because they've got these nuts on the top makes it really easy to get on and off and you can get caps that go over the complete top of it for if you don't have an app to begin with but for the extra couple of quid came in every single time this time i'll actually bought myself a new drain pod as well i'm going to compare the length of it i think to the one that's in there as OEM because i'm not convinced that that's long enough but there we go thought that one anyway you're obviously easier for the again for the sake of two or three quid by the good stuff it's only going to help if i go on to you'll need a torque wrench in order to do up the oil filters the correct specs and also the drain plug and then just some nuts basically and i forget the size of my forget the size of this actually on the top of you and my drain plug I can't remember in fact it will be on your anyway but I just need one of these and basically back obviously I've got my set I've got a final as well for draining the oil in and out and some errand keys to take the fairings off so I'm that's going to be the first task I think so I'm going to drop off of earrings that are needed and show you where the oil filter is on this bike which is the r1 on the r6 it's in a different place but your bike will be unique seeing it going to need to look at that but they all look more or less the same which is that black bob there and three the way I'll get the bearings off and then we'll go from there there's the using my phone at the same time yet but that flat blog there is the oil filter or mine which is at the front then underneath you put the drain bolt which is that one there to drink no let off on some bikes you'll find there the oil filter around here as well just check the off spec a bike but I mean in terms of getting that part off you're looking at one two three four and five bolts down a job done and the next task is really to drain your so in order to do that what I do personally is warm the engine up a little bit and mix the old drink quicker make sure it all drops out also if I know I said put it on a paddock stand before but make sure it's on a paddock stand because if the bikes leaning you get oil in the sump tray which doesn't come out you want to make sure it all comes out make sure the bike is like this and it will all fall to the bottom because that's the bottom of the bike effectively that's where it's all going to drain out and when you take the oil filter off as well obviously it's going to be full of oil so it's a bit of a pain in the arse sometimes to try not get it on there the downpipes and things like that but hey-ho next stage for my backup Jim warmth a nice 60 I turned it off about 58 but it'll continue going up for a bit and whether that's too hot or not to be honest I've picked a figure guest and I've also found out that bolt is a 17 mil so it just goes on there to get it off now although those bloody things are hot down so be careful there you go folks once big lot of oil draining out and that's the plug tip as well get some gloves because you don't want that going all over your hands and things and makes a huge load of difference so I'm I've now just gotta wait 45 minutes for that to drain really he's not much else to do I'm not quite sure how hot now they got 60 degrees is fine it was pretty cool there as well folks is the Sun plug so old one new one and the reason I would only one is it's got this magnetic bit on there so all the little filings that come off the engine they all get stuck in the other times the reason you better change royal that magnetic bit they will pick them up and hold them at the bottom of the sumps of they're not going round and round and round the engine they swim as OEM I don't believe is magnetic so I am going to put this one on I think now the thread depth is quite considerably different although to be fair once you take thee they're not so different but that should make a bit of a difference hopefully and all right guys that's been draining 5 10 15 minutes it's still dripping sleeve as it is is fine the next bit then is to get the oil filter off so as example this is how I get on to it and you can see that that is actually quite awkward and that's why those caps that go over the top of it rather than the K&N nuts make it so much more awkward to get that bloody thing off I'm same time at this side of the bike don't break anything how about I take this other panel off as well because the oil itself how do I show this has to come through this gap because it's the only way it fits again just pack it with bit of toilet paper or newspaper some kitchen roll whatever you've got just to stop the oil for I'm going all over the place and that's the best that I've got so far but next stage is I'm going to take that off and obviously I can't keep you running away I'm doing it because hands are going to be busy all right not only took two or so minutes but you can see that's the old oil filter what it looks like they and big gaping hole where it used to be you can also see all this oil running down my paper now which is what I would have got all over the floor and all over my pipes and God knows what else it is a messy job be warned pack as much as you can into that place to stop the oil from going all over the floor and all over your bike trust me use as much as you possibly can how much unless you can see guys but you can see even more packing the toilet paper there I wanted to show you where the oil pit goes how much mess it really does make regardless of what you're trying to do you will make mess just clean it up as best as pop air possible and sabonis the heat from the downward headers will boil all the oil off anyway within 2-3 minutes but i wouldn't recommend starting in any garrett if that's the case but i'm going to get a new fault filter on there really quickly so I'm not tripping any more oil over the place and what would say is when you're fitting a new filter obviously take thee oh can I balance that they're probably not but take this plastic off obviously and just dab a bit of the old oil around the rim you men today say fresh oil but to be honestly it's only a sealant so put some of the old oil around the rim make sure it's nice and wet before you go and tighten it on so I'm going to do that now there you go nice and easy all I've done fed it through the side day I'm just twisted it on hand tight next thing you'll need to do is do it up properly was one of those but you want to talk it to the right settings don't over tighten it whatever you do so I've looked at mine in my Emmanuel and that's got to be set to 70 newton meters and that's where I've got the torque wrench so that's what I'm will be setting it to that's exactly what I'm going to be tightening up to I really can't stress enough guys do not over tighten your air filter oil filter do not over tighten your son plug do not over tighten any bolt on your bike do it to the exact settings that they're recommending the manual just trust the manual don't go I'll tweak it a little bit more a little bit less blah blah blah trust me you'll run into problems later on and I'm just going to fill in this unplug I'll tighten that 234 Newton meters because that's what my torque wrench will talk setting say in the service manual and then it's just a matter of filling it with oil and that's it job done putting it back together and over the map take the time to you know give it a Polish at the bottom like this bit seeing that the other it's the bit so you generally don't clean because you barely ever have your your feelings officer make advantage of it do it clean it look after your pride and joy and that's component part of owning these things the fun of actually doing it yourself and getting some satisfaction and pleasure of the fact that you've done it yourself all right there you go folks tightened up or I talk a new drain bolt in something has just occurred to me folks and nothing major but how much all you put in it again check your service manual you'll find to two different logical it numbers one based on if you're changing the oil filter the other one if you're not this bike holds 3.93 litres when you change the oil filter as well because I've drained that I need to fill it up which I can see my window here fill it to halfway I'll then start it run it a little bit to fill the oil filter and then it'll probably mean topping up again just a game and lower the little tip and also with the cap that comes off hand tight Barry Luce doesn't need to be tight so the door guys there is virtually a a little bit left in there might need to fill that up you can figure I filled it right fish to the top of my window but i'll probably drop down a little bit when i run it for two minutes but what I do want to point out as well okay black back oil is and then look at the color of the oil of just put in clear and that's why you need to change your oil and do it as frequently as you can I put three and a half thousand miles on this since I last oil change and I do it once a year I suspect but um I recommend you do exactly the same your bikol last longer gain hand tight not doing it anyone that starting up give you the automatic cam chain tensioner rattling there that rattled a lot I suspect because there was no oil in it which I hate so I'm going to put the manual I'm not the automatic there we go that oils disappeared already so I'm going to think i'm going to stop it straight away and put some more in as if by magic refilled so let's start the engine again and see what happens this time hopefully nothing because I've actually used the full four liters of oil in this is only meant to take 3.93 hmm interesting just give it a go gone again actually why we are working example of the system but there's all the smoke just burning off the pipes and it is burning a little bit down here as well but again that will take one minutes to burn off that's all fine nothing to worry about I've actually finished the oil change but I don't know whether I'll cut this in the beginning or not but just to recap on what tools we need it so I needed a 17mm socket bit and my new plug that I installed actually required a bigger socket which was a 19 and I needed my big talk wrench to set the torque setting of the drain bolt because my little torque wrench doesn't do it so my oil filter is at 17 my drain plug is at 34 so I needed both talk branches because I've got one that does both settings that's the only reason I've got one just by one that does a 17 and a 34 within that range and you only need one and i did use this one just for pure use because it's a little bit smaller and easier to handle than talk wrench but again you don't need it i had a set for mel allen bolt to take my earrings off again whatever you need i used a rubber mallet just to knock this when I was taking the drain bot out to loosen it that was it again personal preference you don't have to do that just force it by hand if you want or you'll obviously and a oil filter which is now they install and than that you don't need a lot of tools and I did put an extra 100 hundred and fifty milk of spare oil that I had in there just to bring it back up to its limit which as you can see he's now settling lovely jubbly well there you go folks all back together these fairings are a bit pig actually because they got these little clips and things that clip into the right place but a specific that they spike it's not so much you an issue took me a couple extra minutes or so you can see a brand-spanking-new yet they're called a knife now if you look twice have been that oil fill today and I've cleaned all this as well as best as I can and some of this is proper growing on and but that's much cleaner now along with the inside gallstones and things out you can see that all over the floor and its job done and tips again you don't need many tools not in the slightest pack flat with amount of paper and newspaper as you possibly can to limit the mess and things that rolls onto your pipes don't over tighten anything r170 newton-meters oil bit is or oil sump plug is 34 millimeters they're the only two things you really go to take off this bike and a bit of change the oil I've put in a full four liters even though it says it shouldn't take that much but this one clearly does they put in about 4.1 I imagine I talked it up with some other bits of oil that I've got but there's more than enough oil in and I was probably a little over filled actually so might be better off just dumping in the full liters and leave anything like that apart from that I've given it a bit of clean obviously not too much red gleam bless it if you've got any questions or anything all right just give it a go worst comes to worst you wheel it to a garage and they fix it for you not a big deal and provide certainly recommend giving it a go yourself so yeah thoughts questions like subscribe button it's all there and I shall speak to you all soon the latest people I'm a seer Evans grab me traveling all night something so I'm going to smooth the silk you can see the oil dripping down as well still fresh and clean as dell boy would say", "-JbwDZJxl1A": "[Music] all right so we've already removed the lower parent you have any questions on how to do that refer to our oil change video you're going to take off the mid fairing now let me do these bolts right here and a couple of pop rivets in the front so under the nose you've got a couple pop rivets one at the front one at the rear they're actually two at the front but you only need to pop one of them basically that guy and then one at the back there and if you don't know how these work it'll be like that in the bike just press it in with a tool slides right out by hand you don't have to tear those up to remove them you're gonna kind of give it a little little wiggle on the front right here and slide this forward and back until she comes out I'm gonna wiggle it out of there there you go and you've got your turn signal right here to release factory connection just lift pull those apart basically what we're trying to get to is your radiator cap right here that's about all you're gonna need to release that guy we may go a little farther and take off the ramp air intake as well all right we're on the other side of the bike now we'll put our catch pan under the coolant hose there's a drain right here if you can follow that it's ten millimeter or some put this on there crack this guy loose and we let all our coolant drain out of there so we're back on the right side of the bike above the radiator we're going to remove the RAM air intake and the inner cowling right here just to make this job a little easier basically there's going to be another plastic rivet this one actually calls for a screw driver here rather than a popper of it pop that guy out and it's going to fall on the floor on the bottom here there's another folding it just kind of give it a a very gentle twist and those come right out you don't have to manhandle those they are plastic rivets so don't get crazy with them that's going to remove our inner inner there for the tube at the top there's going to be a screw top here and pop rivet on the back side of the tube right here again just press down pops and lift up so there's a pop rivet next another pop rivet right here in the front of the RAM air tube again press it in little shake it come right out very easy don't manhandle those you'll break them right there one more at the back of the RAM air tube here going into the frame notice how this is set up here we've got a heat shield on top of the RAM air tube top there but make sure you put it back the same way so we've popped it gonna give it a little shake right here catch that guy don't forget to put that back that's important so now our ram air tubes going to be loose enough to wiggle out of the way and it's got the wiring harness attached to it here we're just gonna leave that and let it hang no reason to unconnect that just leave it be let it hang there now we've got access to our fill cap on our radiator we still have our coolant drain plug removed over there we're gonna take some distilled water pour it into the radiator fill cap right here to kind of flush this system out a little bit your coolant system holds about 3 quarts of water so I've got a gallon of water here that will be used for something else but this is going to be more than enough to flush the system we've got another fresh gallon of distilled water right here to fill it back up and we're done be sure you're using distilled water not spring water not drinking water not tap water distilled water only so we're going to flush this right now by just taking some water and pour this through until we see it coming out clear on the drain side over here right now you can see we're still a little green probably gonna pour about 1/2 a gallon through this system just to kind of clean it out all right so our water is running clear we're pretty well flushed out we're ready to cap that off and top off our system okay so we're gonna reinstall our our drain bolt making sure that we did not lose our copper crush washer that's on here you'll want to inspect that those are usually pretty good for a couple of uses inspect it make sure it's gonna gonna be fine this one is just fine just slap it back on here so you've got that crank down we're gonna go to the other side of the bike and put in our water wetter and our distilled water all right so we're gonna put water wetter in our cool system today this is to help the bike run cooler which as you are one owners know these things do run pretty hot so this is going to drop our temperature our running and operating temperature on this bike by quite a bit this calls for about an ounce per quart we talked about earlier this cooling system holds about three quarts so we're gonna pour about three ounces of water into the fill cap here on the bottle there's one ounce marker lines it's calling for about three ounces so we're gonna go from call that an ounce ounce ounce we're gonna get them back to that line there for this bottle on this bike you can't overdo this product you'll just be wasting it if you put more than than what it calls for so we a little under that we've got about three and a half ounces that'll be just fine now again we're gonna take our distilled water and pour until it's full should call for about three quarts you want to kind of pour slowly so the bubbles can work their way to the top especially as you get really close to being full okay so we've got this filled up you can see we're an overflow a little bit not a big deal we're to the top of this guy next we're going to go back to the reservoir bottle and drain that and fill that with water as well this is our rear brake reservoir behind this on this bracket is our coolant reservoir we need to get in there and we're gonna drain that and then fill that with some distilled water as well it's kind of tight it's hard to get to in here that's an 8 millimeter hex you just want to loosen this up a bit this is going to get the brake reservoir out of the way so we can get to the fill point on the coolant reservoir there's your little old bolt there turn this out of the way a little bit and now we can get to our coolant reservoir here this is the cap just gonna pull that all the way out of the way there and this particular reservoir is pretty close to dry normally you'll have some coolant in here between the low and the full line this is actually a brake bleeding tool but it'll suck water out of the reservoir in there works very well the other option is is you can just leave this alone there's like 0.26 of a leader in your coolant reservoir it's just an overflow reservoir but when the system gets hot so you can you can either leave this or if you're a racer or somebody that really wants to be thorough you can drain this out and that is empty nothing in there so we're gonna take our funnel get it over the fill and just pour some water in until we get to the fill line on there the full line it doesn't take much at all take our clothes here back down into the reservoir and make sure you get this cap on it in tight alright so we're good there we're going to reinstall our brake reservoir rear brake reservoir bracket by the way if your brake fluid is this color you're going to want to change that we'll be doing an episode soon on bleeding or cleaning out your brake system so look forward to that in the future this definitely needs to be done eight millimeter socket just kind of squeeze it in there okay so with a little bit of fighting we've got that screw back in there on the on the reservoir again it's the brake reservoir bracket that attaches to the coolant reservoir kind of a tight fit you'll have to fight it a little bit if you have big hands good luck crank that down you don't have to get crazy with it don't try to torque it down it's it's going into a plastic housing so don't get too too crazy cranking that down but you can kind of see our water water level level there now see that moving around we're at the full mark you want to be between low and full obviously so there we are we're good to go on the reservoir we're now gonna start the bike up with the radiator fill cap still off the radiator is full we haven't replaced the cap yet we're actually gonna start and run the bike to get the water to go through the system we're going to let it run so it gets up to temperature about a hundred and seventy one hundred and eighty degrees this is going to take a little bit of time while it's sitting in your garage or where you're working on it so just start the bike this will bubble and overflow we'll try to show you that as it gets to that that's okay let it do its thing when you turn the bike off you're going to top the system off so we're going to start the bike and let it run until we get up to temperature [Applause] okay when you get that you know you're hot we're going to top it off we pull this up maybe a good tip for the future don't leave your tools right under the bed either so basically we ran the bike until it got up to temperature thermostat opened we've got some water coming out of the top of the cap we know where it's a temperature we're going to top this off again you can see the water levels drop again don't ever stand in front of this as you saw the water comes out of there and they're really hot obviously they don't stand right there looking in the whole wall and bikes running either way to get scalding for them that's it again for just a second see if that level drops and we're gonna cap it put it back together and we'll be done all right again so we bring the bike to temperature we've topped off our radiator we're gonna reinstall the cap trying to tell us lockdown bikes ready to go back together again it's going to be air intake tube and then the heat shield from under the engine there on top of the engine I should say install that guy right there press kind of help it along another one here at the front like that there this and these took the the rivets that use the Philips head screw here on the back thing don't have to crank those down there just a little touch right there is another one on the underside at the front here you want to be sure you start by plugging in your turn signal there this has to go under the bottom of the nose or I stay on top of the bottom of the nose cone so it's kind of tricky and slide that in slide that in there [Applause] and you get it all lined up should pull back into place a good solid  like that Zuse fasteners back here to pop rivets again up under the nosecone so the pop rivet at the rear and this one's a little tough sometimes better kind it and work it in there you'll know it's secure if it doesn't pull out it's good in good shape there the other side right so we're gonna take our old antifreeze coolant and dispose of it properly now pour it into one of the empty distilled water containers and then take it to any auto parts store or like a Wal Mart where they'll dispose of it for you cleanly all right so for a recap we drained the antifreeze coolant out of a 2004 r1 replaced it with distilled water and water wetter to get the bike to operate cooler we use just water and water wetter it has no antifreeze properties so if you live anywhere where the bike is going to be in freezing temperatures you want to do something with some coolant or some antifreeze here in Texas where we are we don't ride in freezing temperatures it doesn't get that cold here so we can get away with ajust the distilled water and the water wetter it's also approved for racing sore if your CMR a or a wear eraser just filled water and the water letter is is race approved you're going to want to change out your coolant or the water about every couple of years just check to keep an eye on it the reservoir at the back of the bike near the rear shop keep an eye on that keep that topped up and that's a wrap on another how-to video from our one videos dot-com temple like an app or subscribe to our Channel if you haven't already check us out on our website at WWF [Music]", "Xb3jWnG91iE": "and then sometimes it has like zero resistance like like right there no resistance no resistance no resistance and then strong resistance so i'm", "Bt2eYZMlTFI": "summer heat isn't just hard on you as a rider it's also hard on your motorcycles engine make sure your cooling system is in good order by performing a cooling system service I'm going to show you how in this video from the MC garage why change your engine coolant the fluid in your bike's radiator has anti corrosive agents and acid buffers mixed into it they get used up over time plus the stuff just gets dirty so your owner's manual is going to suggest replacing your coolant about once every two years to change your coolant you're just going to need a few very basic supplies you're going to need some fresh coolant a drain pan and a funnel first of all your engine should be cold or at least cool before you crack the radiator cap you don't want to scald yourself also most oh it cool ins are made with ethylene glycol which is poisonous you don't want to get it on your skin you don't want to get on your bike paint and you don't want to let your dog drink it most aftermarket coolant are made with propylene glycol that's non-toxic those coolants are going to be colored blue or pink still don't wanna let your dog drink it alright so at this point you need to remove whatever bodywork is necessary to get to your radiator cap your reservoir tank and the drain bolt on your water pump cover I'm working on my buddy Zacks our one race bike so it's really easy to get the bodywork off on your street bike might be a little more difficult trying to break any tabs next locate the drain bolt on your water pump cover it's usually the bolt that's lowest on the cover and it's going to have a ceiling washer behind it go ahead and crack that sucker loose and the coolants going to come dribbling out then you're going to loosen your radiator cap and the coolant is going to pour out real fast if your reservoir tank has a siphon hose on it or is easy to remove go ahead and drain the old coolant and flush it out with fresh water you don't need to flush your radiator unless you've got a ton of miles on your bike however now is a good time to inspect your radiator hoses your hose clamps and the radiator itself check your radiator hoses to make sure they're in good condition and pliable there shouldn't be any cracks and they shouldn't be stiff also check your hose clamps they should be in good condition and good and tight now is a great time to inspect your radiator look for any damage and if there's any bent cooling pins you can straighten them with a tiny screwdriver or a pick okay so now it's time to refill the system you're going to want to throw a fresh sailing washer on your drain bolt then screw that sucker in and tighten it down most coolants come pre diluted and ready to use however some come as a concentrate that you have to mix yourself in that case it's usually a 50/50 mixture with distilled water it's important to use distilled water so you're not adding any minerals or contaminants to your cooling system pour in fresh coolant to the top of the filler neck then gently rock the bike back and forth help free any trapped air bubbles then start the bike and blip the throttle several times to fully bleed the system check the fluid level one more time and top the radiator off if necessary then fill your reservoir to the full line and you are good to go now it's important to remember that if you ride an air cool bike you didn't need to watch this video but I'm glad you do I hope you'll subscribe leave your comments and share that's it for this installment from the MC garage we'll see you next time you", "ZDYzAvwPyeg": "[Music] we are at Yamaha dealer where our long-term test bike just arrived a brand new 2018 Yamaha YZF r1m so it's a special edition it's a race ready bike I can't wait to get it out let's get started first I have to remove these straps let's bring her to life now oh my god it's always a great joy when you unwrap a new bike it's like Christmas morning when you were a little boy only better oh my God look so I need the moment just to stare at it the finish is a bit changed but it's looking incredible I can wait I can wait to start it and finally write it but first of all we have to remove remove it from this box [Music] you might wonder why an r1 m an r1 m because it's a full spec race machine and with the 2018 updates now you have a Auto bleeper an electronic suspension that is now we find it's with three setups ready to go on track and that's very helpful for writing on track also there's a an anti really this anti-bully system it's a bit soft and it's a it's a it's a bit modified the finish is absolutely superb I love the carbon bearings also it comes with a brushed aluminum tank and also the string arm it's brushed aluminum this is such a nice finish Oh has a pair 1m logo on the wheels these are lighter wheels the one with three pounds less weight to help you with the performance on track [Music] I can see the keys roll over underneath this bag over here hopefully this are the keys one so better started by the batteries unplug so we'll also have to plug the battery let's see what's underneath here have the battery but first I have to remove this place I think in order to get to the battery oh and here's the ABS system maybe you know this bike has a six axis email that helps it with a cornering ABS and the traction control it's also lean sensitive I told you already that it comes with all the specs the Superbike a modern Superbike needs [Music] ah here's the boat for the battery that I have to plug okay so this is very small positive and negative both off this is a small battery who would have thought that a little bike can run with a small battery like this one it's also very lightweight I wouldn't expect that I'll leave this for later now I want to start it so I'll pour some gasoline inside this beautiful finished tank but I have to be very careful with the key is not to scratch it hopefully I will make it let's pour some gas okay baby I'm feeding you whoa and it's coming to life very nice finish with a - I don't know if I have to do something else if it's a special procedure or not but I will start it there with you for a second for giving it a go oh my god is sounding so good listen to this EP for engine roaring to life this is so nice [Music] I was telling you a bit earlier about this all in suspension that now it's improved it's a semi active suspension electronically control and it also features a GPS antenna over here and the magic comes in when you go on track and the bike knows exactly where you are so if you're going towards the corner you're breaking the electronic suspensions knows your position and stiffens up the front end when you're going mid turn when you're turning it releases a bit the front so you can have a lot of feel when entering then on the exit the rear suspension becomes a bit stiffer so it won't squat re exit that's a very cool asset to have an erase bike I can wait to test it on track let's check also what else Yamaha put in this box for us owner's manual there are some electronic parts over here I don't know where this come in but I will have to oh this is the GPS antenna I was telling you about a bit earlier let me show it to you because it's very interesting unit so this one comes fitted over here on the rear pillion cover what else what else I think this is the communication unit for this antenna in fact all these three items are specially put here for the antenna what else we have a bit of plate over here that I don't know where it goes plates mounting plates I think they are for the front and then also small parts that need to be fitted on this like oh and I also have a tool kit nice so I can adjust my spring on the rear I think these are for the spring and also just in case the screwdriver and the key put them back here let's check some more these are the small pairings that come over here in the front side two of them I don't know what's this I have to check it in the manual and this is the seat cover I think it's made out of carbon but has a very slick look the bike becomes a bit more aggressive with this faded so nice Spanish from Yamaha check out how this logo shines and blends in this carbon part it's insane another improvement for the 2018 Yamaha r1m it's this new Auto Blippar that helps a lot this means clutchless shifting up and down you can go throughout the gears and everything happens this is very helpful when riding on track and another very impressive thing that will help you a lot on track it's the new - actually it is not new the menu it's a bit easier to work with in the previous model you would have some issues finding the right setup for you but now everything it's easier you have that many bar over here you can go between the power modes also adjust the traction control the suspensions mode everything it's very easy to reach so I was telling you about the suspension now it comes with three is easy to use modes it's the road are also t1 and t2 t1 it's a bit more designed for slick use on track t2 it's for a software output from the suspension and Road it's only for Road use a test ride will be arriving very soon if you want to know everything or anything about this bike leave us a comment below and we will answer it [Music]", "19IGIodkHn0": "all right so today I'm gonna be doing the over nine and up are one clutch mud to kind of fix the grab eNOS of the stock clutch I've got my new clutch stuff soaking in there I'll put the part numbers and everything in the description I've got a new gasket and this part is optional but I'm also replacing the clutch springs as well so I got all that ready to go and first thing I'm gonna do is I've already loosened the clutch cable there so I'm just gonna go ahead pull this out and down away from the clamp that it's in and whoops a I pull that down off of that clamp and I just got to lift this little piece of metal here [Music] and then slide that up it's very hard to do with one hand all right so I've went ahead and taken my engine cover off and then I'm continuing to go around loosen all this and also I'm gonna take this off so I can see I'm gonna take this little cover off here as well so I can see the alignment on the clutch bracket here when I go to put it back on [Music] okay so I've taken that off and you shouldn't note that there is an arrow here and a little dot there this should line up when you're all done so we just we should note that for when we're putting it back on later otherwise I'm just gonna go ahead and keep taking those nuts out until I've got the cover off and I believe I also have to take this off so I want to make sure that I know how that spring goes back on there [Music] and there's a spread clip on the bottom don't we have to take off I think all right so it took a lot of wiggling once I got that stuff off to get this to finally come loose but it eventually will [Music] be careful of those three dowel pins as well to not lose them [Music] so there we go [Music] probably did not have to take that spring off it seems better so here we are now and then I start taking away unscrewing these a quarter turn at a time for a couple rounds and they'll take them off completely but you want to loosen them evenly when you're first taking them off so that's what I'm gonna start doing there okay now that I've loosen them up a little bit go ahead and take them off come out just like that there is a washer on the inside make sure that those stay right where they're at so I was gonna go ahead and take the other five off and not bore you through that process but they're not under pressure once they come off so you're not gonna fling out it yet hey so now all the clutch springs are off and note that those paint lines are over there and also the 14b is directly up so just to know that as I start taking this off just in case I need that for later also I gotta make sure to not drop those little washers that were in there with the clutch springs [Music] [Music] that's coming out too [Music] and then from here we want to make sure that as we take these out they go back in in the same order so I'm just going to take them out and lay them directly do you and here's where the mud actually begins so what we're gonna do is now that I've got all of those out I'm gonna take the the last friction plate that came out and throw that away so we're gonna get rid of this one that was the last one that came out of the clutch to the far back and then I'm gonna take my new stuff starting with the flat clutch seat so this is just a plain piece of metal that's gonna go on there first then the spring and be careful because the spring is actually angled slightly so you want the spring to curve in towards the middle so kind of like you're looking into a bowl so the the inside edge will be touching that piece of metal the outside edge would be touching the next friction bird the next piece of steel that I believe we'll be putting on after this one so that goes in like that like a cup and then we put in our new one of these all of which sits around the other two things we just put in and then we begin putting this back on in order the way we took them off you remember that last plate last fiber one I believe it's called is smaller than all the rest so when I took them off I had three dots like that so I think this is the only one that is offset from all the other ones so it should look like this when you're all done so now we are done with those put the pressure plate back on make sure to put this back in there before you put this on and again remember those washers are in there so don't drop them so we'll put that back up in there and for me the 14b was facing directly upwards so that's me take a Trier to to get it right [Music] like that okay that wasn't too bad and if you're doing the YEC Springs I'm just gonna take the old Springs off and open up my new pack of Springs and put those on [Music] just like that but for all six so I'm gonna go ahead and turn the camera off while I do that now once you've got them all in place at least then it's time to tighten them down and torque them so I'm going to torque them to 7.2 foot pounds which is about 86 and a half inch pounds which is what I've got a torque wrench set for so I'm just gonna start all right so there I'll sit next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take this old gasket off actually where is that gasp all right so the gaskets actually on my clutch cover still so I'm gonna take this old one off since I got a new one I'm gonna clean all this up real good and also clean these dowel pins as well get them all on the bikes I'd put the new gasket on and then start putting this back together also this thing should be facing towards there the back of the bike let me put it on so that's what I'm gonna do now while the camera is off okay so I've got my new gasket fitted on there cleaned it up a little bit this dowel pin for me he's not coming out of here so I'm just gonna leave it there and try to get this clutch cover back on just put that there facing the back make sure none of the other dowel pins drop off and try to shove this back you he's gonna take a little bit of work so I'm just gonna stop recording while I keep knocking it into place until it's flush and then button to get this back together is a little tricky again but you know if just as when we took it off you want to have it so that this thing doesn't focus very well anymore sometimes so that at its resting point the dot lines up with the arrow and that when you push it over the dot moves to the left then you want to make sure that the spring goes back up first then this bracket and then a little black washer and then the pinch clip so after this is all good I'm gonna go ahead and reattach my clutch cable to it pull that back in place here tighten that back down just for the time being and just see if my clutch actually works at this point okay that's super loose so I'm going to have to and just that a bit to tighten it up so after a lot of back and forth I finally found a position that worked it's not quite lined up on the dot like it was before so hopefully that's okay my tension got a little different but now the now the lever feels good so we will just button it all back up I'm gonna put this cover back on first then I'll put that on I'll put a little lock tight on this bolt and then I'll start it up and see if I broke anything", "bv9poweIOzk": "2009 Yamaha r1 oil change I don't know how many of you have actually seen what's going on here although I know quite a few of you have heard the difficulties in doing this so let's get the first shot the headers they're twisted in an odd peculiar position and they are about six inches from the oil filter itself so let's get a better look at where the filter sits there's the oil filter I have four or so holes in it now trying to loosen it up with a screwdriver and even going through one side and the other you don't have enough leverage with a screwdriver to loosen this filter and when it does start to turn maybe a quarter of an inch as soon as you let your force loose on the screwdriver the filter goes back into its original position I would venture to say I know well at least some of you I know have been able to finally get this filter off by not using a screwdriver but at this point a screwdriver still isn't working for me I have a filter wrench nope didn't do it my various assortment of screwdrivers hammers getting it through pliers nothing let's go to the other side to see how bad the filter is if you look on this side you can barely even see the filter right up and in there from below the headers so now you get an idea of what I'm working with I just picked up this beautiful strap wrench from Sears still not enough won't do it there's not enough room for this strap wrench to even get in there and that's the smallest one that they've got I'm at my wit's end like I posted earlier I don't know what to do anyway that's it", "D5DbabmWdJs": "what's going on everybody so in front of us we have a torn apart 2009 yamaha r6 that needs a coolant replacement it uh should currently have distilled water in it and we've got some engine ice that we're gonna put in there and i'm gonna show you how to do that today [Music] so obviously the first step for this for a normal person if you have like a bike that's not torn apart and wrecked you're going to need to take all your fairings off obviously we're going to skip that step today because uh my bike is torn apart and my fairings are all in pieces so we're just going to go straight into the steps of you've already taken the pharynx off your bike i would reference your owner's manual if you don't know how to do that or watch youtube videos because that's probably easier anyway so now that your fairings are off hypothetically let's move into what we need to do before we get started with the video you are going to need a couple things you're gonna need engine ice or whatever coolant you wish to use you're gonna need some distilled water to flush your system you're gonna need a pan to catch all the crap coming out of your uh out of your engine you're gonna need a pair of gloves this job can get a little dirty you're gonna need a ratchet and you're gonna need a 10 millimeter and an eight millimeter nut and then obviously the rag if you want to clean stuff up so first things first we're gonna need to take the nut off to allow the coolant to drain from the motorcycle if you're watching this video you probably don't know where that is well so i can let you know it's right there you don't see it okay let's zoom in that little guy right there that's the nut we need to take off so grab the wrench that i told you to get grab the eight millimeter uh tip let's get her off be careful coolant will start coming out once you uh take this nut off so you are gonna need something underneath it to catch the coolant [Music] alrighty so it's fun to sit here and wait on this for a while but a way we can speed this up is to take off the cap here to allow more air to go through so we're going to take this cap off now that with that cap off you can see we're getting a lot more coolant flowing through the system it's just going to speed it up so you can get the colon out at a faster rate again that cap located right there so as you can see we're now just dripping from the bottom so we're going to move on to the next step all right so the next step is we're going to remove the reservoir typically if you guys are just doing a regular flush you guys are going to have um coolant left inside this guy with me having wrecked this has spilled out so mine's going to be empty but i'm still going to do it just to show you guys what you're going to need to be doing so you're going to need to grab that 10 millimeter socket and the wrench and we're going to take these bolts off so we can dump this guy out alright so as you can see we just take the little tube out undo the bolts and you're good to go with this we're gonna dump this into the um to the reservoir that we have all right now we're gonna put this right back on now that we've dumped it out and all that's going to be doing is reapplying the nuts that were in there all right guys so i just realized i forgot to mention you are going to need a funnel for this job that's basically just to make it easier to get the distilled water inside of here let's go ahead and move the wheel so we can get it in there easier so what we're going to be doing now is actually flushing the system we're going to be pouring distilled water into here and letting it go all the way through the system it's going to come out where the coolant came earlier [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right guys so i'm going to run distilled water one more time just so you guys can see the color of the liquid coming out of the bottom bolt you can see that the water the liquid that's coming out there is relatively clear so what we're going to do now is re-tighten the bolt here on the bottom we're going to fill the radiator up with distilled water and turn the bike on to the point where the bike's fan turns on and at that point we will turn the bike off unscrew the bolt and then let that uh run out [Music] all right guys so we filled the radiator full of distilled water i would recommend when you're doing that to listen to the bike because it's gonna you're gonna hear that sound change over time when it's filling up so when you hear it getting full i would go ahead and take the uh i would go ahead and take the tube out because you don't want it to like overflow onto you or whatever all right so we've got the radiator full of distilled water we're not going to crank the bike up let it get up the temperature and then we're going to turn it off because at that point the radiator is going to start running and cycle the water through it alrighty guys so we had a slight issue the bike was actually dead the battery was dead from it hasn't been cranked up since it wrecked so with the alarm on i guess the bike just died but we've got the bike charged up now so now we're going to turn it on and let it stay on until it heats up and the radiator turns on so it starts cycling the fans [Music] alright guys so at this point we just turned the bike off keep in mind you can't unscrew the holes right now because everything that comes out of this bike along with the radiator cap and the nut are going to be hot as hell so let your bike cool off for a minute and then once it cools off we're going to be taking the screw out again going to take the radiator cap off and let all of that distilled water drain through the system you guys ever have that moment where you're like super impatient yeah that's look at the steam coming off of that yeah guys i would definitely recommend when you're doing this make sure you do wait longer i've only waited probably 10 minutes and this water is still crazy hot so just be careful with it but we can do i mean it's coming out pretty well and grab a towel screw the radiator off right your cap off and get it draining and we're just going to let this drain out you can see the water is still a little bit green and that's because we let it cycle through the system all right guys so as you can see we still got a lot of water coming out of the bottom what i went ahead and did was empty out the reservoir here what i'm going to do now is let this continue and then i'm going to run distilled water through the entire system one more time and then when we come back we'll be doing the engine ice but i'm going to go ahead and skip the second stage second stage of doing the distilled water because there's no point in showing you guys again what we just did so do what i just did with the distilled water a whole other time let the bike heat up cycle the engine water through the engine and then come back and we'll be here doing the engine ice so as you can see there is very little to no more distilled water dripping at the bottom of bike and we have done two cycles of distilled water getting the bike up to temperature now what it's time to do is put the nut back on the bottom and fill it up with engine ice and after that we're done so i'm gonna go ahead and screw the bottom nut on and then we're gonna start pouring the engine ice into the radiator cap be careful with letting the bike get cool guys do not get impatient and try to do this early the liquid coming out of that bike is really really hot and i don't want you guys to get burned all right guys so here we have one and a half gal or a half a gallon or 1.89 liters of engine ice from what i've read it'll take this entire bucket uh but uh we'll see i guess once i get it all in there grab our handy dandy funnel all righty guys when you're doing this make sure you go slow you got to give the liquids time to like settle once they get in there you can't just pour the whole thing in right off the bat alrighty guys so i can see the engine is coming up to the top of the radiator so we're going to use the remaining and put it in the reservoir and guys i'm putting it in the reservoir you don't want to be full you don't want to be low you want to be somewhere in the middle all right guys so i stuffed as much of the engine ice in as i could the radiator is absolutely full the overfill area is full as well and i've still got a little bit left and this is a 2009 r6 so uh one engine ice thing will do for you again this is a half gallon half gallon of engine ice um and at this point guys we're just going to put the cap back on there's probably going to be some spillage it's probably going to be some spillage because i did put a little too much but this is why we have rags we're gonna get this cap back on get it back in there all right guys so typically at this point you're gonna put your fairings back on for me i do not have fairings yet so i'm going to call that job done this has been a coolant replaced on a 2009 yamaha r6 hope you guys thought the video was interesting and helpful if you did find this video helpful make sure to hit the like button and subscribe to the channel and

years it's just absolutely absolutely stunning all right let me do a little plane i'll talk about the scale length the nut width all everything else don't forget store.you get the pros.com yes kamaka baby yeah do [Music] what do you think of that sound leave a comment right now leave that comment below by the way that was a little piece i wrote literally a little bit yesterday and finished it off today this is for my performance mastery class that i have you collect the pros.com courses memberships and i take people through different things helping them get better and that's what the

to change the spark plugs at least well I went I already caught in halfway took our we took of all the parts I decided to make a video you know IBM and I've been learning so much of a YouTube and I've never you know really given back so this is my giving back um video um if you have a Yamaha if you have an r1 and you don't have the tool kit tool kit that comes with the bike it comes like a little tube this right here tons of these little tools it's there go cheap on ebay I advise that you go ahead and buy one because you're going to need this tool right here this tool right here takes out the spark plug regular sockets you see the two the indentation idea regular sockets they can get in anywhere the spark plugs a so this right here this comes with the the the bike kit that I said they are dirt cheap on um on eBay you know you are obviously going to take off the seat the Box front seat and take off on loosen up the tank you know to take the tank straight off just lift it up some I'm using a little bungee cord and I'm tying in the back so it could be able to hold up you'll be taking these off like I said I already take this mantle the UM the portion you get to the spark plugs you're going to be take this is this is the NPC idea that you slip off it comes with a little bit on this bracket that you can tap off and you get this off take off the clips look off the air vents yeah whatever this cause um just to his I don't know what's the name of this tool or the size of the tool but this is what you're going to need to get this Porsche this this is holding a piece off right here the to slip in here and take soldier schools there's about one two three four five six seven I think seven screws and this tool is is a must it doesn't come with the kit you something you don't get yourself a regular record those regular screwdrivers they're too thick to slip in time slide there okay okay once you get this out get dessert sorry that slip off this I know you see these with air vents right here these little plastic things you need an update take those out the first thing you have to do is you're gonna have to take off the side pieces these side pieces off your bike there's a very important reason why you want to take those off take those off secure all the screws okay the reason why you want to take these off is because when I make this oh this is the middle vendor goes in here these slip inside and slip inside that so youtubers I'm using one hand to do this video the reason why you want to take this these off is because now if you see wet in here yeah they're here is the spark plugs you have one two three and four these two are very easy to come out but these two on the ends you have to take these out oh Christ now they take is the am some of these little vents thingamajigger on or decock take those out so you could be able to get your um your your ratchet and slip inside there let me show you I'm talking about okay hold on a myth put pause hold on one second guys okay this is what I'm talking about you need let me see this is 9/16 which when you get the kit your toolkit and your the long extension piece and this right here go ahead and slip basically stop sorry guys it slips right in there and you can be able to take out the the the spark plug sorry now I'm from the Bahamas Nassau this is made this to be my spark plug looks I never you could focus it out see if I can focus it anyway I can focus for some reason doesn't want to come into focus but it's met a smashed-up there's nowhere on the island that sells this plug so I have to go on eBay right now and um order it but once you have these tools what I mentioned it's very easy to get to the spark plug very various I I paid a guy about I think about $250 that's the waste of my time and if I knew it was going to be this easy to change this plug that's going to do it myself again like I said you have to have these tools the tools I just I just showed you you have to have those tools to do this though if you don't have those tools it's gonna be next to impossible again in here especially taking off there especially taking this off can be very hard to take that off okay youtubers I'm gonna jump on eBay right now to order my um my spark plugs I hope this video helped you guys but like I said it's very easy to take they go take this box we're going by", "4GlnFy6oGWU": "man let's see if this works I'm trying to another camera so far the two digital cameras haven't worked and I don't know what the hell is going on anyway or I've got the clutch cable pulled from the clutch arm I've got clutch cover loosened up you can see that there's you know quite a bit of distance right there between the heads everything's you know unscrewed pretty good take a look through the oil filler cap take a look at the clutch pull rod all right if you can see that right there a silver thing that is the clutch pull rod coming from the clutch basket into the clutch cover all right I'll show you how mine's lined up if you can see this just barely to the lift I'll click it out once like how yours looked all right and see it's to the right a little bit right there and that's too far if you have your clutch set like that you won't be able to get enough slack and your cable and your nan to fill on the lever is going to be very tight and will look back to the oil filler hole where that flashlight again and kind of hard to see but there is the quartz pull rod again no teeth exposed still that's what you want to see put that little filler cap back on and just to explain the ratcheting thing real quick since you know other people might want to know or whatever all right this is what I'm referring to is turning to the left this way towards me back that way towards the front of the bike I'm considering right so I'm going to continue to turn it left it's like 10 clicks or something and see you notice when I push to the left clutch cover comes forward pull to the right it pulls in that's how you know the pull rods in there there I think was my last one check the alignment back to the way it was so I'm going to do is put the clutch clutch cable back in the arm here and first them unbolt all these back down all the clutch cover bolts then what I usually do is take a crescent wrench and stick it against the spine right here of the arm rotate it forward until you get some resistance and then rotate it a little more forward and that will give you enough play with the cable and everything to get it in there easily and it's pretty much it for right now man if you're having any other problems you can't figure it out post up some more messages or whatever and I'll see if I can't help you figure it out but yeah just let me know man hopefully it helps later", "O_f0i3bZIrU": "hi Gordon here with another edition of the unscripted series you know I was asked to question how do we avoid burnout and it's an it's an interesting question I'll start with the fact that the you know we were just passionate about what we do and for Shara and I we never get away from it and we don't want it we may not be in the shop but we're on email or on the website or on the database and you know we just love that and I hope that we always will we early on we worked in the shop you know three four five days a week and then when we started kind of the uke tracker thing and in scheduling ourselves in a more well scheduling ourselves out into the future and be very being very specific about what days we were going to work we worked in the shop four days a week and then we ramped up to five days a week and the problem with that was that we ended up being in the shop seven days a week and so let's see if we built our first ukulele in the summer spring summer of 08 then we had ramped up to five days a week very consistently toward the about a year later and toward the end of 09 and in the middle of 2010 beginning let's say of 2010 we were at a solid five days a week but as I said that we were booked five days a week were in the shop seven and then we took a month off we went to South America we went to the Galapagos Island islands and Machu Picchu and that was a great experience for us because we totally got away from the business and at that point we said you know we are on path to burn out and we don't want to burn out and we use this expression often we're running a marathon and in a marathon you don't sprint maybe at the very end but you don't want to burn and so we backed off to four days a week and then we backed off to a mix and I'm talk about shop days now a mix of three or four and now we're solidly at three and that is a pace that we think we can maintain for a long long time the the rhythm in the shop is very different from when we're out of the shop you know I'm out of the shop right now in fact i'm on vacation and I'm doing my ammo work but I don't have to I I don't have to do this today the shop when we're scheduled like we're scheduled for this sunday and when when I go out when we go out I mean we have to go out otherwise you tracker is off and people go away I think they would what's going on with my instrument and so I think that requirement weighs heavy on our mind and that's the requirement with that we wanted to keep to a reasonable minimum at three days a week with erin i think what he would say is that whereas sharra and I want to be in touch seven days a week 24 hours a day basically Erin would say I need to get away from it so we booked him in the shop for four days a week and he is not responsible for any owner interaction at all so he avoids burn out by getting away for three days a week and just putting it out of his mind and not having to you know that's how he recharges his batteries and doing some other things and so anyway that's the answer to how we avoid burnout first of all mentally we look at this as a marathon not as a sprint and we schedule ourselves accordingly and if we see any elements my experience in business is that if you burned out it's too late it is unrecoverable so I want to see that way off in the distance so that I can make some adjustments to it with char and I or erin and adjusting accordingly and we try to measure that pretty carefully so it's a very cool question that you ask and that's the answer see you next week bye bye", "ru1tq396PHg": "my cylinder head has come back from the machine shop where it was bead blasted clean and I'm beginning the process of reassembling it now the factory manual recommends that if you replace the valves in this cylinder head they should be lapped in that's what I'll be doing if I was installing titanium valves then no I would not but when all else fails go with what the factory manual says is my rule I've done 16 of my 20 valves and after doing 16 valves I have definitely learned what works and what doesn't so let me walk through the steps that I've been using I'm no expert but I've definitely learned a few things that I want to pass on about hand lapping valves first is I definitely recommend taking your head and get get your valve seats cut by a CNC machine you know if it's a couple hundred bucks to do that your time is going to be probably worth more than that and I'm investing anywhere between a half an hour and an hour on every single one of these valves at least so but here's the procedure I've been walking through and it's working pretty good I take the new valve because I'm installing all new valves first thing I do is I clean it off because it comes shipped with a little bit of anti-corrosion compound on it once I have the valve cleaned off and you can see that's what is on it to start with I've been using some blue dye chem to coat the valve the outer surface is where it comes into contact with the valve seat I'm going to bed this one in and wrap it into this central intake port so I coat that with dye chem I let that dry and then I have a combination of lapping compounds now what I'm finding is working well is I start with 500 grit my valve seats are in pretty good shape if your valve seats are shot again go get a machine you can lap for the rest of your life and you won't be able to fix the the heavy damage in a in a highly corroded valve seat I'm starting with 500 grit and then I use that to gauge whether I need to go to a more coarse grit or whether I can stay at 500 or even go higher that gives me a kind of a baseline of what am I looking at the other thing is you cannot rely on the naked eye I can look at this valve see with my eye it looks fantastic when I look at the valve seat under magnification I see something entirely different I'm using a little 10 power jeweler's loupe but you can you know use anything you have a magnifying glass or a workbench illuminated magnifying lens with this jeweler's loupe I can see every tiny little defect and it gives me a completely different perspective throughout this process I'm going to be inserting this valve and removing it cleaning it putting on different compounds something I have definitely been careful about is when I insert this valve into its valve guide if I feel any grittiness or any resistance to that valve sliding down on the guide I immediately pull it out I don't force it down in the valve guide I pop it out I squirt the valve guide with some contact cleaner to clean it out and I squirt the valve stem to clean it you don't want any grit or any of this lapping compound to make its way down into the valve guide so keep that thing clean and you'll know because as soon as you insert it you'll feel a little greediness or the valve guide just won't slide right down don't force it don't push it down there alright so for my first cut into the valve seat to see where I'm at I start with 500 grit lapping compound I apply it to the outside edge of the valve don't go overboard you don't need a ton that right there is plenty I don't contaminate the valve stem and I let that valve stem drop right down now this is the most important thing I've learned in this whole process and that is in order to cut this seat you could spin this valve around with a drill or with a lapping tool a bunch of times in a row around and around and around I don't recommend doing that what I found is that silicon carbide grit that's in this lapping compound as you start to turn this that grit will sort of make its way up and make its way down outside that contact surface if you spin this thing around and around what seems to happen is some of that grit gets trapped into the same channel and it cuts a nice groove all the way around this seat if you lap this thing back and forth and I'll do it from underneath here what I found is if you go back and forth like this and you can even do a few turns in one direction a few turns in the other direction that compound makes its way up and down and then after a few turns lift it up spin it around a little bit drop it back down and do it again and that has a way of getting that compound back right into the center of that that contact surface also when you do this you'll hear a change it'll sound very scratchy because that's what's happening is this that grits scratching the surface and as that silicon carbide particles move up and down you'll hear hear it get smoother and smoother as soon as I hear it smoothing out I pick it up move it around and start again and for the first cut I'll do this I don't know maybe for a couple of minutes to three minutes back and forth at which point I will then pull my guide out remove it and now I'll clean the compound off the valve and off the valve seat and with that die cam I'll now be able to leave a clean towel with no parts cleaner on it if it has parts cleaner on it we'll take that dye came right off and I want that ink to stay on there I just do a quick cleanup and now I can look at the valve seat and I can clearly see where there's ink sitting on that contact surface both with the naked eye and even better under magnification with this you can actually see the craters and other imperfections all along that contact surface now what I'll be doing is periodically while lapping I'll come back and Riaan Specht am i cutting that seat down are those imperfections getting scraped away and do I need to go to a more coarse grid or is it time to go ahead and move up to a finer green compound and again you really need to see this under magnification to appreciate it I'm hoping I can get some high-res pictures that I can then intersperse here and show you what this looks like all right so now under my magnifier you can better see what this valve head looks like once it's been left for a little bit where you've got that die cam on either side of the area that was actually in contact and what you're looking for here is that nice even with dull gray without any blue die cutting across that blue surface if this surface was pitted there'd be low spots and it still be some blue dye in there so we want to see that nice even gray just like that that is a brand new valve so this is exactly what I would expect and here's the valve seat so under magnification you can see the blue dots that go all the way around this valve seat surface those are the low spots and that's going to require more lapping I hit that valve seat with 240 grit and now satisfied that I've got most of the defects out of it it's now rough I'm going to I'm going to go up to the 500 grit first thing I'm gonna do is completely clean off this valve I don't want any remnant of that 240 grit understand I've also already cleaned up the seat and reapplied some dye chem so they can now go to my 500 grit and I'll probably spend about I don't know five or ten minutes working on this same process just going to head it back and forth I'll start out with pretty high pressure on this thing work it in good and then do that for a minute or so then back it off a little tiny bit go easy medium pressure setting routine bring it out clean it off take a look at the ink stains across the valve seat keep working this until I'm satisfied I've gotten the seat about as good as I can practically get it then I'll finish it off with some 800 grit I'll clean everything off again clean the valve put the 800 grit on there work that for a few minutes you know five minutes or so to get a 800 grit even surface across the whole thing when it's all said and done it's not going to be a mere finish 800 grit isn't even close to mirror finish but that's not really what you need",
