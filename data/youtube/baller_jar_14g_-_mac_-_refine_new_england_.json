said i don't buy their products often and it's not because of the quality it's strictly because of the price and i'm a boy on a budget so it is what it is but when you can get it for the right price hundred percent worth it at all cost every time i get their sand whenever i can usually however this time i did pass up the sand because i bought this that's how much i wanted to try this stuff and as good as it is i'm so glad i got three and a half great jar oh yeah it's not very often i can truly stock up so i'm grateful it's so smooth it's truly a unique flavor i don't even know how to really describe it to be honest with you i just really like it it's sweet without being overpowering it's not so mildest to be unnoticeable but not so strong is to be just crazy in your face nice happy medium for flavor very smooth no throat burn not really any tickle i do enjoy that i'm already getting a nice buzz going to dab in and i'm i'm happy now to be fair i did vape a bowl of flour before i did this but that's it that doesn't really affect me like dabs do i don't do flour that often so it's definitely the jesus og kicking in which is sweet i'm glad i did it worth every penny so with that said thank you very much for tuning in for watching i appreciate all the support i've been getting all the feedback it's been awesome uh instagram facebook all of it i hate facebook so i don't get on

and hang out it's just got done prepping for another hash wash damn it getting cold in here too because of that I might have to go grab my jacket but um yeah got the AC cranked to 62 degrees that the ice-cold water in the reservoir I've got a bag of ice for the washer and I've got six more bags ice out in the freezer I need to get a bigger freezer and all the materials well so later tonight after I get the kids down spend some time with the wife I'm gonna come back out here and knock out that bubble hash run uninterrupted probably gonna do somewhere between six to eight runs on it depending on how it looks and how everything is coming out [Music] anyways let's go ahead and get a - go in here I hope you guys are having a good day [Music] that was not clickbait by the way for those of you this joint this is a 104 grant or 100 Ford's a hundred grams now mixed strain hash frothing some cookies some sweet cream some zukie and what else sweet cream cookie sweet cream zoo keys and orange cookies that's what it is [Music] sorry I had someone from work pop-up I don't look out real quick [Music] all right cool [Music] anyways let's go ahead oh it's so good yeah I need to go ahead and fill up a little bit char with that [Music] this was some 60 micron parabola for edibles [Music] this one still has a cush cake in it and this one has on a fish cake so those that's my head - cooks cake in a jar [Music] earth is [ __ ] cold and her alright so I would like you yet in my day did you imagine dabbing that whole thing just like here we feel [ __ ] half the Banger ease and the easily I wouldn't even try it it'd be a waste and a half that's good enough for me enjoy that for the week [Music] the 160 press was man very little in there so that's what that looks like when I end up putting it in the jar and then a lot of people would ask me how did you get that [ __ ] rossington to stick to the bottom of the jar look so neat [Music] here's I take the glove and you're just going to push it down around the edges towards the center you're doing a cold room that's good rosin a clean glove and just like that now it looks like that [Music] with that's hard to see but yeah that's how that comes out when you end up doing that push it down it comes out real nice and clean looking perfect for grams or so it's upload a bird [Music] all right so I gotta move my dad station over now I'm not pressing it back over here well I like it Kiyo is : grab yeah you can do with parchment - I have a little bit more control with the glove I feel like and it rarely gets sticky but parchment works to a more sticky stuff I will use parchment I'm gonna go grab a hoodie real quick [Music] [Music] whoa [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] whoo my tears my eyes [Music] Oh [Music] oh man the big dads always get my nose my eyes [Music] Oh [Music] about three days away from the harvest yeah we're on day 54 honestly I think I could pull them down tomorrow or the next day I want it probably gonna go ahead and harvest them on Monday [Music] today's Thursday tomorrow's Friday yep I'm go ahead and harvest them on Monday [Music] five six out of the gate 58 [Music] [Music] I got some pictures of the plants I haven't even posted to Instagram yet pausing to share them with you guys real quick [Music] [Music] turn down the lights already this whole side is just [ __ ] Mileena should be up here these ones dried back a little bit too much almost too much but not too two months still prosti of [ __ ] 12 cars black out there my Spade going over there [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so that's the current status in the Guardian you know just like oh my flesh for usually you're about seven days it's that but you know [Music] I had issues this run just like Ross Leafs his issues because he's in cocoa they're harder to detect early and so he faced the consequences of the buffering that cal-mag provides in coma cocoa I wasn't in at nursery iam so I was able to turn my issues around a little bit faster but you know basically what I'm saying is you know I had issues this run and the crop is still coming out pretty good so next run you know those issues will be corrected I'll make a video covering the issues that I ran into this grow and how I plan to correct them and I'll throw it up on the patreon hopefully you guys can learn from some of my mistakes you know I talked about on the show doing your own research and shape one of the things I researched if I should have used top-down broward rivers and when I talked to mango tech Abadi he told me to use two gallons per hours to avoid clog and that's what each use is but then I ended up getting water channeling that is too fast on the float and I cost a lot of issues I never really fed high enough of an ECE to have the easy build up nor did I ever push the plants that hard to cause them to have any lockouts it was all because my irrigation was wrong from the get-go with the water swim [Music] are you taking off right now that's one of the changes I'm implementing is not only am I going to get rid of the 2 gallon per hour but I'm going to go all the way down to like a point 3 gallon per hour dripper that could eat drawstring and stuff up here so yeah that'll fix a lot of issues right off to that that I believe uh Charles and pastor [Music] that Daffy got me hired balls rolling in on me now [Music] oh my bad I look here looking up and showers my phone [Music] there's no broad my issues going on in here all it is is either a they were different cuts or they were microclimates right he talked about the water channeling so you know phosphorus deficiency can learn to purpling stems and the plants that express themselves differently also has purple stems where I was the ones that didn't have the red bugs didn't have purple stems so I think it was more of a microclimate issue water channeling issue causing different uptake different nutrients and it just got exacerbated due to the lockout because of the water channeling so next one I'm doing is with wedding cake and I should be getting those clones in about two weeks so I have about two weeks to prep get the plants chopped harvested and everything I'll flip them right in the room that they're in right now I'm basically going to push the tables to one side of the room and then I'll go in and use a light rail for this up against the wall and I'll cut down on the one plant out of time and hang it on a trellis hanging from the ceiling and then I'll just hang all the plants from one light all right [Music] when my moustache hairs on the know it wouldn't happen I got trim my mustache geez so yeah basically just go one light at a time right down hole lights worth of plants hang them go to the next one cut those down hang out on a different trailer that's there the next one so I'll have three trellis nets hanging on the side of the room I'll have to retry this netting on that side of the room so after I cut down the whole left side of the room and those plants are hanging up there on that left side I'm going to disassemble the tables and walk them out of the room and then I can push that whole other table completely over to the middle of the room hang up all those buttons on the back side of the room or wherever in the room right and then basically I'll be good to go I'll get everything hung I'll turn off the shaker fan I'll just keep one of them on probably maybe turn it down to low or something and I'll just have to DEET you and AC going in there I'll be able to scrub down the you the four by twelve that's in there now scrub it down and get it reset and start making my adjustments to the room while I wait on my new 4 by 12 American Girl products they're probably they told me it was going to be issued early June like June 8th or 6 but they might be able to get it in sooner so I mean worst case scenario the room will be down for about three weeks while I wait on the new table but I'll just match all the plants on one table while I'm doing that perfect and then when I get my new table in I'll be able to go ahead and transition the plants over throw up my trellis mats and pretty much switch so you know that's the plan and like I said I'll document all the changes to the room it said of everything that I'd be like want to document the changes and yeah my keeper fee no cuts from honest genetics should be here in the next two to three weeks and solved a whole room full of wedding cake in there veg and flour that while I have a child my keeper he knows from our genetics and my new keeper you know caked up cherries wedding cake crossed with cherry something f3 I'm going to do the three-tiered setup but I'm waiting on him to send me the updated invoice for the new poles and as soon as I get those I'll be able to set it up and I'll have pretty much what I was thinking of doing them what happened to rekey poofy nose and I could basically put all of them on their own tier if I wanted and then have clones next to it or I could just put all the moms on one and then since I'm doing two tables at a time I'll just pick you know I'll have two tiers for clothes you know cherry cookies have three thank you thank you thank you I never remember like my keeper he knows from honest I don't remember what I was are either blue hurricane 27 crossed with white sunrise for the blue lion keeper and then scarlet sure is chocolate frosting crossed with something I think [Music] I trust my man on his genetics he tells me yo this is a [ __ ] you should run for a hash let's fire fire fire legs all right now you got it [Music] like I remembered it enough to purchase it and you know that's all that matters now that's all that matters now I need to show up in the garden [Music] so stoked I have I'll have the blue Hawaiian which is gonna have exotic super crazy unique blue Terps it's gonna be highly sativa dominant as far as the high goes and then the truck not the truck cherry but the cakes of cherries that's gonna be my cherry Fino right there so I'll have a blue of a cherry and then I have the gassy out of scarlet shirt so it's gonna be dope [Music] this is real the kind of light that I use for clowns are right behind either the raging raging kales and I actually got sponsored by science LED yeah so I will be getting now raging candle LEDs probably twice a year during two biggest ways that I do and it couldn't be [ __ ] dope it can really know and then every other month or so I'll be giving away a bunch of science LED swag hats ashtrays shirts things like that all be put on there grower spotlight on their homepage pretty shortly here I have some pictures that I have to take for them and type up some some information and what else asked me to leave to help them do research spectrum tuning and hash production so I'll be doing that so and then also the big thing I'll be an authorized reseller for their lights on my webpage as soon as it's up in a few days so as soon as the page is up I'm going to try and get them on there and I'll be able to resell a life through my page so that way you know they don't do they don't do coupon codes like people in the industry you got to use to coupon codes because of for flex and all that but what that does is it makes it so that you can't sell that product in brick-and-mortar stores anymore and in the hydro industry almost need brick-and-mortar stores still surprisingly to you know expand and survive because still a big commercial facilities go through these hydro stores and you know direct to these manufacturers a lot so they don't do coupon codes they're like let's say they offer a 10% discount code here in California right and somebody purchases a light from you know from me and using my promo code but they're in Oregon or something and or somewhere else where they maybe don't charge sales tax and now not only are they getting the 10% off but they're also getting like seven or eight maybe taking even up to 10% off of that because of no sales tax right whereas if they were to purchase it in the store you know the store would be able to make a profit but in order to compete with that price that they would get you know from using the coupon code the brick-and-mortar store would basically have to not turn a profit so it doesn't work out for them to be able to give people who coupon codes stacked as representatives of the brand so instead I'll be able to be a reseller and then just a very very small portion of the profit that they would make from that light will go towards me instead so I'll be an authorized reseller and then basically helping do research and you know passing that information you guys like I have been this whole time so anyways this is what we're working with they bought this is delicious delicious it's called cookie dough and it's amazing [Music] I don't suspect this is gonna last long you won't need a code to let them know who sent you because you're gonna go through my website to purchase they're working on other programs like referral codes and things like that but [Music] yeah I guess I should keep this on camera so people don't think that I'm like lying and I say I got a grandfather drive here we did well today it's real I wouldn't had a couple more but honestly you guys want to get jars of the grape Cosby and literally all I have left of this [Music] that's it but in this drawer it's maybe maybe seven grams six seven grams of the grape Cosby I think the other jars been scraped empty already yeah scraped empty great cause be gone on that one and then the hell a Koosh cake [Music] there's like maybe two to three grams to scrape out of here [Music] and this one I think is scraped completely empty yeah there's maybe like point two in here it's empty so there was 70 72 grams of the La Push cake and 60 grams of the Cosby [Music] but every time you come in here you [ __ ] promotin be real oh no no no who was it last time it wasn't beaver oh it was your boy the other one that's not good Bernhard that's who it was last time [Music] about your ass sorry yo for real alright here's the funny story that's how you guys are quick so the reason this one got called rape Cosby because [Music] my wife and I dabbed it and she got so [ __ ] high off of it it was like she got roofied like straight roofie I could have done anything I wanted to so I was like mother kali shake great cosby it tastes like grapes and knocks you the [ __ ] out like you did this it was between grape Cosby and roofie colada you know think of work 12 but you guys got to make sure you do it right [Music] it's great cause be like that lowercase G Capital are [Music] all right let's get [Music] a little credit given to me I need a label hood [Music] it's not for grams but whatever [Music] you know [Music] so we're gonna get some cookie dough on there a menace [Music] they push tape on there [Music] [Music] [Music] me up a man popular science [Music] my episode 5 right there alone [Music] [Music] there was a five [Music] [ __ ] bones knock out maybe this is episode [Music] all right hold on okay [Music] but right now it is [Music] but few days that idiot that ain't the one all right well [ __ ] it I'll get it uploaded I was trying to do it right now but I'm having a little bit of a hard time finding a you write for [Music] oh here it is [Music] [Music] that's not it either I have like a lot of different files in here that I have to go through [Music] that's three lighting maybe this is the right here number four [Music] okay yeah here it is and as this little my everybody [Music] alright I'll go ahead and get this uploaded to YouTube right you know [Music] I'm kind of done editing these I'm just gonna start uploading the RAW files and if people don't like it they can kiss my ass I don't have time to edit them together anymore that's why I put the PowerPoint how I did you know if I do the PowerPoint I don't have to worry about putting an intro and all that into the video it's just boom okay boss [Music] alright crap dude my science for plant nutrition are a cool description I'll edit that later now don't care playlist crafted science done no it's not made for kids don't have to restrict [Music] monetization please do [Music] public [Music] boom what is instant premiere oh [ __ ] we could watch it together at the same [ __ ] time let's [ __ ] do that right now I did not know we could do that that is really cool we can watch the video together yeah three minutes five all right it's 321 I'm gonna go in at 3:45 and help the wife for the day because that's the way it is [Music] I find on finishing of the loose jars oh that's the one section of illustrator [Music] this is it makes a great Cosby and Kush cake [Music] I don't know what I did mother two minutes [Music] okay a little poison for 30 minutes okay no accident since a wait okay I'll be in by say like 3:45 okay okay [Music] 59 seconds left [Music] very good dogs very good slowly giving them a little bit more freedom and hoping that they don't [ __ ] pee anywhere [Music] green jeans with Superdome [Music] Greenjeans was sooo Oberto 11 seconds 8 seconds that's called your video will premiere what's uploading and processing finished as well as the hundred percent uploaded is 95 percent process I have no idea how this is going to look for you guys I don't know how this works I've never done this before it is [ __ ] top-down so we're gonna check it out oh my god dollars people my DM right now [Music] all right you guys let me know what happens on your end when this is done hopefully I mean it doesn't take forever right now it's an remember you two processes videos one definition at a time so the low definition stuff is going to process and then like for whatever and then 720 and 1080 [Music] my phone right now it's just doing the load F [ __ ] the standard definition version we'll see whatever the [ __ ] back [Music] I'm really curious to see what this does though man that was such a good [ __ ] good [ __ ] episode and then episode 5 I'm glad we took a break because we were really [ __ ] burned out both of us and we needed a skip a week we came back and we didn't even have a PowerPoint or anything but it was still an amazing discussion Garrett jumped online from science at levy and he just [ __ ] to talk about what we wanted to talk about which was great just you know [Music] we just talked about troubleshooting it was [ __ ] awesome you know he get his perspective on things like walking into like a huge commercial facility and how you would troubleshoot their [ __ ] to figure out what's going on why certain part of the crop might not be doing its good versus another part things like that so it was really cool to get his perspective because you know as far as lost leaf goes he's a commercial facility but he's a one-man army and it's a small commercial facility it's the size of a house basically a one-story house and so and that's that's no diss whatsoever [ __ ] it's amazing what he's doing I wish I could be at his level but in the realm of commercial grows it's relatively small so you know his perspective is one and then Maya the home grower is another and then Gary brings a whole different perspective being that he's kind of more on the large large scale commercial and so it was really cool you know and go with it so unfortunately during this whole Cove 8:19 thing all of the HD recordings for webinars are being limited and only being allowed standard definition so this is not going to be best of qualities for the uploads that are going on right now from the webinars and there's nothing that we can do about that so you know [Music] check it on the patreon real quick make sure you guys got your post real quick [Music] are you guys waiting on me to take another dab is that what's going on [Music] I guess [Music] it's not what you guys I feel like a little [ __ ] a dab [ __ ] for you guys it's all you guys wanna take your dad show me his plan it's never hey SB Andy how's your day go what'd you do today need some help no I'm just [ __ ] one shot I already forgot what this one is again that's the coach tasted positive and he's more paper towels real quick cuz my house got so high I forgot to clean the [ __ ] banger after the last job that's [ __ ] I I guess I Cosby myself whoever said don't cause be yourself I can't be myself go clean it out real easy paper towels to clean [Laughter] [Music] yeah all of the rapidly science episodes go on patreon pretty much the same day or minimum a week earlier than YouTube a minimum and Matt doesn't post on lost leaf as a poster or anything like that out of respect for my patreon supporters he knows he waits again he's a week two to three weeks even suppose I mean it's not that I don't want the information out there for everybody but I wanted to I want to give some [ __ ] love to the people on patreon and economic access all that and they can pick my brain talk about it on live sessions or whatever brain different [ __ ] you know [Music] all right the tip of my II now is 395 and I need to grab another roll of paper towels real quick [Music] [Music] damn [ __ ] oh yeah [Music] oh [ __ ] [Music] in the filter [Music] oh Jesus son 525 that is a very very high [ __ ] gasps Jesus [Music] [Music] so the reclaim catcher works by basically a when you draw on the dab it gets stuck down here because all that reclaimed can't travel back up pretty much so what you end up with really is just tiny tiny pieces of the vapor that condensed back to rosin in here versus a shit-ton of replaying and if you have a really good deep-dish banger and you do low temp doubts your your reclaim actually can look really nice how well that looks but [Music] seeing us a thing FPV not everybody's email setup is the same not all coils are created equal so you got to get you know a good coil setup with

actually launching it in all retail locations please tell us some something exciting and that what does your means to you yeah so I mean I kid again 14 months into this project I could talk for about this project off its jar actually says it's the high quality stuff just a regular piece garden high-quality we renovated into our Baba jar or flower most tests over 30 percent THC it's got to check the boxes for turkey profiles for smell for look just for overall consistency only the best of the best of King's garden goes into these baller jars this is project we started from the very GetGo we did it had to be something special to fit the most special flower in that this is a deep boss autumn jar last jar custom cap deep oz cap filled in black ink there thermo printed this is this is a project that was a love/hate thing for both Mike and I and something we were really excited at launching the public that actually kind of weren't went really well and just had yeah you know tried it

is i haven't i haven't pressed a lot of moxie uh in a while so this will be fun this stuff is ringing in at uh 26.9 percent combined thc thca we've got a 121 micron bag here and the crd 30 ton triptech rosin press is set to 180 degrees fahrenheit i don't use timers i don't use the gauge that's on this pump so please don't ask me how long i leave it on just watch the video and you'll see how long i leave it on for okay so this has been rehydrated with hydra stones and we're going to load this bag up hope everybody is staying safe staying medicated and being good to each other out there just a reminder if you are a medical marijuana patient in the pittsburgh area and you have dispensary flour and you would like to have it turned into gold please come and see me in penn hills here at the studio i do that for patients i press form for free that is a patient's helping patients initiative that i've been doing since 2018 never charge a patient to press their medicine for it it is important that patients get good quality medicine at a price that they can afford and i am trying to help in that respect so here is our quarter get this thing all put into a nice little package and move these lights up here and get this placed right where i want it to be there we go that paper of course anytime you're doing live stuff okay all right so let's get that out of the way and get this centered up where i want it to be get the light in there on it real good so you can see it get real close and put it right there all right here we go let's get this valve closed on the pump let's make some medicine there's nothing i enjoy more right now than just getting the best that this flower can offer and as long as you treat this plant with respect she will give herself to give you the best medicine that you can have much better quality than anything you will get in the dispensary as a concentrate solidness is definitely the way to go and rosin whether it be hash rosin or flower rosin is a step way bigger than any of the commercially available chemically extracted concentrates so let's just remember where the quality is and the flavor because this is a full spectrum extract and take terpenes and winterize it do all kinds of crazy stuff they just you just get the buds and the essence of them their soul that's the way i like to approach it so as you can see it's going to get harder and harder to see so i'm going to let this go now and start concentrating on this press i'm going to let that heat soak in for about 30 seconds before i finish get the full pressure i don't know if there's any big drops tomorrow for the weekend but i would be watching the healing center my tree rise all of those guys because you know how that goes friday if you get a big drop and if you're not ready to grab it online you can lose out real easy all right almost at pressure there we go that's where i want to be with it let it sit there for a minute i'm going to pull this shot back out oh yeah this should be fun so again moxie doesn't come out with a lot of flour they've been coming out with more lately and i don't get a chance to press much of it because it's usually at the high end of the price spectrum not a lot of patients bring it to me so i figured i'd grab some and we'll see what see what it does you know and there isn't a whole lot else you can do except uh try it and it goes into my database you find out how it stacks up against the other grower processors and the other strains that they're putting out so i'm just getting the scale ready i already have a jar make sure i get the tear on that first seventeen yep that's great okay are you ready you ready to see it here we go okay viper cookies what'd you give us oh oh yes oh yeah i'll tell you what take a look at that that looks mighty mighty fine to me so let us get that paper off of here turn off the i am done pressing unless unless there's a patient that comes over with something for me let me get the shot out and redirected all right a small blowout no big deal take my tools here clean a little bit of clean rosin off the end of that but like i said blowouts happen no matter whose bag you're using luckily they don't happen all the time so let's get this fired up tara and philip she looks like a happy plant this thing was coming off looking like it was made from washed flour uh and that it didn't just come from straight flour some of this consistency is very reminiscent of a lot of hash rosin i see being shown on ig gas rosin's fantastic it's just not practical for medical patients in pennsylvania because of our prices you know so pennsylvania and the medical marijuana program flower rosin is king of solidness because you can't get the good stuff good ash rosin at the dispensers they don't sell it they don't make it people who do make it aren't making it for the legal market so best you're gonna get medicine wise from somebody who can craft it immediately for you somebody like me who's doing flower rosin just like this gotta love this plant with all your heart to be good at doing this consistently you got to be having access to flour that is of amazing quality to get this kind of result oh this stuff came out so beautiful oh yeah oh moxie my good friend dave perlow gabe pirlo who is the ceo of moxie he and i have had a very nice relationship as far as his business ideas about doing solventless believe me when the feds lift the the lid off this whole thing and deschedule this plant you're gonna start seeing a lot more solventless on the market because it will be on the recreational side probably but you will see it moxie has always been a concentrate centric company it started off they didn't have the canopy enough to to sell flowers so all they sold were their really nice concentrates and their cartridges i love their cartridges liquid moxies melon wreck is awesome ellerange is fantastic a big fan of their distillate cartridges but their flowers always been kind of rare you know now they're stepping up their their production ability and now they're coming out with more flour which is really cool so let's see what we got for a yield and wow 0.61 well when you take away the 17 grams for the jar that is well that is not what i would consider an acceptable yield okay again my bare minimum acceptable yield is half half a gram per eight this comes out to be point three per eighth which i mean here's the thing though the quality is amazing okay and in terms of the look of it it smells incredible you know but there it is maybe i can get it you can see the better light i mean look at the quality of that there's no disputing the fact that moxie makes really good flour the problem is the flour that they make or that they grow doesn't have the wax and lipid profiles to make them a good candidate for solventless extraction via rosin press so always bear in mind that when you're going to buy flour you need to pick strains that work for you and you have to be willing to accept that you may get a strain like this like this viper cookies which looks to be amazing probably going to taste incredible uh but the yield is not sufficient for for me from for me personally it may be for you as a patient you may be a baller and can afford to buy enough eights to get enough of this pressed to make it worth medicating with it i tend to look for the higher producing strains i think this is an excellent strain i bet it's a great strain for the other uses dry vaping quote unquote um but for rosin it's one i would probably take a pass on personally but if you're seeing this and you're liking what you see grab yourself some dispensary flower and get on over here to penn hills and come and see me and i will do this for you too stay safe stay medicated be good to each other everybody have a good day", "0J-u3DRWQiU": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] baby girl I'm female bigger I'm fiending know goddamn well a water-loving

quote-unquote jar tech but the way I like it is to make the material really buttery and really hard so what I do to get that material pretty much all I've done so far is I squish seven grams of flour I put it it got it from the parchment and with my tool and I've put it on to a jar with no lid in between plates and it's out 1:29 and sitting at that for about 10 minutes so I'll come back to you guys and probably about half an hour to an hour once that's a little bit more buttered up so I can whip it and I'll let you guys know what I mean by whipping it then because you can see that's already kinda starting to butter up and that's what we want but we're gonna let it go for about another half hour to an hour so see you guys yep so what I have done here is I've pretty much just taken a little dab tours you can see right there there's now a little bit dirty and I've just stirred this rosin around I noticed that one part was getting really buttery but the rest was staying really runny I actually even noticed that it's trying to build like some sort of I mean try to zoom in there some sort of like little diamonds or like some hard pieces of rosin super-dope but um as you can see it's been whipped now and I'm just gonna put it right back in here this was about half a minute back this was about half an hour in that we whipped it so once again it's just insane out 1:29 it's been in there for about half an hour we just whipped it pretty much stuck a the blossom stick in there and stirred it around mixed it up for about 30 seconds to a minute and then put it right back on the plates and now we're going to sit there for maybe another hour maybe another 30 minutes I'll be back to you guys when that's 1020 minutes from the last video maybe I don't know 30 minutes in - after the whip as you can see we're having very nice crystallization you can see him some big diamonds starting to form we're gonna let this keep going let it keep buttering up and so they could keep doing its thing beautiful we're probably about an hour in since the last video and what I have here pretty much is a very stable a little bit buttery you can see the Terps popping up on top but it's pretty much starting to harden up and as you can see this is that consistently and see I said I wanted from the beginning although I'm still gonna let it go for probably about another half hour or so everyone and how's it going this is pretty much all finished up I started at 11:53 it's now 147 so probably took like a little over two hours I don't know but this is pretty much then the results as I like it this is very hard all of this pretty much puffed up and became very solid like it's all butter and that's how I like my rosin so if you guys don't like it like that you could have left it at the point where it's diamonds or whatever but once again this is just a little tutorial on how I like to do my rosin tag and the kind of results I like to go for kind of things I do and how I do it but yeah guys this is an official tutorial if you guys want any of things I used pretty much all I used was unlocks master unit two heaped up to press the rosin and to heat it up and if you guys want you can use this kind of code yeah I'm stoned and I'll save you guys a bunch of money on these presses or on DeYoung the mini that I used because this is where I made the rosin so I'm yeah if you guys more a mini or alex master you in there like that just discount code yeah I'm stoned one word you guys will be able to save some money at Knox Master Lock yeah guys it's the finished product I hope

not with this thing anyways but I'm about to show you a super easy way to get every last bit of hash out of every one of your containers this is gonna save you so many doubts right now on the stream answers to all the questions you've ever had about weed what's up i'm matt welcome back to the strange show this is a channel for adults and patients where i answer all the questions you've ever had about weeds you don't know how many of these little containers like this or maybe even worse the even smaller ones like this that i've thrown away that still have some hash inside of them a long time ago i never knew how to get the last dab or two out of these things and it would drive me crazy until i learned how to make a turn to tell me Tyler showed me this so shout out to Tyler thank you buddy this saved my life all three of these containers are pretty much empty I can't get any more on my stick but after we make our Terp tube we're gonna have a few dabs of these guys so super easy you really don't need a couple things first get all your containers that you have that still have just a little bit of hash in them then we're gonna need a drinking straw a pair of scissors and you probably already have your torch handy but we might not even need this first just cut off a few inches of your straw just make sure the piece you cut off is at least a few inches long now we're gonna take the piece that we cut off we're gonna cut a really steep angle on one side of the straw like this now that we've cut at this really steep angle we're gonna cut the pointy side off right there so it's nice and flat on the front and it looks like a little shovel now we have a very flexible tool to scrape our container with and it's hollow and you're gonna see why that's important in just a second but look how good it scrapes this out I mean it gets every drop there's nothing left in this that looks brand-new now and I can do that to all of these I could go around the house and find any of these I might have and try this and it even works in these little tiny ones because the Turk tube is so flexible that it just bends to any shape you smush it to so if your hash isn't as wet is these are if it's too hard to scrape with your turkey that's when your torch is gonna come in now if you have a hairdryer laying around I'd probably use the hairdryer first but you're probably like me and you're sitting here it's all your dabbing stuff in front of you and I don't have a hairdryer in front of me - dad what so I'm gonna use a torch so just take your torch and just barely wand it over your hash container and just gently heat it up just ever so slightly then it should be a little more runny and wet and pliable and you can do that with your torch or a blow-dryer or whatever you could probably just put in your pocket for now or anything to make it warm now all our containers are clean and our Terk tube is full of past but it's way down in the tube how are we supposed to give to this out this is why it's good for it to be held just take your scissors and cut right up the middle of your straw now you can get your dab tool and to scoop it right out of it and now we got a big bat dam out of an otherwise empty container now that's tight that's the success Terp - yo buddy don't forget to subscribe for good vibes and I got nuggets of knowledge cuz when you watch the stream

gorgeous absolutely go just hamburg i can't wait for you to be able to dab bro you guys believe this [ __ ] hambone ain't even going to be able to try this [ __ ] can't have some [ __ ] straight [ __ ] you ask me it's my tradition to get the [ __ ] cultivator high as [ __ ] higher than he's ever been on his stuff before i like to do it i'm not i can't do it to him can't happen but nine to five soon though soon though i'm about to find out right now on the returns did you get my my instagram message right now about the hash return about 120 grams i think we could get another 40 grams out of it on the next run but it's [ __ ] really good high quality [ __ ] like really high i knew from the moment that i pulled it out of the freeze dryer and started sifting it that it was going to be a good yielding press because um the density of the trichome was unreal i had 30 grams in one bag if i ever hit 30 grams in one bag that that right there tells me that those trichomes are dense as [ __ ] because on average i'll hit 20 22 grams right 25 on the high end and then anything over 25 and those trichomes are just [ __ ] solid sand and um you guys want to see a golden vagina i do look at that golden vajayjay a little beat up missing an ovary but you know so um yeah man as soon as i started bagging it and i felt how heavy and dense those trichomes were in my hand in the back i was like yeah this is this is it and then as soon as i weighed the bags out and i saw one of them was 30 and the others were you know 26 and they were only three quarters of the way full um very very easily you could have fit quite a bit more in there so you know let's my early yield without even seeing it just yet altogether i'm gonna guess we're at 100 grams on a return that's just my guess my raw yes at this point in time looking at the jar and just kind of what's here we'll see i haven't had anything yield quite like the runs yet except for the frost factory and the dessert a while ago those things [ __ ] dumped the runts did hit 20 uh 21 percent which was pretty good but back in the day the frost factory and the g6 were getting 25 on the watch which was just [ __ ] ridiculous it was just a big bag of frost it was like i didn't even need to wash it i could have just shook the bag out it was crazy but this [ __ ] quality is great this quality is the same as the runts which is saying a lot you guys because i've never given any collab um that much credit before on their grow to be able to produce a quality as as good as my single source like i'm not arrogant but i do take pride in my work so to be working with another cultivator that's putting out work just as good as my own i don't have to worry about the quality you know what i'm saying it's just crazy crazy awesome to know like i truly don't have to worry about it you know what i'm saying because as a as a processor i kid you not i've run across all types of people in this industry there's very very very few people that can like truly be transparent about everything that they do and still maintain their integrity and you know what i'm saying so it's like he's super transparent with his grows i know what's gone into him i know what hasn't gone into them more importantly and i can trust his word when he says that they haven't been sprayed or they don't have any you know this that or the other whereas other growers i've had tell me that i come back home and i process their [ __ ] you know and lo and behold the hash never lies i don't know if you guys have been into hash long but that's been a saying that i've known since i got into this game the hash never lies all these other vho and all that other [ __ ] it covers up whatever you did wrong during the grow but when you run bubble hash real clean like the truth comes out so it's really nice to not get back here and start processing something to find out that it had been you know covered in [ __ ] oils during the grow and all types of other [ __ ] so let's see [Music] i replaced the filters on my hepa filter from iq air today like 350 bucks to get all three filters i got a pre pre-filter a pre-filter and then the hepa filter i put them all in today brand new and oh my god that [ __ ] is going [ __ ] the air on the ground around it started getting sucked up and it started filtering everything man it was [ __ ] nice see that [ __ ] current so strong on there [Music] oh i got to take a picture of that for handy bone hammer bone oh my god jeez in my bones juice in my pants oh boy you guys are not going to want to miss this if you know how to tap in i suggest you guys tap in now i'm going to go ahead and give this the insta oh my [ __ ] god i just pulled back the top layer on this and eminem y'all aren't gonna want to miss it all right let's get some of that down in there though set this down now we're going to clean the spoon on this side y'all already know we have to i'm going to get everything i can off of this big dab tool real quick on this end using my smaller dab tool and then i'm going to do something that i don't usually do which i don't usually go straight in for the stir but i'm trying something a little different decent amount of little rosin on here we'll be taking a test dab here in a second now i'm gonna see if i can't get my long end all the way down into this to do a little stirring stir [Music] y'all want to see this goody goody gumdrop my [ __ ] goodness holler at your hatch man unreal this won't even last a week guaranteed this won't last 24 hours i am i i'm putting everything on that this is gone gone gone i already know it the heat this is not three weeks worth of dabs for anybody this isn't gone from me smoking it not for me sharing it ain't nobody in there no nobody's smoking this in a week come on now not unless you're rolling it up in a [ __ ] giant blunts and giving them out for free look at that chunk in there that big old juicy thc chunk oh get your song who's your hash man mm-hmm oh boy packing a meal i'm all yeah yeah this is stupid i think i found my new favorite temperature hey baby um yeah but i'm just wrapping up i'll be done in about five well come here give me what's up y'all see it in there just chunks 207 on the 10th trying to incorporate all this stuff on the side to this nice jello pudding apple [ __ ] sauce son you hear that wet wet gushing around in there so so got it at four percent oh how does that always happen like this is just dumb diddly dumb stupid dumb dumb diddly dum dum dum stupid make your video real quick sir [Laughter] bro it's it's just dumb just dumb dumb bro this is like honestly the best collab work that i've had hands down this is easily on par with my single source and this is terpier than the ruts came out yeah at least from the stir it's it was just straight boulders underneath there that's how i always get it to come off the plates though it always comes off like that where i the i get chunks that just develop and it's awesome because when i go pack them into jars people go through and they're like [ __ ] i hit something hard in the jar and they're like oh [ __ ] it's [ __ ] bolder oh dude it's it's like peanut butter consistency but it looks like applesauce with pieces of apple in it yeah yeah yeah so i'm gonna go ahead i gave it this stir right now i'm actually still on the live i'm gonna go ahead and um oh you're good don't matter about to take that dab right now son [Laughter] that is [ __ ] hilarious bro that's awesome so that's what i said what's up telling the other anthony hell yeah that's

going today well you're in for a treat here i'm pressing an ounce of wedding cake and this stuff i i pressed a quarter of it yesterday it came out amazing uh so i had to go back and get more so right on here we got two nut smasher 120 micron 14 gram bags and we're pressing this at 200 degrees on my crd 20 ton drip tech rosin press and if we're lucky we're going to get a chance to show you how it tilts and how it how it drips it right off the plates so here we go hope everybody is having a great thanksgiving hope you're staying safe staying medicated being good to each other out there it was a very low-key day just myself my wife and our and our kitty zina warrior today and watched a little football watched a little movies and now it's time to make a little video that's what we're doing today i hope everybody got some really good flowers some good concentrates whatever it is that you'd like to do with cannabis as far as medicating i hope that you found something that that works for you uh i definitely have this stuff is an indica heavy hybrid very endicoline and it is incredibly incredibly body heavy uh it will pouch-lock you so let's see here just let that heat start to work a little bit before i go up to full pressure let me know what you guys are hitting on in the comments please uh subscribe and and hit the thumbs up if you like this video and the videos that i put out uh bring this pressure up a little bit now see if we can get him to start sweating a little bit gotta keep adjusting the lighting as it as those plates come together it gets harder and harder to give you a good view of things so please bear with me as i readjust things a little bit here to ensure that you're still seeing what's going on now let's start with sweat already you see that the very front edge at the top of the left hand bag and right down at the bottom in the front edge of the right i'm bringing the pressure up gently don't want to risk a blowout at that medicine i'm going to bring it in a little closer for you see that look at that all right let's bring her up to pressure look at that material move look at it move as i add pressure to it look at that beautiful beautiful medicine continuing to bring it up that material still moving once i get where i feel is full pressure on this i will tilt this thing forward and we will see if any of it wants to drip i think we're good right there so bear with me here as i back out of this i'm gonna move the camera a little bit here so you can see what is going on lighting the face down here okay so here we go tilt it and see if it gives us anything there we go all right let's see if i'll get that a little bit better for you look at that medicine [Music] look at that that's what i'm talking about [Music] youth you know a lot of people say they don't like flower raws and they prefer hash rosin or whatever you know what that's fine but quite honestly i get really good clarity really good purity from pressing high quality high thc flower and i swear by it and it isn't just because i know that hash rosin is supposedly better but it's it's also a lot easier to produce i mean once you've made it into bubble hash pressing that into rosin is not all together that difficult and you get amazing yields because you're already pressing the concentrate however you press flower that takes some skill and take some serious skill to get right to get get it so you're not having contamination to get the kind of clarity and quality that that i am getting off this this is a real serious serious thing that i do uh and i specialize in pressing flower rosin i don't have access to enough material to do hash pa it is what it is you know but i make real real decent flower rods this is garbage in garbage out the better the material i get the better the rosins bigger the yields every time okay so let's tilt this back up now readjust our our shot back out we're gonna put this back over here get our lighting right back where it needs to be let's bear with me a moment now you seeing this are you watch this [Music] oh baby look at all that beautiful medicine tell me that isn't just amazing the smell is incredible so pull it off of here again bear with me as i readjust lighting and move things around here me uh get back down to what you need to see now okay so there we go oh yeah pucks came out perfectly no blowouts everything went where it was supposed to go that's what i'm talking about so we have that and in that so i am going to just kind of give you two times look yeah that's a good good shot right there let's see what's going on and there we go got a nice glass jar here i'm gonna tear it on the scale so i know [Music] 26.6 okay so this is my favorite tool this is a skillet skillet tools um you can get them in kits you can get them singly i prefer these i think that they uh they hold up well uh they work well for me and just look at that beautiful stable gorgeous rosin that just gathers up real nice real easy indication of quality right there oh my look at that wedding cake oh yeah get you some of that look at that now if you are a pittsburgh area medical marijuana patient with a card and you bring me dispensary flower the higher the thc the better uh i will for free do this press it into google for you turning green into golden think of a lot worse ways to spend my time to tell you the truth this is therapeutic for me i love extracting it especially like medicated this is a lot of medicine right here picks right up hope i get it all in the jar i can tell you after pressing it yesterday waxes up beautifully overnight just at room temp room temperature cure in the jar waxes up amazingly excellent flavor immediate body effects from this strain for me okay your mileage may vary but quite honestly i am very very pleased with the results i'm getting from wedding cake and as long as it's around i will continue to get it just keeps producing okay look at that look at those highlights as you pull it across it's all gold copper and we got those and dripped off those two little jewels will just sit right there as we figure out what our yield was from this ounce all right quick calculation here okay here's here's the yield 32.81 32. minus the tare value of the container which is 26.6 6. and that gives us a yield of 6.2 grams and let's see i'll have to get back with you on the yield percentage because i shoot this video with my phone and unfortunately my calculator is on there too so we got 6.2 gram yield from 28 grams of wedding cake processed to 200 degrees through a 120 mesh micron screen thank you very much for joining me i want to thank crd for making excellent rosin presses at some of the best prices in the industry everybody's have a great thanksgiving stay

honestly there's not a lot of residue that gets on the banger you even want to overflows it's so much less than one actually gets an insert so it really does provide your banger from getting that like Chaz dusty look to it all right that was nice but next I'm gonna dab some rosin this strain is strong wah but number two from olio this one really impressed me even from olio it smells and tastes amazing the look on it's great honestly even when it smells it's almost [ __ ] clear let me show you all right I have number two get it nice and close time a little bit the smaller Deb but I still think it's a beige decent size with a desert no wait till it really starts to smoke up in here and then I go for it this one's a little hot oh my god Oh oh my god it's like one hit left boom Wow that [ __ ] is nice definitely burnt up though with that on that one oh my god there is nobody left in there even even when it was that hot it tasted [ __ ] good man these inserts really make the dabs last longer I sort of got I mean this time I went a little hot but even if you get a nice low time they [ __ ] Rock here alright threw down four to go [ __ ] alright next I'm dabbing on some good goog live president from Moxie I really like this drain it's a sativa hybrid but honestly it's just a straight sativa in my opinion it gets me so [ __ ] high in that like cracked-out sativa way or you're super chatty and like just want to go out and go do something like this is definitely a constraint for on-the-go I'm not gonna do a close-up on this one [ __ ] it let's see the whole function of the Ring all right let's drop it already Melton Oh Lord dude I'm already so [ __ ] big this is gonna be a long video yep it's gonna be a long video oh my god [ __ ] give me that little nose tickle oh my god I gotta hear at the chit still going Jesus Christ this is what I was talking about [ __ ] oh my god all right tap it out there I swear it man that is a straight sativa it's not considered one but like that rosin that killed me and that one's brought me back to life halfway there only three left alright next I'm gonna dive is a little scary it is like a straight THC a rock but it's actually just like lab rats and diamonds without the live presentation it it's one giant rock so this should be interesting this [ __ ] has no flavor obviously because there's no turfs but it just has this like weird chemi taste like I'm honestly just not a fan I'm kind of dreading this stab out of all of them because this is a giant [ __ ] rock of it but wish me luck this I do want to go in a little bit hopped out because since it's just straight THC a really all it needs is heat to get the full effect alright let's watch this [ __ ] melt so weird has just no flavor [Applause] a little bit left it holy [ __ ] alright it's done it's [ __ ] done oh my god dude I'm not even gonna lie there's so much replaying in here you know what that means cheers [ __ ] [ __ ] me oh this is all hot [ __ ] no bueno just has no flavor so weird the highs crazy on this stuff but it's just so weird now there's no Terps I need the Turks terms all right give me some turps next to reindeer the strong Nana I'd add this a bunch on my last video has like a super great banana terpene profile I love anything that tastes like banana I don't know why it's hard to come by and it always is just like such a nice experience when I get it and this is live rosin by the way so definitely gonna have a good Turkey in profile all right as well doing a close-up let me know if you guys are enjoying these little close-up insert drops actually really enjoy the inserts so I'll keep doing videos like this if you like it so let me know swinging a little hot on that gotta take a little breather there [ __ ] [Applause] [ __ ] me oh my god dude Robin just hit you different really does who love it great experience I'd love rosin rosin for life all right last but not least I'm going to do some only old life present my eyes are feeling heavy so I'm glad those videos under this drain is guava breath ever get what the number is let's go with guava breath to the number really never matters to me when people are like Oh what watermelon skittles is is the 16 or the 48 I don't care to that exact i honestly should but my memory is just not strong enough for that I'm like I know I like that strain or I like

that little intro man I got a bunch of goodies right here man and I thought I was just gonna smoke this by myself this weekend but why not make a video for you guys and let you guys know I think it's gonna be a review slash smoke sesh that's just vibing out man so right here guys I got some 710 labs live rosin some bootylicious number one it's tier two I just picked this up as you guys can see right here mint fresh super super super fresh might have already been taking add a bit too out of it but that doesn't matter because we got something else right here guys 710 lives of their 8th right here this is called oh gee KB and man I have heard nothing but good things from like their products man they the fact that 710 labs takes so much pride into the products that they all they do is just put in hard work and the results speak for themselves man they got people talking all over Instagram YouTube Twitter like I'm talking about like everywhere that I go everyone asked me as I have you tried seven ten have you tried seven ten and I've tried their hash rasen but I have not tried their what their Weed Man so I'm very very excited to get into this but for before we get into this man I have to give a big shout-out to today's sponsor man gothic comm where they sell bracelets pendants and rings super sick ass rings man well you can go buy some for your friends girlfriend whatever the case is man and you could use my own personal code savvy G to get a discount percentage of well I'll put everything down in the description below man go show them some support because a support of today's video guys alright honestly we're like I said I was ready to be smoking on both of these guys they both cost me around this one right here was $80 this one right here with $70 so a total of 150 it is a pretty hefty price to paint but you know if you want to smoke it you got to pay the price so we're gonna save this for the second part of the video we're gonna roll up a nice joint with that but first since I do have my rig right here MJ Arsenal and my torch all the goodies right here I think the only thing we can do is take it out all right so I'm already have been dabbing it so I'm bushed shut you guys in there it might be missing some so this right here guys is what I have currently right now and it's honestly some of the turkeys like 710 miles has to be some of the turkeys but I mean wax that I have ever smelled man like the the Terps in this thing is just so amazing and I kid you not man stabbing on Psalm endless like wax is just so freakin good man thinking about doing is heating this up for 30 about 30 to 35 seconds and then waiting about 45 seconds to 50 seconds I feel like that gives it the best the taste and it's not very harsh smoke yet you get very very milky clouds so let's go ahead and torch this thing up boys cheers i heated it up to 35 seconds I'm gonna go ahead and let it go till 45 just because I had you have the window open man and I'm gonna go ahead and meanwhile though let's go ahead and choose a nice little chunky one just to start things off boys because honestly I have I've only dabbed it once today and I feel like man this one's gonna catch me because I'm telling you the hatch frozen is so smooth that you only really feel it when it starts building up in your chest man so we're about during your second day and still got another ten and yeah let me know in the comments below if you've ever tried 7-10 labs man if you have make sure to hit that like button on this video and if you haven't we'll hit that like button anyways cheers boys oh dude that tastes so freakin good I already look at the depths what's already coming in that was the perfect dab I kid you not watch this I love waiting all right the reason I love waiting that much time it's because you just get the smoothest hits the milk is hits and then the Terps now I'm tick I'm talking about I can taste everything in this I can taste everything man it's phenomenal and after you're done your your nail should look like this man you should still see oil in there and man there's seven ten laps definitely definitely worth that's the $80 that I paid man I would I want to buy the Percy that one right there is $100 I believe or $90 so if you guys want to see a video on the percy live rosin let me know in the comments below like this video and subscribe so auntie dad dad got me super high and I just remember that we also have to smoke another joint so I'm probably gonna step aside from the dabbing and we're gonna go ahead and crack this open man this oh gee Kb your see you guys see how fresh it is man I have not opened it brand new look well you can see the seal right there man this is gonna be the first time guys that I have ever seen this flower in person and I'm kind of excited already it's like a little glimpse right there so let me go ahead and pop this sucker out oh dude oh now just follow my computer oh dude it's as beautiful as the oh oh my goodness dude yo I know my camera is not gonna you know pick up every single watch I'm gonna have to use my phone for this guy's but this but right here you guys know the phone camera picks up every single trichome everything that's why we use the phone and look look at this guy's just look at this you guys are gonna be in all all right so this is the og KB right here look at this dude the beautiful orange hairs I'm talking about look at the trichomes look at the purple little stems think you know oh my gosh the curation on this dude is just so phenomenal I haven't even smelt it what does it smell like I have never saw anything like this smells like me but it's just a different type of legal officer dude this is like literally one of the most aya peeling pieces of bud that I have ever seen and now it's just a fact so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna roll this up I don't know how much help I roll it up but dude this thing is just so phenomenal looking I don't even know if I want to break it apart but I just want to just put this in a casing and just put it in a corner of my room do you never touch it so this thing looks so phenomenal I'm gonna like I said I'm a roll up a joint and I'll see you guys in a little bit right here we got the joint right here man it's honestly I rolled there I've been getting so much better at rolling these freaking joints so all we got to do now man is pretty much just burn off the paperboys and basically here you go here you have it your perfect little or joint now I want to say there's like 1.5 in here man but does it really matter though because I just want to know how good this is man I want to know if it's worth the money because this this 8 was more expensive than a cookie so he hasn't gonna be the first one to find out boys choose only through the age of 18 or 21 whatever it is in your legal statement choose wood hmm after that personation I did get a little bit of some a little bit of paper tape so [Music] whoo it's actually pretty freakin smooth man so far so far I do i I did roll these in some raw hemp papers organic hemp so there might be another reason why but honestly so far it's burning a really really smooth I am getting a lot of earthiness from this plant itself and it's giving off a little bit of a sweet tone but honestly it tastes very very very good like it's something like I know we did we'd look I know we do sweet guys but you can tell the difference from something that is properly cultivated to some [ __ ] that you know that that is make that is being made in mass amounts and things like that like these guys they take so much pride because it's small batch all the time they never they never overdo the batches man because they want to make sure that every single planet that they grow is growing to a hundred percent perfection on their own terms you know but so far man I haven't I'll any clips of this this it's burning very very smooth like I'm telling you let me give you guys a little close-up of pilots burning right I rolled it really really good it's burning even all the way through you got the little tip right there if you ask them to see that and it's an enjoyable smoke man it's currently 10 o'clock in the morning and usually whenever this is the first time I'm smoking also unusually whenever I smoke first my eye like I started coffee or [ __ ] to him whenever it's the first work of a bit but this is smooth like I was saying and it tastes very piney earthy but it's enjoyable as heck I don't taste any really fruitiness flavors of it no I taste a little bit of sweetness but it's not overpowering this thing is chiefing though it's obviously getting me super super baby I ended up waiting a little bit after taking the dabs and then just I mean I rolled out the joint while I was high a [ __ ] and then I roll I waited a little bit more that way I could get the full effects because I didn't want to go from being a super stone because that was a super fat that that I just took I don't want to go from being super stoned to you know getting even more stunning I even being able to differentiate the type of high that I'm getting in the flavor because my mouth was dry as heck I kid you not that dad got me so tight but I was brick and faded for it for a minute I'm not gonna lie I have not been that faded in such a long time and it's such a good feeling now and then they finished chugging milk for sure all boys that looks like we're at had a lighter fluid on our centers [Music] this thing is McEnroe I hope you guys like the new location I mean I'm just in my garage and I hope you guys not like the current location man I was gonna do it in my car but I was like man for a special day like this my mind let's just do it somewhere where you know you guys can see all the smoke around me not the same setting give you guys some a little something different I just in used to Macanese well I'm about to finish this whole joint to the face but not on camera because that would literally turn my videos so freakin long all right guys so my review for this ogk be it's about its max I'm high right now like super faded and it's such a different height such a soothing high but usually with wheat it's either I don't get high or I get like you know too high to the point where I don't even enjoy the high because my head's hurting but this right here yeah but this one right here is honestly just hitting like every single aspect bro like I'm sure I know I know for a fact after I'm done with this I'm probably I'm probably gonna have a better good morning you know I'm already have me good morning gonna go better and EMA like like I would say though I would definitely would not mind dropping another 150 hundred 60 on some 17 laps again like because there I'm telling you they're rosin smack nice it was just the perfect gap the turf through there the taste is there that I was there everything about it was so good and I feel like usually I don't get that feeling with other concentrates you know with other flower so yeah man I would definitely purchase this again time though I do want to try the Persie rosin you know want to try I'm not even sure what kind of strain this was it was like an indica or sativa guessing it's either hinder guard hybrid so next time I want to try just a straight-up indica and see how much that smacks me because I feel like if this give this is smack at me right now I can only imagine what a straight up in meter with you so yeah guys I'm gonna go ahead and hand out the video here because I'm high as a hack right now I just want to enjoy the rest of this man hopefully you guys enjoyed today's video and you know and if you did go ahead and leave a like comment and most importantly hit your boat with that subscribe button and reach so let's try to get 400 K subs I mean 40 K subs boys that's the next call right and you guys are gonna help me do that guys so I hope you guys have a blessed day and we're out", "AORyULfIRe0": "yo yo yo what's good youtube welcome to another live stream i'm going to raise you up just a bit sweet so gopro updated and um my new wi-fi router is in we're showing signal strength here for the stream decent it didn't show that before so now that's pretty good to see anyways let me go ahead and share the link out to instagram and we're going to go ahead and get started uh all right cool well glad we got that up and running let me go ahead and uh get this stream up on my computer oh you're right let's see i'm sure you guys want to see some of this stuff that i have here before we even get started right let me show you what we got going on first of all we weighed everything out earlier we uh pulled it out of the freeze dryer fresh this morning fat fat nineteen point four percent yield killed it one thousand one hundred and thirty grams of nug went in 220 grams of full spectrum hash came out as well as 19 grams of 25 and 160 micron so this is our test press that we use for edibles and then we'll go ahead and press out the rest of these full spectrum pucks i loaded them by hand into the bags and then after putting them in the bags i pressed them down in a rosin evolution pre-press to make sure that they stayed nice and tight and they are evenly distributed went up from uh the small little four ounce jars and uh upgraded to the six ounce jars i got tired of filling those little small ones to the brim and i said it's time to upgrade baby so we got the jar all weighed out we'll be able to weigh this when we're done tonight and see what our final yield was on this run now i'm a big fan of doing my presses a little bit warmer than what most people would i'm using my stool for you guys today so i'm gonna do this but um yeah you guys that watch me often know i will press anywhere from 200 to 225 depending on the cultivar depending on the hash um not all hash comes out the same um for example we talked about trichome density before right we talked about just because it looks like a lot of hash it may not be a lot of hash because um the oil inside may not be full you know what i'm saying the trichome may just be partially full in that case it's fluffy hash where it looks like a lot but it doesn't weigh a lot that's why this 25 micron and this 160 micron it looks like a large puck but it only weighs 19 grams compared to this puck which is smaller in comparison by about a centimeter right and it's not as fat but it weighs more probably about five to six grams more and that's because this is the full spectrum 45 through the 159 which contains higher density trichomes that are full of milk oil compared to the 25 and 160. so just a little throw that in there for you interior genetics what's going on asteroid farms if you guys aren't following asteroid farms on instagram go follow so old homie of mine platinum grove colorado who used to have a really pimp-ass girl room the nasa lab right um one of the inspirations for me initially stepping up my garden well now it's his turn to come back and he just got a brand new house with a nice ass basement and guess what it's time for a brand new build out so we're gonna help each other out take some ideas off of each other and i'm basically gonna have him record the whole thing and um show you guys how he does his build out you know and he'll give you guys pointers along the way and uh you know show you how to build a grow room so by the time you know he's done with that uh build out i'll be done uploading my video on how when i built out my grow room and uh his will be pretty much part two of a series that i'm going to be doing where it's going to be either build-outs brand new or remodels or upgrades and you guys will be able to pay for each episode um individually and absorb all the information that went into that whole build or remodel so it was actually his idea and we're gonna do his build out as episode two so it's gonna be awesome it's gonna have amazing information in there and it's gonna be great for you guys because instead of just seeing my room all the time and you're like oh that's great but not everybody has your room like yours or not everybody has a layout like yours you'll get to see different layouts different places different um climates right you're gonna get to see it all and you're gonna get to see the different thought process that goes into building these so it's gonna be really cool but anyways go check out his instagram because he's already started posting updates on it and it's not often that you get to jump on board and watch it build out brand new from the start most of the time you hop in and it's like uh the person's halfway done they've already done a bunch of [ __ ] you kind of like feel like the new guy you know what i'm saying in a crowd of old guys that been around for a long time now's your chance to get in on the bottom floor be one of those old guys he's been there forever by the time he gets done finishing you could be like i was there when you were still drawing the blueprints yo whippersnapper some of this blue icy and then i'm going to glove up the press is set to 175. we're going to do a low temp press on our test bag it's not going to be a clear indication of how the full spectrum is going to respond but it's going to give me a good enough idea to know whether or not 175 is going to provide the flow i'm looking for or if i'm going to need to go up to my 204 temperature 202 maybe i will put a link up right now i'm not sure that you guys can do it that's what's up jinder mah what's up dude i haven't seen you in forever holy moly so yeah check out asteroid farms what's going on viper what's up slug upstate what's going on we're just giving everybody a minute to trickle on in taking dabs we're enjoying life i haven't even taken a dab with you guys yet have i ah let's take a dab i'm gonna go in on some of this blue icy first oh let's get in there who wants to get in those guts with me we've got 31 left on this battery oh let's get in there the gopro doesn't focus well close up so you guys are gonna take what you get and be happy all right first time catching a live stream viper you caught a very good live stream for your first live stream this whole live stream i've already prepped all my parchment i prepped all my bags normally i'm not this prepped normally i still have full parchment and [ __ ] i wiped down the plates i'm ready to go baby it's waiting on you guys i mean what do you think we're about to press a half pound of hash a half pound cheers at 413 on the email okay ah that blue icy i swear on the exhale it tastes just like a blue icy it is so crazy every time it never fails what's up easy labs green ranger nashville how you doing freshly pressed what's up annie oh gee what's up hidden creek we got the whole [ __ ] family here i think i'm gonna do a live stream prank and start a live stream pressing hash with the hair straightener so we can get a million people asking oh no what happened did the press break fantastic so huh all righty all righty all righty let's swap out the battery you already know we got it we gotta swap out the battery we don't want it to die it'll be another short live stream i had to find it i couldn't forget i couldn't remember where the [ __ ] i put it down now i can't remember which batteries are charged now let's see lucky number nothing they'd be lying sometimes you got to pull them out and pop them back in they're not lying tonight [ __ ] [ __ ] well one of you's got to be higher than 25 [ __ ] percent let's find out i i don't feel comfortable knowing i've got 25 percent left on the battery i just took a fat ass dab and i'm about to start pressing i'm gonna get excited forget and this is gonna die by the way if the stream does go down unexpectedly please stay tuned because i will bring it right back up this is a non-stop party tonight that battery was at 100 you [ __ ] lying ass charger all right all right so for those of you that are new here i do a [ __ ] ton in a very small space so this is where i'm going to be collecting at when i'm all done here okay we're gonna move some [ __ ] out of the way shout out to roz and inc i want you guys to look at something real close here custom product for who that is who has bags like that who has bags like that do you want to know why he carries these two and a half by four and a half bags hey cuz of me baby who wants some bags i know some of you press and some of you need some bags all right anyways we've got parchment laid out we've got our bags ready to go okay and here you guys are going to go you're going to go right here look at that just for you how's that view yeah you could just chill set you down now is a good time if you got to use the restroom you got to go grab a drink you know what i'm saying whatever you got to do go handle that let me figure out this lighting i don't want it to be too bright for you guys oh [ __ ] that's too bright all right i feel good about this you guys are ordering from rosin inc make sure you guys use my coupon codes they're on my site solventlessbnb.com let's get ready get up there get up there just a little love from my homie right there you know all right remember you guys we're gonna be doing the 160 micron and the 25 micron mixed together as a test press before we move on to the full spectrum presses here we have the uh [ __ ] puck come on turn on screen doesn't recognize my gloves oh well anyways i hope that you guys were able to see that now this uh this is just some uh edibles mix of some uh the last strain that i pressed out which is the grape cosby little dark but it is [ __ ] chirpy and delicious and it will do amazing for edibles because the flavor that it will add is not too over the top but it's definitely like you notice it notice it so we're going to drip this into that edibles jar this is probably not going to flow crazy this is a test press a low temp test press at 175 all right i honestly feel like i should go up a little so so so so oh that looks like it's gonna be good well i think i found the temperature i'm gonna try for the first full spectrum maybe it'll flow a little bit more i'll take it for edibles siezer um don't worry that was just a plate on top of the press jumping around my cold plate up there good extraction well the flow was okay wasn't quite what i want it's kind of a weird flow so all right well not quite what i'm looking for believe it or not 185 that's gonna give me that awkward drip i'm gonna hold pull my audience to see what you guys think the temperature is that i'm gonna go with i already know what i'm going with i'm gonna go with uh my usual all right well we're gonna go ahead and do the first full uh spec press now all the same size that one was at 175. small bag we'll do this one first oh jesus 224 no too high 202 202 202 that's that's where i'm feeling 202 today i can feel it in my huevos rancheros pressing some cool spectrum once cash baby all right the room temperature is 74 degrees i do not believe in running a cold room during the pressing stage now bear with me you guys this is going to be a tad bit awkward as i have to deal with not only the um press this new jar which is larger and doesn't sit on the edge so i have to hold it like this in fact i don't even know what your viewpoint is now does that make sense right there where it's at for you guys i mean all right here we go we're at 191.1 191.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 six that's how slow my press heats up i love it i don't care what anybody says it doesn't overshoot temperatures during pressing because it sleeps it heats up slowly it doesn't like jump up all crazy because it has some overpowered 150 to 200 watt heaters it just has two 100 watt heaters nicely spaced out let's take a dab again next time tomorrow it sounds delicious this [ __ ] is like caramel taffy uh oh uh oh ah excuse me i felt like my nose was gonna run all over camera i didn't want that oh yeah what's up mommy my [ __ ] that'll do good that'll do oh that gets the job done i'll tell you what how you guys feeling about this prize we're at 199.7 199.7.8.9 200. 201 i'm not there and dad just [ __ ] knock me on my ass about let's get ready to remove look at that still plenty of paper towel left to clean bangers with throw that away save that puffing my man it's a good night when my boy puffin comes to visit you're pressing yourself right now huh hell yeah get it dog we are warmed up to 202 degrees let's go this is gonna be a second test press slightly lower than my normal but for some reason i'm feeling this temperature why i saw gonza say 204 and i'm like yeah yeah that's my normal i feel it but then all of a sudden my balls rumbled and spoke to me from deep within and they said no 202 now they're all right [ __ ] it the balls haven't lied yet oh what would you look at that there already me gusta come here come to daddy a little [ __ ] go what i say i knew it i felt it i felt it in my huevos rancheros oh yeah let's get messy somebody's got to make a meme out of the next big bag that squirts all over this jar so i'm feeling good about that that's a fish grab that and we're gonna move this over here i'll turn you right now 202 my [ __ ] i want to know did i get it all did i oh man that was a beautiful extraction 202 good job balls sometimes it's in your brains sometimes it's in your balls tonight it was in my balls oh check your insta i just saw you let me see let's let's see what am i checking your story i don't know maybe i jumped in at the wrong part of that conversation oh elevated uh nah there wasn't a lot on the parchment there was barely anything in here really maybe like two to three grams that was a small piece of uh that was small and that was 19 grams in there and uh [ __ ] dude not a lot left in there it's all over the [ __ ] sides of this jar is where it's at you guys want to see a big squirt huh all right let's get it gotta get off this cyber dream stuff though um all right let's get it big old fatty this one feels like a 27-30-ish somewhere in there all right let's go i don't want to listen to trap sorry i gotta get i gotta get the right music on first this is bothering me put on some good old tj hotto all right let's go i'm gonna fold this one down the center i just pinch it crease it down the center diagonal the other diagonals and that gives you kind of like a good flow right there already and then you just pinch the sides together and it's like let me check my battery here 85 percent go dude i'm all smoking one squeeze okay shout out to my man mysticalgo my official artist on sbnb records back down oh yep bomb extraction on that one let's go cross mountain ranges split cells of tomorrow it flowed so well there's like not even that much on the paper let us go yes uh let's keep this party [ __ ] going good over here peace i think i put some information in the description maybe i didn't add that i guess but 25 micron double bag from rosin inc for the uh for the bags my bad y'all i tried to put some information in there and i left out that one yo if you guys can't catch the live streams sign up for my patreon i upload them there so come to daddy um is i'm the master of my own fate i determine my own yield i grew the flowers this is the source of the single i am my own god excuse you uh is that's why i keep the ends of these parchment pieces wrap them over the parchment paper i wish i could slow this down listen listen did you [ __ ] catch it though my man [ __ ] threw it in putting him on game yo understand he let y'all know i'm putting y'all on game for free i'm gonna i'm gonna take it back one time is it too loud uh um let's go ladies and gentlemen it's time to flow i'm gonna bring you guys back some i feel like i'm not bad hold on you guys don't really need that flashlight i don't think anyways let me take it off and passed wrench squad hold it down here's a pro tip on really fat pucks make sure you leave a little extra space behind the puck so that you don't get a blowout but i can mute it that's fine didn't need that light but i'm not liking how that's lining up on the [ __ ] plates i'm gonna move it over just a tad real quick like uh is i go go go go go real big extraction what is it [ __ ] this one's really done i'm calling it now it's gonna be a dumper is nobody [ __ ] with you you know what as a kid i actually did like origami and [ __ ] you know what was better than origami paper [ __ ] planes god damn it paper planes with a [ __ ] i could fold all types of paper planes you guys when i was a kid not now you know why i can't do it now because i lost the book i didn't look that [ __ ] up read that [ __ ] in the book you know what i mean books are cool as [ __ ] you can learn how to make paper airplanes and [ __ ] who would have thought mm-hmm starting to get good at this [ __ ] so um okay well brown is foreign i until you quit this next one's gonna squirt like a [ __ ] so um okay i have that camera ready i'm gonna record this one on my phone i'm not sure how i'ma do it watch me money money all the time hey money please no worries it's only 200 degrees touch it with your [ __ ] hands that sense sorry i'm trying to align this a little bit differently here safety reasons there it is my press has a ram that can adjust positions so um it's a little bit different than most the ram isn't stationary which means that it can come out of alignment sometimes if i move it or whatever but it's all we're helping to make good taking care of your summer projects is a breeze bam summer savings on all your favorite brands make things even easier so freshen up the deck and fire up the grill summer's here and it's as close as your home yard get more done let's get it i've used this prosper [ __ ] ever you're biking like five years now i just let go of the [ __ ] bar my bad you guys the camera is on a very unsteady amount kinda i don't have the tripod leg spread out very well all right is to the place whoa the puck slit in the plates when i was adjusting it apparently almost popped out of the front no blow out though but i gotta pull it out real quick and readjust it i'm so glad that didn't blow out but somehow that slipped out that's a trip i'm so happy that i didn't blow out that's crazy what the [ __ ] i've never had that happened that's a trip that's a trip son experience saved for real he wouldn't would he he [ __ ] would let's go back on the plates you go you son of a [ __ ] that was a trippy trip trippy trip trip this thing is about i was like why is it not going like it should be leaking way more and then all of a sudden the handle slipped and i was like what the [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] what happened put that back on the plate for a second up a let that so hmm who's your daddy who's your daddy what a safe uh is before oh yeah good extraction i'll take it oh yeah let's power through it two more to go parchment gets added to the jar everything i want everything together mixed together equal even steven the stuff that sticks to the parchment might be different terpenes might be different different [ __ ] you know you don't want to leave it out shop from the comfort of your home at sprint.com that's not a lot of work bro i know i'm saying it's already time to upgrade the jar again i just got this damn jar i'm upset it's not fun i thought for sure it was going to be good enough we knew get a bigger drawer uh bertha it's time to go squirtle what the [ __ ] it did it again something's going on here is it sliding something's happening here there's no blowout but it's sliding off pressure's not being applied evenly to the plates somehow or they're too tight or i pre-packed them at an angle never had this happen okay i know what i'm about to do fix this i'm going to have to increase the pressure even slower every problem there is a solution hmm leaned on him to apply pressure for the pre-press by doing it evenly i had to have been time to upgrade and put my bigger plates on i guess for these bigger presses right inside there i hope you guys are watching this if you guys aren't [ __ ] paying attention i don't know what you're doing right now when i mess up that's when you guys need to pay attention because i don't mess up very often not to sound cocky whatsoever but i don't so if i make a mistake that's resulting in some type of mess up it would benefit everybody around me to pay attention and realize what i'm doing wrong so i got my light that's fine before i make sure i got the jar underneath there i didn't think it was going to squirt like that still this parchment is heavy from the [ __ ] first part of the press but it's still flowing good that's all that matters and no blowout fan dumb strong on the top setting don't you get a damn hum my curl is my rocker maybe i choose you and i don't even have i don't even have um i have a couple theories for what it is lots of adjusts right now it's increasing pressure too fast and also i have the press at a a pretty good angle right now leaning towards the front and i think that the hash is melting and making the puck inside uneven and then it blows out the front like that so i think i'm just going to go ahead oops just hit the table i'm going to go ahead and flatten out the press a little bit more risky with this puck anymore how would i do on the save [ __ ] crazy giving her incredible so okay my battery at 34 okay um check the alignment of the plates one more me come on gloves don't stupid i know it's not that cold in here but then mm-hmm little 74 degrees in here oh missiles contemplating life changes foreign foreign let me grab some parchment hold on i got an idea not so much as an idea that i just want to do something for this press just insurance actually all okay searching for savings on descriptions is so complex it's like getting a documentary unfortunately you just savings period not all patients eligible savings so um me yes i haven't even hit one ton of pressure you guys think i'm kidding look so just hit two and a half oh figured it out right pressure was increasing too fast and the angle probably didn't know so so well aren't you guys glad i got the internet connections really good attraction well wow please so um batteries are charged let's get a battery swap in before we do anything else we'll go from there sound good oh think so okay all right so good job bertha good job baby we're gonna take a dab and then after this dab i'm going to um go ahead and collect what's on the parchment and get it added to the jar while it's still warm man that's heavy that's heavy i mean yield wise i'm thinking it's got to be it's got to be upwards of 80 it has to be you know there's it is no [ __ ] way it's not it's a little harsh didn't it that's okay i'll turn it down i knew there was a little [ __ ] nap thingy in here a little [ __ ] flew right on me else we know there's never a good time to run out of fresh luckily our delivery and free pickup excuse me so whether it's a few extra guns from the back all right i mean you can't help it i got lights on in here when i come in through the garage little [ __ ] just came in with me i guess oh boy oh what are we taking a dab off i mean this is the 160 and 25. this [ __ ] is looking better than some people's like 90s come on man this is my throwaway edibles what's your calling air force reserve af reserve dot com all righty i got the drugs already got a little bit of runs on here i'm gonna grab some more though on the outside of one of these parchments but i smeared i know there's like a bunch on the outside i could take so i don't have to dip into the jar or anything i'm i'm weird right now you're like call that fresh press man i wish i'll give you a melt so like wood that's runs wow wow that flavor is intense now that i haven't dabbed it in a while in a while holy [ __ ] it is intense um hitter hitter hitter hitter hitter goodness q-tip foreign all right fire all right here we go we're gonna collect the rest uh i don't have a tool i can even stick that far down into the jar to reach the bottom that's being 100 you guys want to get the girls so all right all right all right all right hash dust all over there packing the bags so all right you guys i'm going to turn up the music and i'm probably going to space out a little bit i have the chat right behind the camera though so i can see what you guys are saying and i will talk to you guys so

twice because this parchment doesn't have silicone coating on it get some cheap i am going to try it it's like clearly on top of the parchment paper it's like not sticky either is that's a trip whoa almost dropped the camera into the [ __ ] departure i forgot i wrapped the email coil back there well i gotta stand up for this because the you know coil is gonna drag across the table let's try this [ __ ] real quick oh yeah that melts that's pure thca holy [ __ ] [ __ ] how the [ __ ] i know i pressed it twice but what like it is so i'm taking a picture of that foreign doesn't have silicone that

dab so if you guys are prepped bad uh all right now this is the 160 and the 25. so so so and i'll give you an eighth edibles jar let's play with this one a little bit for animals oh yeah good color on that edibles is is so sorry i grabbed the tripod leg on it accidentally a little bit there paper towel snagged it out all right if you put in multiple guesses this is your only chance to go back and delete your other guesses and leave only your one answer i don't want there to be any confusion when people go back to look to see who won so everybody go ahead put in your final answer delete all your other answers that you may have put in when i'm done taking this dab we're gonna see who won", "qSFNG1uJIzk": "hey florida medical marijuana patients what's happening this is florida medical marijuana reviews bringing a review on one plant's live rosin that is fresh from harvest frozen plant that is pressed into beautiful beautiful rosin so essentially the strain is mac one i've torn into the gram quite a bit it has stayed perfectly together i don't feel like i've lost any terpenes since having it over the last 10 days it has stayed fully intact other than me of course dabbing the hell out of it the thc isn't going to be what a lot of people want it's of 72 roughly so i know there's a lot of people out there that think thc is everything so they may be slightly disappointed but let me tell you this product is on point true leave will sit there and tell you their rosings will give you a terp tickle slight cough it's just they have harsh shitty concentrate this right here will never give you a turp tickle this is immaculate now the reason this live rosin is 105 a gram is because it is lives when they harvest the plant they freeze it immediately and from there they prepare the trichomes for the pressing that's like one breath big dab i could not even feel the slightest of any kind of tickle in the entire thing granted i took a very low temp dab so some would argue that that's partly why it's not that hard even off a harsh hot dab i don't even feel like it's that harsh because this product is so clean now the only other dispensary out there that pushes a live rosin that is comparable is going to be move but theirs is a little bit harsher but this mac one strain from one plant absolutely out of the park indica i get just a little bit sleepy i feel like my body feels great on it now it does have a low cbd percentage a lot of people would argue that indica should have higher cbd percentages but with a live product like this i mean you get every terpene that was ever present in the plant from the start and i think that's exceptional i think for me that's a great medicine it tastes better it's cleaner", "Rh_dd_TqU30": "[Music] [Music] you", "1jFtPFQ8z9g": "to the people that are new to dabbing and see all these consistencies and get confused and just don't know which one to try i just say try them all today i'm going to be dabbing on some garlic cookie sauce from grassroots let's crack the seal on this as you can tell it's super [ __ ] goopy i'm gonna try to keep it as level as i possibly can jesus christ dude the whole room just reeks of garlic trying to do this without spilling any there's literally just like a straight up layer of turp juice on top of it we're gonna mix this up a little bit make sure all those diamonds and terps get mixed together nicely just look how gloopy it is you guys this stuff's so hard to handle on a dabber bloop but it's fire i love the function of this recycler that's the perfect little drain let's get our dab ready i'm not kidding when i say this stuff's running you guys you really want to make sure you have a dabber that has some sort of scoop on it so you can make sure you get a decently sized dab all right let's go you guys [Music] this [ __ ] is crazy you guys i know i talk about garlic cookies a lot on my channel but the aroma and the flavor that you get from this is [ __ ] nuts like that aftertaste just stays for so long the dab is gone i've already taken it but i can still just taste that insane garlicky feeling and these are some great effects too i swear to god that one dab does the job but this is some live resin sauce most people just call it sauce though it's a pretty popular form of concentrate there's a lot of different terms to describe extracts like shatter butter batter crumble sauce diamond sugar the list goes on and on these names are used to describe the consistency and the malleability of the concentrate not the quality everyone has a preference on their favorite consistency but none are just bad off of the consistency so just don't overthink it when it comes to quality of an extract it really just comes to what the quality of the product is going into it and the knowledge and experience of the person who's actually doing the extraction process it's not like chatter means bad sugar means good but sauce is a pretty popular form of concentrate if you've been to a few dispensaries you've probably seen it or if you know a few plugs they probably got it it looks like a million tiny rocks swimming in a pool of like yellowy ambery liquid diamonds are their own form of concentrate typically they're on the bigger side and much less terpy where sauce is usually super tiny diamonds sometimes there's a couple big rocks in there but usually it's so small where you really can't even see them mixed with a crazy amount of terpenes but those little tiny diamonds are where the cannabinoids are so that's where majority of the thc is stored and the liquid portion is live resin terpenes so there's a super high percentage of terpenes in there and a super low percentage of cannabinoids which is why it's perfect to mix the two so the sauce might not get you very high alone but when you mix it with those diamonds it just packs a punch you get pretty [ __ ] lit and the terpenes add an additional entourage effect so it really does add an additional kick to the thc but i say it's time to take another dab [Music] uh oh [ __ ] this drink feels so awkward to hold i'm not gonna lie oh my god that train is [ __ ] crazy oh [ __ ] those terpenes are always super [ __ ] heavy on sauce so i usually try to make sure i get the strains i like when i pick it up i know i said that they're all pretty much the same thing but the main difference between sauce and every other strain is that it has like the most intense terpene profile plenty of other concentrates of high terpene profiles but the most overwhelmingly high is typically sauce and the terpene profile on this one is [ __ ] insane it's five point seven percent mercy and almost five percent carry off i mean four point five percent limiting and that's just the top three it's total terpenes is 18.4 if i did my math right like that's a lot of terps sugar also has a high terpene profile but it's a little bit more easy to work with let me open this jar real quick and show you what it looks like for those who don't know all right this is a fresh gram of bubba kush sugar as you can see it's still terpy but there's more of like a solid consistency to it there's still some sauce in there but there's much bigger diamonds that are a little bit easier to handle and work with these two are made of exactly the same stuff but have a completely different consistency but the main downsides the sauce in my opinion or how liquidy it is like i just said you really can't keep it in a hot environment you can't put it on its side for a long period of time and it's hard to work with on a dabber at least if you like big dabs like using a little needle like this would be so hard even using a scooper like this you really can't get too fat of a dab but looks are deceiving with sauce and sugar in my opinion if you're used to just only dab and shatter and you really haven't experienced sauce or sugar like you really don't realize how fat of a dab you're taking if you just scoop up a giant bit of it but again not all sauce looks exactly like this sometimes sauce looks like a mixture between the two concentrates that just showed you where they have a couple big rocks in there but it's majority that like super small diamond but a lot of companies really aren't that great labeling this stuff i bought some sauce before that was just straight up sugar i've bought some butter before that was sauce there's a little bit of like subjectiveness that comes to it where they're like i mean it's sugar but it's super terpy so let's just call it sauce they do try to label it as accurately as they can so that you can get a good idea for what you're going to consume nobody likes pissed off customers so they try to make it as accurate as they can but i'd be lying if i said i've never had it be a little off but to the people that are new to dabbing and see all these consistencies and get confused and just don't know which one to try i just say try them all it's the best way to find out which one you like and which one you don't and it's like none of these are bad technically so you can try shatter you can try sauce you can try butter and you can see which one you like the best but i say we take one more dab before we head out of here this time i'm not gonna use the diver though personally this is my favorite way to dab sauce hey that's fire now that's the right way to dab sauce a lot of people message me and ask me to like clarify what consistency of concentrate they have it's mostly people that get it from the black market because it's not labeled but i feel like i might start a series where i go from concentrate to concentrate and just kind of show them off let me know if that's something you'd like to see in the comments below but click like if you enjoyed this video if you made it this far you probably did and leave a comment let me know if you want me to make this a series and if so what concentrate should i do next don't say live rosin i

popeyes chicken sandwich out here we got that boy out tropical sandwich hmm oh my god so good all right let's take a closer look at the haul we got today picked up some cards today I got a Maui wowie and an OMG push cart and these are both half gram card sleeves that regular 510 C cell card I should have some batteries that go with these I got a gram of some rosin and this is a strain called guru and it's some dry sift rosin the blood tender was recommending this strain and it looks really nice I didn't get to smell the concentrates in there which isn't always an option but this was actually about the same price as the most recent gram of rasa and I got in Colorado so not too far off on price there which is interesting for me and I picked up an eighth of some lemon Margie here we got some nice flour here this was one of the better options in there they did have a few but this one looked like it had the densest in the frost yes bud so I went with that and I really liked the smell on this one it's really good stuff and then I also grabbed the grandmas of shatter here I picked up a gram of candy Margie and this is some move shatter it's an ethanol extraction and this is like really good looking stuff I haven't seen too many ethanol extracted shatters but this [ __ ] looks really good well I can't wait to dump these let's see what they taste like alright it's time to try out what we picked up here I'm gonna do some cold start dabs off this Cactus Jack rig I got this from hem Perko and you can actually get 5% off the whole hem Perko website with the Cubans code I'll put a link below but we're gonna do some cold starts with this guy here I'm gonna use this skill tools dabber here this is the skill tools flexing and I'm honestly used to hundreds of bad tools in my life and this is the best one it's got like a very precise flat tip that kind of curves so you can you can get just the right break or just the right scoop on any concentrate I'll put a link to this because this is honestly I've gone through hundreds and this is the best job til everyone should that one they're like 10 bucks let's break off some of the shatter we're gonna load it up in the nail for a cold start really good shatter consistency all right let's see if I can load this up in here yeah just Lakes off let go so we got our shatter in there we got our turk pearl stuck in there let's rip this bad boy [Music] [Music] I actually want to hit another dab of that shatters so let's get a big scoop on their car else let's [ __ ] this one up oh there we go dang oh that's it going [Music] Jesus and they fit [Music] the shadow tastes good but this will ring really [ __ ] rinse let's scoop some of this rosin I want to do another nice cold start of that now I mentioned this was about the same price as the last grammar Oz and I got in Colorado but I actually got I think new 25% off now I think about it's always cheaper never mind never mind I'm okay we got that the rosin scooped in here bad of excited to try this one only [ __ ] yeah yeah that one's much better [Music] the flavor on that one versus a shatter is crazy [Music] hmm well that hits really nice alright let's break into these nugs here I got to see if this lemon Margie is any good smells so good we add a nice bold pack there that looks like a nice one alright let's take a rip of this lemon Margie [Music] [Music] [Music] did you see that ghost what the [ __ ] all right don't ghost your heads I'm just [ __ ] around [ __ ] that was good it went down so smooth that I was like [ __ ] it ghost it it wasn't harsh it

to sit down with pyramid today and review their pineapple chunk live rosin pax pod it is great as a quick disclaimer as a part of our protocols we check everyone's temperature and do contact tracing so this interview was conducted without masks just wanted to explain that we're trying to keep everything above board so it's nice and safe for these interviews all right watch on thanks for joining us today i had the pleasure of reviewing pyramids pineapple chunk hybrid solventless rosin pod these pods are 100 hash rosin which makes the flavor profile and effect vastly superior to other ones out there that i've gotten to try the pineapple chunk is a really nice hybrid very middle of the road effect wise and you would expect it to be pretty fruity but in this case we found that it was really hashy when i was smoking it it really reminded me of some old-school bubble hash that we used to put on bolt hoppers so one of the coolest things about these pyramid pods is that they're actually taking advantage of paxpod's smartpod technology which means that when you connect it with the app on your phone it's going to tell you all kinds of cool things about the strain but that it's also got pre-loaded temperature settings right onto it so if you take a small rip it's going to run at a very low temperature preserving your terpenes or if you really want to go for it it can also ramp the temperature up so you can blow a huge cloud overall this technology is really really cool so the color is really nice the effect is not going to put you to sleep it's not going to get you up and excited it's a nice mid-time day high that you can kind of just ride out wherever you're going and like i said before the pineapple notes are pretty minimal what you're really getting in this card or at least what i found was a lovely hashy kind of sweet flavor that came through and just boosted my day it's a nice break from whatever's going on in your day at that moment and it's really easy to consume with these packs of vaporizers eric here with peer pressure really excited to have pyramid on the show we're going to do some intros and then start talking about hash canvas processing everything and then we'll start talking about these products so let's start off with jake tell us a little bit about yourself hey eric thanks for having us today um yeah my name is jake berry i started pyramid with my business partner coley walsh about six years ago now um i moved out here originally from texas after graduating from college and i um started off as a button in the industry um that was my first gig here and i quickly realized that you know what i really want to move into the extraction side of things and we i really saw a niche there that i feel i felt like we could kind of build a brand around now um at that point vape pens were really just getting started and it quickly became one of my favorite ways to smoke as a blood tender and i just saw the growth happening and you know coley was actually my boss at the dispensary and you know talking to him i was like hey why don't we why don't we look into this why don't we why don't we do this you know i feel like i can find the funding for us to do this and get this up and going yeah and um so we did we started looking around for different licenses and back then i mean it was nightmarish to find a new thing um you know to get into the industry was very difficult and [Music] just googling and going through different municipalities web pages i found the city of we ridge it was the second city i called um and asked them about it and it turns out they were having a lottery within 30 days so um it had just been announced and like happenstance it happened to stumble upon it started applying for and doing the application i had never done something like this in my life um and kind of had to quickly figure things out at that point cole and i were both still working at the dispensary while trying to do all this on our days off finished the app got it in and happened to win the lottery and here you are and here we are now that's incredible uh and matt tell us a little bit about yourself uh what got you in the industry and what do you do at pyramid i'm matt cease i'm the lab manager at pyramid i've been there for about a year and a half now i got my start out in the garage my cousin was growing and he just needed somebody to do some extractions unfortunately butane none of that was like an option so it was all just bubble hash and rosin started with a hair straightener and five gallon bubble bags and it's just grown from there wow cool so in your role as the lab manager at pyramid what kinds of extraction and processes do you oversee now supercritical co2 okay all the ethanol post extraction the winterization distillation we run white film and also overseeing all the solvents cool okay and you guys are mainly focused on bubble hash and rosin you guys do any sift we don't do any sift unfortunately we tried to do sift in the beginning but all of our product just kind of came out dark okay so not the way you guys wanted the route we wanted to go okay cool so jake you started as a bud tender now you're running your own company with coley does it look like being the ceo of pyramid put us in your shoes running a cannabis company what does that look like um you know i think a lot of people think it's this super glamorous job and you know it's actually a lot of work um you know i would say both of us um you know we're five years in now and we're both probably averaging 60 to 70 hours a week typically um you know i wake up at 6 00 a.m i am at work no later than 8 30 and i stay till you know six seven sometimes and so it's a very busy um job and uh but it's super rewarding and that's the great part like i go to work every day and i love my job and so i feel like i hit the lottery like the hours don't matter you know it's super enjoyable um but it's just it's also just exciting like everything like my feeling and my favorite part personally is launching these new products you know getting into uh the solventless side of the thing like of the industry was something very interesting for for me to do in launch this is just my favorite like parts of being the ceo is saying you know giving the company a vision and saying look this is where i see us going this is something that i think we want to do and launch you know and not everything works out you know you can definitely have those you know stinkers happen but um the rising line is going well you know it was something that we really wanted to get into and it's going great and similarly to us going into michigan yeah you know so no that's awesome and you know for a follow-up to that you know what are some of the pieces of advice that you would give to someone who wants to be a cannabis business owner you know what what would you offer to someone who's either trying to get into it or is at the very beginning stage you know now you're five years deep you know um don't get intimidated it's a very very intimidating um experience you know i was 23 when i got into the so you're very young yeah i'm 29 now um and it's very intimidating especially if you don't have a lot of that you know experience and background but just be confident and and continue to stay humble throughout the process because you're going to get hit honestly like along the way so just kind of like keep persevering and working hard and you know don't focus on the little things you know there's a lot bigger fish to fry in the day and like if you get caught up on every everything along the way you know it's you're never going to get there so just focus on what on your goal and and keep working towards it and eventually it'll happen well it sounds like you've built a good team around you you know are there any aspects of team building or like you know bringing on the right lab manager to do the work is there anything that's worth mentioning there definitely um the industry is an interesting place to work in um you know there's a lot of bosses out there that you know might not connect with their employees i think um and so it kind of goes back to that being humble part that i was mentioning yeah you know start this and and work hard towards it but build that relationship with the people you work with you know i'm no i'm nobody in this in the grand scheme of things you know like i i'm more showing up to work every day and working and you know i want to hire people that want to come to work every day that are happy and excited and can feel like that they can connect with me more you know they see me working every day yeah so hopefully that inspires them to also come here and work and show up and so hiring the right people is super key yeah but keep that family mentality um and that's something that i learned from my parents you know and like my culture of just keeping that cohesive bond between everybody and so you know i try to say hello to everybody whenever i come to work every day and um and um i would say people should do that you know if they're looking to start something yeah so word of the y's for everyone who's listening uh pay attention to your company culture obviously that can make all the difference honestly it'll make it break you your company culture is so so important um you know like our christmas parties are like my favorite thing to do every single year it's like we play good yeah we play um white elephant and it's just fun it's it's a good time to let loose everybody to just kind of poke from each other and that's the other thing don't take yourself too seriously i really don't take myself too seriously i mean look at my you know joke around with people you know have those experiences and and be be relatable once you think you're better than anybody else you're gonna very easily no longer be able to succeed especially in this industry yeah so no that that's great advice matt you know to shift gears a little bit tell me about what a day in the life looks like of you the lab manager managing all these different processes all these extraction methods and then you know solvent lists at the end of the day being perhaps your top shelf product you know what what is what does a day look like for you it is extremely busy i'll start off by saying that that's true everything has to be done very very particularly like very peculiar with everything that's done cleanliness i mean just that alone takes up a huge part of the day a lot of people don't focus a lot on that but anything that your product touches it gets on your product it's in the end product people are smoking it it's just not good for anybody but the lab starts off you know you turn the lights on you fire up all the machines and it's just making sure that nothing's broken first so like a lot a lot of our equipment's running overnight with a super critical co2 extraction you know matt is constantly like reloading the equipment setting it up for running it and then he has to set up a run for overnight so you know in order to kind of reach our goals and and keep up with the production of all of our sales you know he's got to be on point all day long you know a lot of people think that it's just kind of come to work and get high and hang out and no and that's like ass buster yeah yeah it's unbelievable yeah that's not the industry you know and so um if that's what you think is happening here you know that that's not the case you know everybody who works for a pyramid works incredibly hard and um you know and and we try to keep that environment going for them so we get in the lab turn on the lights make sure everything's still functioning properly and following that it's redoing the process that you did the day before all of it's the most labor-intensive job i think i've ever had i really i have a hard time even describing like where i start and where i end but it's always changing too it's like and there's always a new fire there's a new problem every single day that you have to solve it's like being a detective a mechanic and then a scientist you're definitely not a scientist right away you're not a chemist you come in and it's okay what's broken all right let me pull out the wrenches let me pull out the tools let's fix this machine and then as you're fixing that machine chances are something somewhere else is just not going perfectly so you bounce around the lab constantly it's like a ping pong ball and then introducing solvent list to our line actually kind of let me slow down a lot the process is much more much more connected i would say like actually getting to wash you know you're in touch with everything in tune with everything and then when you get to the rosin press it takes finesse throughout the press isn't something you go up to and go and pull the handle and get beautiful rosin it's actually a lot of finesse a lot a lot of finesse well that's really interesting and you know talking about connecting with the plant connecting with solvent lists you know why did you guys bring solvent lists on in the first place and i i'd love to get both of your perspectives on this i mean i'm sure you were advocating for it as someone who started off doing ice water hash absolutely no it was mainly the quality you can't you can't reach the uh the terpene profile on anything else in my opinion than you can with live rosin it tastes so true to the plant and it brings me back to kind of like the original days when i first started smoking weed it has that real true wheat taste when i smoke some concentrates they almost all taste the same to me a little bit like vho co2 extractions there's slight differences but each strain has the same particular taste to them with live rosin i've noticed it brings out way more of the flavors that you don't originally notice yeah and i would have to agree with him completely there you know i remember when i first started smoking you know a long time time ago now um it was so exciting to like experience the next the next bag the next pickup you know and um and just try something new and fill a different experience yeah and i i i kind of agree with what matt's saying is concentrates you can definitely notice the self differences but i think a lot of it's harder for people to with certain things that you just with rosin especially with live rosin um it's extremely pronounced exactly essentially and i'm immediately pronounced um and you know everything every wash is different and you know and kind of going back to original question you know yeah you know matt was pushing for something you know and coley and i at the same time we're looking for kind of that we wanted that high-end option as part of our portfolio of different things that we offer and um with our relationship with pax and just like our vape experiences we felt like we could really kind of bring something new um and you know we wanted that that option so it was kind of a mixture of you know matt's experience with bubble hash prior to and saying you know this is something that's becoming a thing me kind of realizing that it's on the come up as well and uh saying you know what let's produce this new high-end product um for our consumers so that's awesome and you know when you're thinking about making a solvent-less product as the lab manager what are you trying to look at is it you know intense strain selection are you guys sourcing specific things from your own garden you know walk me through a little bit how you select the strains that you do that you decide to wash and process mostly it's trial and error unfortunately we do small test washes on things if we need to find out what the yields will be and stuff like that from our grow you know we had some really good things like cherry cake wedding cake uh we've been running this pineapple chunk that we were just playing here today was something that that yielded on the really low side unfortunately but the quality of it is just so good that yeah you can't had to go for it you have to yeah and uh yeah and and i guess you know i i do a lot of the sourcing in the material okay you know um and we've attended some of y'all's classes actually and um and and heard advice from you all you know you guys are the experts honestly at the end of the day you guys have been doing this for a long time and that kind of moves our strength selection um to a certain degree and but finding those relationships of those quality growers is difficult you know and so we have a very small grow um and uh our product typically that comes out of there washes really well i think a lot of that's attributed to the growing style and the lights that we use we use three fifteen watt leds we've got flour under them and the turkey profile comes you know at the end of flowers really really good and so um yeah the yields are very low but transferring that flower into rosin um it tends to come through exceptionally without it rises brings the quality up that much higher yeah that's why i personally believe i mean i noticed it on our other extraction methods as well is that um the lights matter so much um you know from outdoor to greenhouse to you know uh hbs lights to um lec's um there's such a unique difference that you kind of noticed from being in the industry for so long um and but otherwise yeah you know i mean we can only provide a little bit amount of what we produce so we've got to go to outside sources and find and make those relationships with different grow facilities that can provide us that high quality material so and when you get some high quality material that jake has said you know hey man we're getting the strain in you know let's go for it how do you guys decide which solidless products you're going to turn it into for example you know we've got pax pods with us we've got some grams of some live rosin you know do you make a determination beforehand of where you want that material to go we just started doing the grams so it's not even we haven't released it to the market yet all right everyone exclusive coming out in the next couple weeks realistically so we're actually going to start running and pressing a lot more than we have been um to release these these grams okay so it's been pods first and now we're getting into grams yes sir cool and how what what does that look like are you guys thinking about pretty much just doing live rosin uh what what does that release look like it'll just just be live rosin um the big thing is we haven't really gotten to do too much testing on making sauces or batters and what we're going to do yet whether it's going to be just a crumble uh it's going to come fresh off the press so we still have to work out some kinks there i'm guessing it probably some r d that went into getting these pens right um yeah absolutely yeah that was a huge struggle i mean figuring all that out and pins are not easy like yeah hey no we can be honest about that and you know i think everyone who's tuned in and watching now you know we're not here to tell everyone that making a rosin pen is something that you can just pick up and do on day one so for the rosin pens specifically what were some of the hurdles that you guys went through to now come out with what is an award-winning product getting everything off the press and out of the bags like washing is super easy doing the rosin press was super easy getting the actual oil into the carts and the pods and getting them to flow correctly and hit correctly was by far the most part like the most difficult part that we had and that's just the viscosity getting you know getting the viscosity i mean as you know when your first comes off the press most of it's still thca so it's going to crystallize it's going to butter up and in order to flow in a cart you need it to be liquid so it has to be de-carbed back into thc and when you're doing that there's just there's a lot of problems that can arise so it took you guys definitely some trial and error uh some missteps but now we're at a point where you guys have a product that it looks like you're super proud of absolutely yeah you know and i i think you know some of the to expound on what matt was saying is the terpene retention you know what do people want out of rosin they want it to taste it's amazing the best product they've ever had closest to the plant yeah getting that right on that post process after the press is so integral to like what we do to make a quality product and i mean that took him long long time to figure it out uh just to keep that terpene retention and then beyond that yeah filling is is a whole different thing this isn't like this you know i can't crank the heat up and pump it in a cart yeah and have it flow well you know and so um there's still trial and error in that you know it's like you gotta it takes a while to really dial it in and um we feel like we've gotten into a pretty good spot right now obviously we release the product but there's always ways we can improve upon our process so i'd love to hear from you matt you know you said that this was one of the first pens that you guys made and it won an award tell us a little bit about the trophy we've got on the table here and what the story is behind that one yeah so this was a face-off og it was actually our very first wash in our new wash machine it was our very first time on the rosin press first time trying to de-carve things into a cart so there was there was a lot of lost face-off og grams yeah i apologize to them but um yeah it's it you know it's a really difficult process but we're here today you know we got everything dialed in yeah that's that's a cool story yeah considering it's our first watch we're i mean we were surprised when it came through you know it was it was something where we were i mean i i think i was pushing that we were in the middle of developing this product and release and we wanted to get it in before um this competition and you know i was you know on the back of matt saying get this going let's go let's go let's let's be let's enter this you know hopefully we'll something good will come out of it and it happened to and it happened to be his first wash which is ridiculous in itself but super happy no that's awesome to see you guys hitting a home run like that tell me a little bit about your relationship with pax you know we've got some products here you guys are putting your rosin pens in pax pods uh walk me through that sure um so we've been a pax partner for i think going on two years now two and a half years um and we launched with obviously our other products and pax you know provides the hardware provides the battery you know the actual pod system but you know everything that's inside of that you're smoking is is directly from us or any of the other partners that are on the platform um we there was no rosin on that platform at all and that's where we really saw like a good way to to get in and you know we wanted to launch this so this is actually the first rosin pod packs anything um in in the market in colorado no just in nature nationwide yeah this is the first rosin pax pod that you can consume very cool um and so we saw that kind of that lane that we wanted to get into that we kind of went along with our goal of you know having a really high end product that we could sell and we figured pairing it with like our packs you know distributorship was a really good move and so that's kind of how we got there um but yeah you know these things aren't the same either you know like a 510 cart is much different than a pack spot and we have different feeling techniques for each of those options um and so there's a lot of r d on that back end too that like our production manager aaron really had to play around with to figure out how to make these work well you know you don't want someone to get a product to try it and not work and so figuring that out was was difficult yeah so you and aaron were working hard to bring these products here today all right so we've got pineapple chunk rosin on deck both in live rosin pax pod form as well as grams uh how did this strain fall into your hands it starts off in house with our grow and then i hand select the nugs that we're going to use to wash we hand wash i don't advise anybody to use a drill in a paddle it's just just don't do it it's not worth it it's going to waste your time following that we throw them in a two and a half well actually we from there we select which trichomes are going to be the best to press you don't want to just i mean you can mix all of your all of your bubble hash selections together but you're not going to get the greatest quality that you could by selecting which trichomes are better which in this case was the 90 to 120 micron range following that selection they go in the freeze dryer we freeze dry them yeah and then we load them up in two and a half by nine pure pressure bags set them on the peer pressure pike's peak version yeah and we press it around 180 185 degrees i like to press until the oil will start to darken up or pretty much you can tell by as you're adding pressure you'll see possibly the oil darkening up a little bit i like to stop right around that point yeah and that's a lot of trial and error though i mean yeah it varies honestly not even from strange terrain each press will vary like i said it's a lot of finesse when you're working the press it's not something you just pull the handle and you get your perfect oil but so there's some trial and error there you know as far as the grow since you know we talk so much about growing and how important that obviously is for all forms of extraction but especially solventless tell me a little bit about your grow and you know how you guys got a product this good yeah so um all the genetics we've gotten have been from growers around uh colorado um we fl we we grow in a deep water culture system so we use a current culture system um and then we fly under 351 lec's we really feel like the end product while you might not get as big of yields like you know bigger buds we definitely get a higher quality product like in our wash specifically or in our extracts because we don't really sell any weight um all of it goes right into our process um so we either process it into our you know distillates or we process it into our co2 oil or now a lot of it's going right to fresh frozen so um you know the harvest is very very important really knowing what you're doing there is it is key to making the wash go well um you want to harvest right away you know a lot of people think that oh it's okay to you know buck these buds and let them sit here while i finish this harvest no you want to go very very quickly and go um on a plant my plant basis almost um you know you really don't want them to be sitting around for any more than 20 30 minutes so wow so it's a quick d fan um you know all right in the stock and then you buck the buds very quickly um everything we cure is in turkey bags typically and that's kind of what we do for our fresh resin as well so you know pluck buck bag and throw it in the freezer immediately it's very important um to not get too much water cotton content because it definitely will affect the wash on the back end oh so you guys have it nailed down that was almost like a little limerick i i like that so we've got pineapple chunk with us what are some strains that you guys like to smoke start with you matt i've got a weird palette personally one of my favorites right now is mandarin dreams i absolutely love that strange i mean it just sounds nice i also love bananas anything with banana in it is always a go-to for me and then cheese bio cheese any kind of cheese uk cheese i love cheese cheese okay cheesy terms i can't get enough cheese that's awesome what about you uh you know i'm big on the cheese game too um cheese quake is like one of my favorite strains ever um i haven't seen her around in a long time um i don't know how little washes we haven't gotten a chance to watch something like that but i also really like a lot of sub cool genetics personally um so like space queen is amazing crossed with anything jelly bean nine pound hammer jelly beans my favorites hands down yeah and um that's one strain that i really want to wash um and so that'll be coming in the pipeline too awesome so that's kind of yeah that's my favorite strain we're gonna do it at some point okay okay that's right i think you get a decision in there you know i would also love to learn you know before we right before we get into the review here you know let's wrap this up with tell me a little bit about what does pyramid stand for like what are your guys's philosophies um you know it's a very difficult question especially put into words um you know when coley and i started out we you know we were just trying to to get get things going and you know it was really hard to to kind of figure out what we wanted to stand for as a company and you know i think the biggest thing that kind of we look for and and that we want like our message to be is we just want to be a good place to work you know i feel like a lot of people are very unsatisfied in their life and and we want people to enjoy coming to work with us you know not for us but with us on this and so you know beyond that um you know personally like i really like um kind of able to you know expand upon my heritage and and show that you know minorities can be successful in this space um and uh and so i think that's something that we really have going for us there is um anybody can can get into this you know it doesn't have to be one person the other so you know we really are interested in in working with communities of color yeah um and you know that's kind of one of the big things we're doing in michigan specifically we're working in a um kind of a lower income area and bring jobs bring jobs to those areas you know bring business back into these areas that have you know over time have have gotten the shorten the stick here um and so you know i i wouldn't say we have a you know i'm not the marketing guy who's gonna tell you this is our philosophy this is our mantra sure i think it's more of just like inside of us yeah this is kind of who we are as people and we want this to come through on our business side as well so yeah that i mean that's a great explanation jake walk me through what do we have on the table here uh and what are we gonna review so today we are going to review our um pineapple chunk live rosin pods um we don't have a rate today so we'll kind of just let you guys look at bigger hams um and then we're also going to kind of show you guys the newest tech coming out of packs that a lot of people have not experienced or seen yet cool um and so i'll kind of review through that real quick okay yeah please show me break it out um all right so you know pax right now um just released this product it is the pax era pro they've added a lot of really cool tech into this product that is is very new uh i love the packaging to start off with yeah and then honestly the feel of it is is it's it's really premium you know i think pax really wants to be that apple of um of uh vaporizers and i think magnetic lid yeah all right they've put uh they've put some thought into this okay and even there you know yeah shows yeah very well thought out packaging um i really like the new finish on the actual product um and they've done a lot of different things with it now so you actually get some color options which didn't exist before okay um so we've got silver we've got a red a jade and a traditional black i like the silver a lot nice um very clean yep so they've added usbc um charging to so they've kind of upgraded the charging it's fast charged so um throw it in your car you know or you take it out to a hike and it's not ready it's gonna be ready weight is almost nothing which is very cool very cool um and some of the features they've added to it are really nice um they have the traditional child proof usage on here you know you connect it to your phone yeah and it's going to be child proof so your kid can't can't mess with it which i think is a really awesome feature for a lot of people totally um and then some of the what i really like though is that so if you look at all of our pods you really wouldn't really notice it let's crack one of these up real quick please i was hoping we might um okay so yeah so this is our packaging so we really wanted to go with a more um hash head feel to it yeah if you you know we want it to be we really like our packaging to look fun yeah and that's kind of the direction we're going with a lot of things and so we wanted to kind of give you that rosin feel to it that that fresh press and that's kind of how we came up with this yeah with the director this it's very different for us um and so inside the child proof packaging you'll find a a pot obviously pull it out check it out all right and now you are saying child proof often i want to make sure just pop this baby right in there oh it's vibrating and lighting up so no it knows yeah that's another cool feature is the haptic feedback um so you know you plug it into your new era pro and it will vibrate you know like hey this is this is so is this primed and ready to go is there anything else i need to do here uh no go for it okay cool these are very childhood yeah good you guys you guys got your packaging down and you know as a marketing person i'm i'm very appreciative of aesthetics and uh this this got some to spare so you can definitely take a hit um there's three different settings that we load on these pods so these pods are actually smart pods now so tell me what does that mean smart pod okay so in-house so we what we do is you know we fill the pod and then we tag them okay so whenever you buy a new pod it'll have this red band around it when you pull it into your air pro and you have your app on your phone it'll literally show you like this is a pyramid pod so it'll have our logo okay we'll get the description of the strain it'll tell you the potencies so you know that's one thing that i hate about you know our 510 carts is like you forget what you're smoking a lot of the time so you know we have it engraved on the pod but also when you plug it in it's going to give you description of the strain um and then beyond that um we have an expert temp that we set it to and then you also have a load temp automatically set in a high temp so if you really want that high vapor production with you don't care too much about the turbine preservation yeah you can bump it'll bump up automatically or you can set to like our typical temperature so where am i at right now um you know i think you're probably right in the middle okay realistically because voltage obviously very important part of getting a good grip with a solventless pen specifically and usually lower voltage lower temperature you know if i'm going to spend the money to really get a premium vape i'm not just trying to cook all my terps well i think that's a huge benefit to the pax platform is that you know if you're you know if you're that hashtag and you're looking for that really high quality product using a 510 card is usually not gonna get you there um unless you're using a very expensive battery to get there yeah where this really allows you to dial in your high um and dial in the experience you want to get you know we can take it really low and you're going to get that really good flavor almost like a dry vape yeah um but you're not going to get that that that big cloud so typically i like to pump it up a little bit okay um to get that experience right away well i've sat and heard so much about this strain let's [Music] hmm that's really good i mean it it's interesting because with a vape sometimes you never kind of know what you're gonna get and there's a lot of information there's a lot of education and you know especially with the vape crisis that was you know in full swing last year like having a real nice solvent-less vape like this i i really like the experience especially the rosin experience um out of this i mean it's really hard to replicate a true dab in vape form i think that's what what people criticize vape a lot for yeah people want the convenience especially the purists the purest yeah you know they kind of hate on vape a lot and we're really trying to get these p get those individuals who want that high quality product yeah onto a vaporizing platform and that's what our raw our live rosin pods do especially on the pax platform yeah you know just kind of taking this experience in you know it's it's fruity but it's also got something else behind it like it's very smooth and sometimes some of the really high terpene fruit strains that they're not quite as smooth as what i'm getting in this and you know kind of as it's starting to settle in a little bit and i know you know i didn't blow some monster cloud for everyone on the camera but just you know really enjoying you know having a fine vape it you know for me when i consume it it's not always just about flexing on our video it's about really just having an experience with the products itself um yeah it's great i mean honestly this is the closest you're gonna get to a dab in a vape form um no [ __ ] um i don't know if they can say that but no [ __ ] it's um we could square on our youtube channel this is for adults uh and um it's really good and i i this is pretty much all i smoke now honestly on our platform is our rosin line yeah um just because i think the flavor profile is unmatched among vaporizers and um it's always interesting to try something new yeah so well if i could describe you know after taking a couple hits some real small ones some bigger ones i mean it's fruity i get a little taste of pineapple in there there's almost something in there that is a little more savory and i'm having a hard time putting my finger on it but there's there it it's a strain that's got some depth and i like that um and as far as like the actual experience goes of using this it's it's very seamless um i'm a big fan pineapple trunk great choice on this one you guys uh i just want to smoke this all day this is a tough one well i'm glad you like it you know um we'll definitely get you some samples of some other strains to enjoy and um yeah i'm really glad you're experiencing having a good experience this is a great product thank you guys so much for coming in uh you know the review today obviously the sullivan's pax pod but for those of you out there who also really just want to take a dab and that's the experience you want to have we've also got grams here as well and you guys are going to be doing limited drops of those starting soon is that right yeah yeah that's a plan you know it's been a really popular option and so you know we definitely know that the consumers that are most interested in that are looking for those super premium you know product drops and that's what we're planning on doing um this isn't going to be like a widely available product for us unless it goes absolutely amazing which i think it will so we'll eventually start working work up to it yeah but um it's definitely some limited drop so please stay tuned for that in the near future so you guys are in colorado you're in michigan soon your solvent list will be in michigan in colorado at

i have to say i'm a big fan of the pineapple chunk it's not super fruity but it's a little sweet it's a little savory it has this quality to it that's a little hard to put my finger on but it's a strain that just has these hash overtones mixed with that pineapple that fruit and that's a stray that's a type that i really like uh just that hashy flavor on the exhale it's a good smoke it's a smooth smooth rip the pax is sweet i hadn't seen that pen before all in all great product and they're 50 in colorado so i believe perhaps the least expensive true 100 solvent-less vape on the market right now as of this filming in colorado so check them out if you're in colorado pyramid go on their website check the links in our description make sure to pick up some of their products i'm a big fan pineapple chunk great strain thank you all for joining us appreciate you tuning in make sure to subscribe to get all of our new videos solventless education and more see you later guys [Music] you", "hMYxdRmZ5l0": "hey guys it's Florida MJ 4:20 here and today I'm going to be pressing some vanilla berry pie 20 point 18 percent THC from three boys farm which is now known as one plant but it was a three boys farm at the time on my 10 tongue that press drip tech dab press nah it's a dead press and it's called dead press so there you go all right so this vanilla berry Piatt is the first order I ever made from one plant and it was a really dry batch with not much smell to it and so I threw in some intent and type of booze pack and all these things to moisten it up it's like 60 - I think it's 52 percent humidity I'm not exactly sure here you can take a look at it inside here I'll give it a small it's got its got a berry smell to it now you're back then I really didn't have much of a smell to it and these do have a good effects these nugs but I think bringing it back to life with the integra was a necessity for sure here's a a nice shot of these nodes before I give them the press like I said they had decent effects even though the flowers themselves were unimpressive alright let's go ahead and get these buds weighed in and that way we can have an idea of what the yield is like go ahead and tear out the scale nodes these are actually pretty decent looking lugs and they they smell again now that I put the booth back in there all right looks like it's 3.5 grams on the money I don't know if you can see that alright and I use the trottle tech method I'm not sure if anybody out there is familiar with it but basically I use a 120 micron mesh bag but cut off at both ends and I'll show you how that works probably need to get something to break this stuff up on I just like to break it up a little bit so that smushes nice and tight into the filter bag if there's any big stems like this I'm just pulling out so I had pressed um some from this batch before and it didn't pretty had really really um disappointing results I don't know if it had been fully rehydrated at that point or not though so who knows alright so now we have an eight broken up right here on this piece of paper is a little bit I'm gonna take the filter bag and just start stuffing it full of weed basically there's definitely a lot more aroma now that I've broken this all up I found another stem in there I'm going to take that outside and break the bag or break through the parchment either you just gotta stuff all this stuff in there basically a couple more little stems in there if this suckers out luckily I don't think I see any seeds go grab something real quick but my help in this there's no escaping the drawer of doom alright so I just basically got a flat it's just a kitchen tool with a flat dough on the bottom handle swing smooch this down basically want to get this as compressed as possible so you can fit all of it in here and have a little puck going on inside the bag that's what I'm trying to get accomplished and so I believe the expected yield I heard something like it you know a good yield should be something like 2% under the stated THC percentage and I've gotten that that seems to be a pretty good rule of thumb I have to say but we'll see what this one does every strain is different every batch is different it depends on the growing conditions on all kinds of stuff the maturity level when they were harvested lots of variables that go into getting a good squish as they say and um so just so you know I'm not I don't want this to be all broken up like this into shake that just happened when I was breaking it up so you know ideally you just want to break it up a little bit so it fits into a puck shape inside here all right now I have my finished shuttle tech puck to be squished and turn into rosin smells pretty good good look at it yeah it's all smushed into a puck and I actually could have had a little bit less of this filter bag right here but that's okay it's not a huge deal I scrape this very last bit of crumbs on there all right but we have our eight of vanilla berry pie all puffed up in our shuttle tech bag we need to set up the damn press to get ready to be pressing some tabs how about that so I'm gonna adjust the camera and get right over there alright so first I need to turn on the heating plates there we go finally and I like to start out at 180 so I'm gonna take that down I just like to do my first passes at lower temperatures to preserve as many Terps as I can gotta have them terpene you know that's what rosin is all about is the Terps otherwise you just have other forms so we got that going at 180 the gauge on this I draw a camp up here that's what's gonna be operating you can see you once gets to 180 it'll be ready to go ready to press some dad's out press some nose alright so now that I've got the heating plates heating up from the PID with up to 180 degrees I'm gonna go ahead and get the press set up between two sheets of parchment paper for the first month all right ready to go all right I've got it all set up just like I need it these I just use cheap bulk parchment paper because I still have this thing in it it just won't seem to run out so I use I double up because it'll press through the parchment paper which is not a huge deal so yeah you just put the button in here give it a press there you go we're just gonna wait for that heat up and once it's ready will squish somebod all right now that the temperature plates are heated up what I'm gonna need to do is take this puck right here and slide it between the plates just like this and you want it to be just kind of centered like that and towards the front a little bit is what I prefer so that it can kind of direct it to come out that way yeah that's just right give me a second guys so after I get the puck in here I like to just so I haven't really started to put much pressure at all on it right now it's just strictly heating up at this point all right so it's been heating up for over a minute now so I go ahead and just start a timer right when I start applying pressure to this and I'm just going to try it as much as I can just keep applying steady pressure to this and I usually take it up to the 4000 on the PSI scale rear and then I'll be able to swing this camera in right here so that we can help you of the drip close-up so let's go ahead and get that started all right it's starting to start the timer as soon as I start to feel the resistance of the pump all right I can feel it so now I'm gonna start it I'm gonna do one minute for the first squish probably not the most exciting quite yeah I'm actually gonna swing that hammer right now hopefully we'll get a nice view of the squish going on all right well I'm a little bit over a minute and we don't get no squishies out of here I guess I don't have enough in there or it's not gonna yield as much as it would need to make a squish that's been in there long enough though so I'm gonna go ahead pull it and to do that undo this toppling like over here what's probably going on here is it just didn't have enough didn't have enough trichomes and stuff to push it out at that temperature all right nice and aromatic that is there's the first squish you say I'm going through the paper there a little bit that's all right we get it put that in the freezer all right so I put the first squish in the freezer and then we'll go ahead and get the second stick ready this is the same thing over again [Music] looks like the bag broke a little bit on that one I went a little too fast so you know usually I try to go pretty slow didn't work out that time so now I'm gonna put the temperature up to 210 degrees all right so I've turned up the temperature to 210 degrees on the plates I like to do that first press at 180 to get as many Terps and you know the nicest press that I can and then I go up to 210 after that to get as much as I can out of now I'll even go up to 220 for the last one so once this is all heated up then I'll be ready to do the second press I've got the plates up to 210 degrees and I've got the puck here so I'm just gonna slide there we go let that heat up just about 30 seconds or a minute or so all right now that it has heated up for about a minute I'm gonna go ahead and start putting some pressure on it this time I'm gonna take it slower so I don't totally destroy it I'm just trying to apply even pressure as much as I can throughout the whole time hid key to sort of get a little tougher up in these thousands give you a nice arm workout well it looks like there's a little bit coming out this time all right a little bit didn't have this already did a about 220 it's starting to drip and I've gone longer than a minute that's for sure I'm missing all of this camera tank sorry this is so bad there we go a bit more pressure just a little bit more now that we got it hurtin and it's just such dark rosin I'm not used to that but same thing happened with the other batch of three boys that I pressed so who knows all right that's plenty of time not too shabby on the second place smells nice it's kind of hippy all right so now we're gonna get the third press down here I'm gonna put this into the freezer let harden up all right so now that the plates are heated up to 220 degrees Fahrenheit I'm ready to go ahead and put the puck in but first I'm gonna have a little shot glass of water right here and I'm gonna just dab a little bit of water on each side of it now just help push out the last of the dabs last of the rosin I should say just that pressure of the vapor a little bit just a little bit of pressure so I can start heating up plates heat up the puck for about a minute or so to bring it up to temperature and that's just to help get the juices flowing basically all right now that the puck has heated up in the press for about a minute I'll go ahead and start applying more pressure slowly as I go at 220 degrees Fahrenheit and hopefully we'll see a little bit come out again it's always nice when you get to see the drip don't see any coming out yet tighten up a little bit still nothing look we should definitely be getting more rosin out that's for sure oh here comes something right there very nice very nice third press and since this is the last press I'll just let this go throw away for a minute and a half two minutes you can pretty good this is on the prison prettiest rosin I've seen that's for sure mm-hmm but I'm sure see what the yield is like press that's a pretty decent press right there for the third press but you can see it is there's a lot less of it Wow very nice berry flavor to this last press interesting what if the water help right now all right so I'll put this in the freezer like the other ones and then it will be back with all of them once they're all frozen and we'll gather them up and I'll tell you what the yield was all right so here I've got the first press and I collect it now as you can see I went through the paper but that's not a huge deal you still get this all up alright so I've got the first press collected and there it is as you can see there's you know there's some stuff on here there's no all my fingers but that's the vast majority of it right there I'm just going to throw it onto a piece of parchment paper for right now and then we'll weigh them all up together at the end get as much of this off as I can but it won't be exact that's for sure mark this is number one I set it over here all right now on to collect the second press here we had the second press and I hope it'll be easier than the first to collect nope it's shattering - let's see how it does that's not so bad all right and here's the second press put this on a piece of parchment also this has got like a taffy consistency to it label that number two and we'll collect the third and final press and then we'll weigh it all up and see what our yield was - stuff like this of course don't touch your rug further than final price right here so I'm going to collect it and you'll know just exactly how much we got is the third press right there number one go ahead and tear out the scale with a piece of the parchment on it sure it's not touching here we go got that tear it out now I'll transfer attached to this parchment and that is point one seven five grams from the first press and it has a really interesting consistency to it it's waxy it's like it's barely even sticky I mean it is but it's nothing like the other pretty cool so I'll mark this you tell the batch number then I'm gonna put it back in the freezer I'll grab the second one all right there's the second batch go ahead and tear out the scale again just like before transfer it over easier to do when it's frozen make sure it's not touching yep not touching 0.18 one second do it a little bit better than the first one which is not surprising because the second one had 210 degrees well unit 108 so there's not as much energy to push out all that rosin all right and they go ahead and tear out the last one transfer one more time whoops I have to wait a trick on this one here we go make sure it's not touching all right it's point zero seven eight there's a tiny bit more on here let me get that so I put this there was a little bit left on there I don't see what's a point seven eight so didn't really add a point seven eight point seven nine point eight let me close this really point seven nine twenty seven eight I'll just call it point seven eight 0.078 all right so label this one this one is a lot stickier look at that it's a lot stickier and that's the last one it has the water so now we'll add these all up and see what our yield was 175 that's point one a one plus point zero seven eight equals point four three four 12.4% yield man that is not good you at all it's just terrible and this is the same thing that happened last time that I pressed this stuff you know I mean I realize look you got a little bit right here but man this is some bad yield right here for 20% so I don't know what the deal is with these I definitely get a lot more out of Tru leave and let's see well if I Curie if gave me some good stuff to so let me mark this off for number three and then we'll take a look at the different batches together here's that one as you can see I mean it doesn't even want to stick to the paper you see that it's hard it barely wants to stick to the paper if you touch it it will stick to your finger because of the heat but other than that it really doesn't want to stick let's batch one at 180 degrees that's too similar but it is a little bit stickier and it seems to be a little unruly or two you see how it's like flakes off like that yeah I don't really like touching batch two very much I'm gonna get rid of it well we just ahead of my fingers and then batch three as we put the water in it much more of an oily consistency and just like before this is all really dark stuff compared to what I'm used to I will press some buds from a you know different dispensary soon and we'll see well you'll see the difference I don't I don't get it I don't understand what the deal is but I mean I would think that the first one would be a nicer color than that but the thing is this stuff is really potent and the smell is nice it concentrates all that smell down from the bud alright guys I just wanted to show you how I press rosin at home and next time I'll make sure and use a screen that gives us a little bit better stuff you know I just had this kicking around for a while now and I figured I might as well get something out of it what I'll do is I think I'll do one more press on this at some other point and I'll tell you if I get anything else out of it alright thanks for watching you guys have a good one", "PX3c1o3bvW8": "yo yo yo what's good you guys welcome to a live stream we're gonna go ahead and do uh the rest of the presses from yesterday that i didn't finish it up got uh six bucks here we're gonna go ahead and start pressing these um i'm thinking at 200. yesterday we did a range of temperatures the lower temperatures were not cutting it so we're going to go back to our our higher tip that i like to do that 202 we're gonna go ahead and uh we'll see how that does got some more parchment so i got the uh pucks properly wrapped up now and prepped in the appropriate size parchment sleeves so we should be able to get a decent flow and we'll just have to see what we get and we'll adjust the temperature as needed i don't imagine we'll be going down below 190 so excuse me one minute while i go ahead and finish straightening some [ __

got this lighter area and we're going to go ahead and we're going to mix all of it together today trim run gelato cake and white runs it's a little darker but oh my god i am in love with the taste already the taste on it is like a mint chocolate chip coffee it's bananas not the flavor but just it's crazy i haven't done any like stirring whipping i haven't done anything to it since last night

led fromage that's uh yeah that's about as good as we're gonna get on that one [Music] [Music] i gotta now i gotta google this [ __ ] i don't know what you're saying but i gotta find out i gotta find out he said okay goodbye [Music] [Music] the power what pleasure strength i'm sorry is that being is that being culturally insensitive am i being stereotypical am i stereotyping i'm sorry let's get this press started i'm banked already [Music] um [Music] excuse me excuse me hold on the tripod get you guys set up and then um we'll go from there [Music] hey [Music] dabbing gloves big force the team oh the team sounds like he's trying to say like uh the team is strong like big up to the team [Music] am i am i right we just started working at amazon working overnights that means you're packing [ __ ] women's dildo orders and [ __ ] huh doing all the freaky [ __ ] overnight i got you on that [ __ ] [ __ ] it's okay boy what else could they use the overnight [ __ ] for at amazon that's gotta be it that's gotta be so [Music] [Music] [Music] my man said he's part of the ginyu force that's what he said until we figure out what he's saying we're just gonna assume that he's saying he's part of the ginyu force [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] foreign oh this one gets loud oh so good return puck feels uh pretty well emptied and got off the plates pretty quick and was the same color or lighter than yesterday a slightly better return feels like so i dropped the temperature a little bit but not much because this stuff does just come out darker because in the terps [Music] so i still want to keep the flow high [Music] myself [Music] uh wow i'm allowed to give you guys information soon but i can't give you information on pricing yet i was told i have to wait until science led makes the official announcement and gets them on their site and then by then they'll have like um shipping times and you'll be able to pre-order and [ __ ] they don't want to put out the information too soon so they told me to wait trust me i'm i'm so ready to tell you guys [Music] you know [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm at uh 190 right now it's just looking off because the lighting is [ __ ] and this is a trim run bro here maybe this will help you guys with the color issue i know it's hard to tell but you'll see you'll see get this in the jar and then we're going to go ahead and start the next puck that was a good temperature and we're gonna run it at that time yeah i don't really have a good spot you guys where you're not gonna be in the [ __ ] way i'll try and move you over a little bit i think my laptop could be [ __ ] maybe let me see food grade month okay you guys if you say so you know what determines whether it's food grade or not how clean it melts when i show you how clean it melts you're gonna be like oh okay yeah that's not food grade the trichomes that come off of trim is usually going to be more mature because it's exposed to more direct light than the rest of the trichomes that are covered in the plant matter right so when you process trim it's going to come out slightly more amber too all right and then if you're dealing with a strain that's really really terpy and depending on what those terpenes are can also make it darker right so never judge judge it by the color alone and be quick to say oh that's food grade or that's not good like it's really really hard to judge it based off of color alone especially fresh off the press so oh yeah definitely people judge with their eyes first for sure you eat with your eyes first you judge off of appearance first but again this is fresh off the plates and you got to give me a couple days and work my magic on it telling you guys i'm telling you huh i want to mention just my lighting is [ __ ] probably back you guys the [ __ ] up huh um the plan is going to be to whip this all up and heat mat it and then burp it at um at a certain point [Music] so good extraction on that one too this is going to turn out just like the los altos did it's gonna turn into that like jam with chunks in it and i'm gonna love it we'll love every minute of it there's not good light over here where's the best light for me let's go in here oh no [ __ ] that room goes crazy let's try right here man the light [ __ ] right now there we go how's that color looking it looks like [ __ ] when you look at it from the top because the camera can't perceive the light the same way but it's just terpius [ __ ] so and you would think oh the lower temperature you go the lighter it'll be no because it just takes too long to get off the plates and we already tried 200 that was too hot then 190 is is the sweet spot it's the best it's gonna get for uh for this i mean i can go like 155 160 and press like five grams at a time maybe get a different result but i'm not pressing five [ __ ] grams at a time that's not what's gonna happen today i wonder if it would help so this is gonna get real silly if i don't put you guys down soon oh this is between 16 to 22 grams in every one of these bags how did you already know right my man saw the board behind me and added it up already my press is feminine thank you her name is bertha so yes she is feminine it's not the craziest smell actually because i'm not running it too hot but it's like a minty coffee lag oh there's some fat ass chunks in this hmm two more oh my goodness we always gotta get one or two huh you know actually i think that you've been on this channel being done before you are the weakest link bye [Music] [Music] i don't know yet my yield on this run yet because we're in the middle of doing it right now i'm not trying to be a smart ass but open your eyes [Music] how old is the material it was a couple weeks old when it was given to me about two weeks old i want to say sat in the freezer for a couple weeks i don't know if uh what the yield has been i haven't really been weighing anything yet so i'll just wait and see i'll wait and find out at the end and i get a veggie burger with uh grilled onions no tomato with fries with uh spread i mean i put my own beyond meat burger patty on it when i get home still enjoy in and out but do it the vegan way yeah buddy but also whoever did mention edibles for food grade i am going to turn a good portion of my cut into edibles or at least caps really potent caps rosin gaps no i didn't do anything today i'm working working working working working and uh somebody else says one more and then collection and then we're going to stir it all up and get it going on the heat map i'm gonna heat mat it at least overnight i'll show you guys i have no secrets no secrets whatsoever i don't time anything i don't look at the gauge anything if i don't know who you are on the gram or if you don't follow or like somebody i know doesn't follow you then i don't accept you you got to tell me what your name is so that i can go and accept you and maybe

lighting in there our windows uh vented sunlight and we'll be able to have some real good sessions okay so so yo i watched this uh hugh hefner docu-series with my wife and it was actually pretty interesting i didn't know that he was so involved in social issues it was really interesting to see that and how he went against the grain with racism and segregation and he would invite um all these black stars to come onto his show right and he had aretha franklin and um brain farting on the other person and but he had like a bunch of different up and coming artists and he wasn't afraid to have them come and perform at his club because he didn't care he didn't see color he just saw talent and he wanted to make it known what his company stood for and didn't stand for and so he interviewed like he did really really in-depth interviews with a lot of celebrities and at one point he did an in-depth interview with malcolm x and malcolm x was you know saying his typical stuff very radical extremist stuff and mind you majority of the readers of playboy back at this time are white and he published it against the advice of all the other people that were working for and he published it unedited and well not unedited like they edited it but they didn't like edit his answers or change his wording they left it all exactly how he said it you know um and i'm like yo that that's [ __ ] ballsy and he got a lot of support for it actually afterwards and a lot of readers wrote in and said that was awesome thanks for sharing that interview blah blah blah so yeah man that was that was really interesting to watch that and obviously to watch his back and forth with struggling to be um you know married and father and all these different things that he just couldn't [ __ ] do living in the [ __ ] mansion i think any normal man would succumb to that [ __ ] after a while especially after being away from your wife the man was surrounded by titties and ass 24 7. like i think he had so much titties and ass i would get tired of it i would be like [ __ ] put some clothes on like it's not even exciting anymore to see your titties they're just always out like put some clothes on surprise me i want to come around the corner and just be like ah titties surprise it's been three days then i'm gonna be like oh titties but if i see titties every time i walk around the [ __ ] house i'm titties like what like it's like looking at an elbow it's just not gonna matter anymore you know just doesn't [ __ ] matter anymore i don't know how that man stayed excited by i guess maybe there was just so many different kinds of titties i don't know i think i would get over it titty climbing wall bro you know how much i just pictured that [ __ ] on my head like a rock climbing wall but instead of rocks his titties yo oh my god you are creative you are creative that is funny he says my friend has a thing for elbows i mean i'm a classic i'm a classy man i i like exposed shoulders if

is cue Pinson is Wednesday in Colorado Springs and Wednesday is important because it is one of the days we like to Rio now before I get started I want to say follow me on twitch TV slash coupons for more awesome live content now Wednesday it's one of the days of the week we get deals on concentrate Wednesday and Saturday are two of the bigger days wax Wednesday and Saturday as they call them not everybody has those deals but a lot of places to do so we always like to look on Wednesday and I always start in the comfort of my own home on weed naps calm want the best places to look they have plenty of deals they can look up everything in my area there's bounce deals there's grand bills there's plenty options there so we're gonna get a little bit of an idea of what's out there before we get started and hopefully we get some really bang stuff today we are in the car here headed to the ATM most dispensaries are cash businesses and it's a lot easier to tip and purchase things with cash oftentimes so we're headed to the ATM to pick up some cash and I'm looking here on my phone actually and signed up at a few dispensaries for their text message alerts and they'll text me with their daily or weekly deals or if they have kind of flash or fire sales as they call them so we're gonna look through a few more deals here on the phone I already have a few ideas from weed Maps so we're gonna maybe go to a few places today once we decide but right now we're headed to get some cash and the dispensaries we are leaving the bank now we pulled out $80 we found a few good deals from a few dispensaries we're gonna go check out the first one now but we're gonna see what we can get with $80 today now I've had some good luck in the past getting a low price grams but we're gonna see what today hold so if they don't have good stuff we're gonna move on but hopefully we can get a few really bang grams for about 80 bucks here okay we are at our first stop for today one of my favorite dispensaries we are at high hopes cannabis with a cause I just started shopping here recently and I haven't been disappointed they have excellent products they always have great prices and the staff here is really friendly so we're gonna go in here and see if we can get some excellent stuff for today okay we are just leaving high hopes now it seems as though the prices are so good today that they've been cleared out so we were able to pick up a couple of different grams that concentrate as well as a pre-roll joint so we've got a gram of blackberry head band sugar and a gram of Agent Orange live sugar and we got a pre-roll joint of that lemon diesel we're gonna enjoy later so excellent prices but the selection was a little light because they must have just got raided oh man the views are sick the trees are covered in frost there's plenty of plenty of cool things to see in Colorado Springs we are outside of our second dispensary shop for today as you can see the views here are insane worse not that Apothecary farms powered by apothecary extracts one of my favorite dispensaries you can get apothecary extracts all over Colorado but they have a few of their own dispensary locations where you can pick up directly so here we are at apothecary farms in the springs looking for some more concentrates what of you over here we are just leaving apothecary Farms had to stop for a moment to check out that gorgeous view it was too good to pass up but we picked up a couple more grams from apothecary we got a gram of axilla wax and we also got a gram of their jam band lime batter which I've been hearing a lot of great things about and they were recommending it there too so we definitely picked up a couple of good ones here and I'm excited to try these right so we've spent all the money we've pulled out for dabs today we got four different grams as well as a pre-roll joint we didn't spend everything we had we've got a little leftover so I'm gonna do a little bit of foresight here a foreshadowing and then we're gonna get some munchies for later I found some coupons in the mail today so we are just going to get our munchies now and we are going to enjoy the dabs later foam pepper on the tomato black olives cucumber and the spinach oh I see this business and what also I'll just go with a little bit of that yeah we'll go at the now thank you good eat just like these chips later bad there's one thing you never expect to see him it's a trenchcoat you never expected so I realized my car is super dirty so we've pulled into a car wash here it's getting clean now my card is getting a pound and it's gonna be a while so we're gonna get up oh yeah and we are on our way home to enjoy our spoils for today more amazing views Colorado Springs is beautiful okay so we just got back home and went to two different dispensaries today high hopes and apothecary farms we got two grams of concentrate from each and we also got a pre-roll joint from my host so let's see we got a few different concentrates different grams here and a pre-roll joint we're all joint one gram of the lemon bezel good stuff nice price on this usually pick these up we got the gram of blackberry headband sugar blackberry headband sugar this is the one that is not a live and let's take a look oh this one looks very nice blackberry had been sugar wax very good stuff this one is from high hopes let's take a look at the other one this is their Agent Orange live sugar so we got a gram of the Agent Orange live this one's a little bit more expensive looks like that one got a little bit mixed up in the bag there I had it sitting upright but maybe it was upside down and that one smells very good check that out check that out this one is really saucy this one has a very very strong smell to it okay and then we also got two other grams from apothecary right and I know we got to two different two kinds here here's the axilla wax this one is 73% th if I can get a difference I'll never focus focus anyway seventy three point nine percent THC this one looks great excellent concentrate in there and one last one we got was the jam band live better and this one is very popular the employees were raving about of this one is eighty two point nine percent THC this one is a really good really good strands got a very good smell right when I open it it smelled amazing so let's take a look here oh yeah this live better okay so let's invite my girlfriend in here near there to do some Deb here is one more look at our spoils for today we got the BlackBerry headband sugar we got some gaygent orange lime sugar we got that pre-roll joint of lemon diesel from high homes we got that axle wax and we also got some jam band live batter so we've got a couple of emails plugged in here

jam band from apothecary and I've got some Agent Orange live sugar from high hopes that's a really tasty the jam ban that's the last one okay we got our last couple of dabs lined up here I've got some of that axilla wax what do you have the BlackBerry headband sugar let's see how these ones taste oh that one's smooth and sweet like that so everything passed the test we got some great concentrates today and we got a couple of live options we spent a little more on the live better in the live sugar but the taste is very good we spent I think just under $80 for four grams that concentrates in the

welcome back to my channel so today we're going to be talking about the baker's dozen this is the frozen this is the frozen I should say that most of the violin is professional violinist are you know looking to buy it and honestly you guys it's it's impossible nearly impossible to get it especially these days so yeah let me talk you through this I have two kinds of the baker's resin I'll give you possibly all the information I have and yeah let's start it alright so I was able to get this resin after waiting for nearly two or three years on the waiting list I was able to get it to roughly a year ago so I have been using it for yeah for pretty much like a year or so as I can really give you my honest opinion I do have two kinds he makes two kinds Rosen's this is the original which has like a purple kind of a brownish stamp and then the green stamp this is the the French version so this is more Italian I'll say he described it as a original Cremonese recipe and this is more after French which is the V own he call it V own sea trout or something like that so there by the way they are made in England and this is a very bakers is a very small company that it's owned by you know it's a family-owned company and basically they make this resin once a year they described on their website during the hottest months on it assume it's during the summer this is where they can get the best fresh sucks you know from the trees and they basically cook it right away the port or fresh so this is like probably the only one in the world that makes a company that makes resin - fresh from like a fresh liquid SAP so the resins Kames beautifully packaged you know they also included like like a little piece of paper which looks like a very kind of old paper with the information about each rosin and I thought it was really really cute looking obviously they were all sealed nicely so the first resin that comes with this kind of a brownish a little stamp and so take a wax stamp would be you know on the top four bakers so the first one is the original and obviously on those Scrolls you have a little information about the rosin so I'm just gonna quickly read a couple of info because I think it's quite helpful to know so the Baker's original is a hundred percent a handmade based on an authentic Ramona recipe dating back to the time of Paganini so you know he claims this is the original recipe recipe and unlike many products this rosin is made from a fresh liquid SAP so if you're not familiar with the resins like usually resins you know that whoever makes the resin the resin makers they buy a SAP which is comes in the solid and then they kind of melt and you know two older magic and they make the resin so baker's resin is made of the liquid SAP so he's basically doing right away so you know the this obviously is resulting in a superior resin and fresh or product so it's a hundred percent natural and the highest quiet quality you can imagine so the reason this resin you guys is so difficult to to get and so hard to get is basically it's because it's a seasonal product and they can just only make so many of that resin and I believe they put you once you get it they put you on the list and I believe you can buy it every two years they send you email you know here's your fresh frozen would you like to buy it as far as I know you guys I'm gonna leave his website down below anyway but as far as I know the list the website is like closed for a new customer I know it's not gonna be really helpful but you know you can you know look into it for the future and see you know maybe they won't reopen the new customer list and you know hopefully you can get on it but ya expect to wait a couple of years because you know like I said I waited a few years for this rosin so anyway so this is the original rosin and it's beautiful you guys I mean look at this eye you can obviously tell that I use it quite a bit during this past year so this has this original Rosa has like a little like kind of like an ember you know outside color so it's a little bit darker than the young rosin so this is the original the second recipe comes with the same packaging but it has a little bit like a green kind of a wax stamp again with the letter B on top this resin in accordance to his information this is the Baker's young Citroen is created but hint from a traditional French recipe which was popular a wonder Lyon was alive so again it's made of the fresh liquid SAP and yep in this result this resin is highly reactive to players input and capable of a broad range of tonal variations so this rosin is lighter in color as you can see from the original one so this is the French recipe and the other one is what Paganini was Italian so Cremona I guess it's Italian recipe so this is this is basically the only two resins you can get from him this is what he specialized in so before I will tell you what I think about those resins I did record a little sound sample and just I'm gonna insert it now so you can go ahead and listen and just think about it like can you hear the difference alright so you can see both of them and just tell me if you can hear the difference [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] so could you hear a difference because I couldn't if I listen to this recording to me it sounds exactly the same I did use two different bells they were all clean so I had a fresh you know rosin on on each of the bows now I even when I play it you guys I couldn't tell much of the difference between one and the other formula maybe I like the original a little bit better than the French recipe but there is really very little difference and honestly it all is gonna come down to your personal preference okay now let me talk about the price a little bit because knowing that this is so hard to find you would think that this resin is gonna cost a fortune because if you're familiar with the curent resins they're on the market some of them can be extremely extremely expensive and to my surprise a year ago I paid about $25 for each US dollars for each resins that cost me $50 or something like that $50 for two Rosen's I think it's extremely inexpensive considering how much work you know he put into it so the price point of this rosin is just there it's perfect like I mentioned my personal preference if I will have to choose for life just one I probably would go with the original and then this would be my second choice but honestly you guys those two are equally equally very very good resins I would agree with the claims that has a very low low dust you know which is good especially for those who are allergic those people who are allergic you know even when you rosin about you know there's very little rosin dust coming out and also very little rosin dust is accumulating on top of the violin which is good these are super smooth you know very but they can be quite crispy if you need to you know it's it's obviously depend of your technical abilities of your you know obviously your right hand has a lot to do you know with that articulation but I found this roses to be really really good I have no any complaints whatsoever the question is is this resin the best rosin in the world considering the fact how difficult is to get and you know although obviously all the claims I don't know if this is the best or is this as the only one because I own quite a few resins you guys and I compare this resin to my other resins and honestly I think they are all beautiful you know and I'm talking about you know more expensive resins you know let's say the leather bespoke rosin from Australia that cost twice as much probably as this or even more and yeah I feel like that rosin is equally as amazing as this so it's very hard to tell you guys I'm just being completely honest with you so if I'll have to you know just choose one rosin for life I don't have extremely hard time because and I'm by the way I'm gonna do the video if you want me to do it give it a thumbs up on my top top five favorite resins let me know if you wanna hear that video so um yeah I think at the end of the day all of it comes to your personal preference what do you like there even you guys I'm getting so kind of picky because for certain pieces for certain about I'll use it different resins so I'm talking about like I'm going to the next level this is not necessary because I feel like one one of those rosin would be perfect for you know playing any piece yeah is this the only one is this the best yes and no I mean it's your personal preference it's exactly what you like exactly what you believe in exactly what it sounds good to you how much a good sound you can take out of this you know how much the rosin is really helping you with creating a beautiful sound articulation and all of it so I think it's a really personal preference at the end of the day and I would highly recommend to get it if you can if you can be lucky enough to get this yes go for it try it for yourself especially that it's not you know that expensive and you're not gonna be disappointed for sure but at the same time I don't want you to feel that you must have this rosin because this is the only resin that you're gonna be happy and satisfied with so there we go yeah I'm pretty sure you can buy you know different resins and be equally happy and satisfied you know using this so there we go guys so this is exactly what I think about this no complaints whatsoever it's a beautiful resin I will leave mr. Baker's website down below although I read just recently he's not taking any new customer so I'm sorry for that you guys but if you do get a chance to get you know this resin just try it it doesn't hurt it's a great resin and I'm sure you're gonna be very happy alright guys thank you so much for watching if you're new to my channel don't forget to subscribe give it a thumbs up if you like this video and also give me a thumbs up if you want me to do my top four top five you know favorite rosen's so yeah let me know if you have any questions and I'll duck take some bite", "enz-OhEF6lA":

dab one dollar there so we had a one dollar dab as it looks like it looks it looks like it's for you know people who don't smoke as much and you're looking to you're in no how about this oh i think this is for more it's glass huh is this glass i think you just toss the whole thing in there yeah really i think so i'm just joking i don't know you don't burn all that that's [ __ ] plastic honey it's plastic that little rubber thing no not that or is there a read me i wonder if it's fire it's batter so you think you just put it in there you just i don't think you put all this in there no no not that green obviously i don't think i don't even think you put that glass piece into either think about it sure i don't know is there another youtube video no [ __ ] it won't we won't you want to light this for me yeah here i'm gonna put this back on so yeah it's not over i know i know so uh randy's gonna heat that up for me i'm gonna take this hit but yeah it pretty much looks like just one hit that's kind of lame to be honest you know you can't just grab it like that yeah here we go yeah my [ __ ] finger slime so uh i am gonna drop this in here but it is [ __ ] hot as [ __ ] so let's just cool it off a little bit you know if you want me to hold it for the camera for you or just leave it oh yeah yeah hold the hole hopefully it's the lighting i'll find out right now oh yeah i have to put it back yeah all right just this one yeah turn up the iso it's not bad let me see i already should not touch screen right so [ __ ] i'm scared all right ready [Music] it is you just drop it in there but uh we don't have a carb cap guys so we couldn't enjoy it as much but i definitely got a good hit man as you can see right here oh i wish i had a carb cap though but yeah that's really really cool that they did this yeah i feel like we should do that again with the car cab it's better at the end of the day batter can only go so far and when it cramps to like taste and stuff it probably wasn't going to get me too high but the idea of a one dab uh one dollar dab how are we going to get this out this is 12. that's cool dropping it yeah i can see that's becoming a thing i really can probably for people who are like just really interested in dabbing and don't know it's like if you have if you're if you have like a dollar at laying around why not right it's a it's a weird experience but it's cool yeah can you blow it out there hella higher because this is what i'm gonna do oh check this off watch out for the water though hold this here thank you for saying that boom oh crap it wasn't gonna go out today you know what i'm saying we're turning to the ground and i'm saying just like the sand it was before time i was gonna clean this this is mine it's cool so uh burn that uh let's pack you a hit of do i have my stuff on i'm not using this no you haven't tried this yet we're gonna give him this is the sherbert so i have a diamond i think that crack diamond oh did you say that diamonds aren't as tasty yeah man let us know if you guys tried that dollar dab or if you've heard of a dollar dab or anything like that similar or you know let us know in the comment section below yeah seriously though seriously though it looks like a phone experience for the dance for him that's a [ __ ] that's a dollar dad right there it's a [ __ ] fat one dude i want a light but dummy no i'm saying we're gonna take some dabs here and then we're probably gonna end the video here just uh a quick one i just wanted to showcase the dollar dab that was just the main focus of this video and honestly it was uh not bad at the end of the day it was only a dollar you know and if you don't want to tip your butt tender because he or she was an ass or not giving you the good [ __ ] spending on that instead of giving it a dollar to them you know i'm saying i don't know just some stuff to try out but look at all that remaining it was definitely a lot for a dollar with that you can see that's a all the excess stuff burning yeah we don't have a car kit huh huh we don't have a car kit we're [ __ ] what if we use this just kind of like oh yeah you can yeah right yeah i don't know why we didn't think about this [ __ ] wow damn it you have to be high first here give me that i don't know if i should do that yeah okay it's going in it's ready yeah cheers you guys hope you guys are enjoying the videos you watch continue to support my homie and yeah go up here more show them that droppage oh yeah oh yeah rainbow sherbet yeah it's smooth yeah yeah diamonds are not as harsh but yeah yeah good good call on this let me try that for ben frizzles [ __ ] yeah i wish i had thought about that earlier i'm stupid that's cool all right even though we didn't do i didn't do it i did tell you that the taste was there it was good it was good so excited we couldn't cap it for you guys though [ __ ] anyways damn you barely touched this yeah i know can you light it i told you i've been smoking the other one oh yeah [ __ ] that [ __ ] that video you guys would have already seen by now maybe yeah if you guys see the basements that i bought that trash i'm trying to burn all of it all through it you know i'm trying to best for life trying to save the bet yeah the best for last you know best believe i wasn't gonna bring that out to the homie andrew that's [ __ ] disrespect bring that [ __ ] around scent you know what i'm saying so i was like nah i ain't gonna do it anyways so i only brought the [ __ ] the cart and my uh forbidden fruit and we have a good time for you guys man all right oh yeah try this car it's kind of clogged so it's all right uh in the video guys i said it was 100 uh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "0AeKFsbDbo8": "all right so we're going to be squashing there's like three different strains in here this nice keef nice pile of that we'll be squashing this at 170 degrees you want to wind strong said five times [Music] is should be a nice gusher of course you want to go low and slow on this too we'll double bag it awesome get a little bit of extra peg protection we got it all loaded up there double bagged all right as i said 170 on the press there [Music] and now we're gonna lower it down just to let it let the plates hit and of course we'll let it sit there for about about 25 seconds a little longer just to let it let it working cause that bag is kind of full it's been 25 seconds we're gonna add a little bit more pressure to it you don't want to over press this you don't want to press it real fast and heavy because you will have blowouts a lot of times if you do that so you want to nice and slow just you know feel it as you uh apply pressure if it's easy once it starts get a lot more rough pressure to it let it sit there and let that heat loosen it up a little more so it's kind of low and slow all right so we're starting to get it coming out on this this side right here so it should be coming out here a little bit more pressure all right so now we have it coming out right here down both right there and there all over there strictly i grade [Music] all the time all right we're gonna go ahead and pull this one because you know what if there's still rosin left in there we can still squash that bag again new strain news flash got the best grass got to take two and pass by no means average good god i got to have it babies are perfect and like the way you dream less smoke with friends uncle stone i like the way you dream it's yo dabbity we're gonna dab it dab it up we like the way you trim it this is a nice shield nice squash here yo dabbity we gonna dab it and of course you see there's still some stuff left in that bag so we will definitely squash that one more time all right this is uncle stone many blessings peace out my two favorite parts after squashing and making some beautiful rosin first one is gathering it so so [Applause] so as i said this was a nice yield of three different kinds of teeth no this i know there's definitely vanilla cush is one of the strains that was in this all right it's getting close to my second favorite part of this process that's nice all right now the fun part the sampling of it we like the way you trim it yo dabbity [Music] uncle love the way you dab so freak what they heard monster kong marketing", "9DJ3hRZBgTQ": "yo yo yo what's good you guys welcome back to another live stream it is time to do it do what dab [ __ ] so get your dab rigs out get your rosin ready if you're not smoking rosin i don't know what you're smoking but uh as long as it's not bh no that's okay let's take some dabs we get some music going here i downloaded the [ __ ] tj [ __ ] but i guess i did it oh oh what's that yes here it is let's select all and play blackout 2 a m [Music] [Music] i am the light controlled by the sun i know [Music] [Music] me [Music] wow [Music] [Music] blackout [Music] is [Music] fire fire [Music] that dab just keeps rolling on me right now [Music] [Music] woo ah that was good [Music] yeah man i got bored with my hair and i was like yo why do something with this [ __ ] no i was [ __ ] i just got a shower and i was like brushing it i put in some stain conditioner and [ __ ] and my [ __ ] my wife was like she said it like three times she was like if you want me to do that just let me know and i'm like you just want to play with my hair huh and she's like no no no i just you know i don't want you to be in pain you know brushing through it if you want me to do it i can do it for you i like babe just come here just come do it i know you want him so she came over and i uh i sat down in her chair at her vanity and let her brush through it and [ __ ] comb it out and put in a little bun showering and streaming totally different uh all right let's get uh let's get this [ __ ] going um let's check on the amount of ice that we've got in the reservoir we'll see if we need to top it off i'm pretty sure we're going to go ahead and top it off with some more ice probably two more 20 gallon reservoirs full of ice which is i don't know i haven't waited i'm guessing when i fill up that trash can it's approximately 60 to 80 pounds of ice based on like when i have 20 pound bags of ice i'm just guessing you know probably about 60 to 80 pounds so i'm gonna add another 150 or so pounds of ice and then yeah we'll go ahead and get the bud and the bags and finish prepping the rest of that [ __ ] san bueno [Music] what's up cv [Music] [Music] ready to wake yeah [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] i fill this thing up almost all the way right and i do this i put about four to five of these in there just when i start the water then it gets to where you see it right now where a lot of the ice is melted the water is really cold but it's not full and i add a couple more and we're cranking the ac at 62. ugh [Music] [Music] [Music] looking at the movies [Music] [Music] we pray to god [Applause] got that all the way open we got the booster pump on i think yeah the booster pump is plugged in out there [Music] we don't have any other pumps or anything on so that should fill up the rest of the way pretty quick and be nice and frosty [Music] [Applause] do i have enough to start a wash sure i'm sure [Music] now you're gonna have to excuse my mess i've been trimming in here so i don't want to hear no [ __ ] but you know me i'm transferring i show it make sure this valve is closed back here we're gonna go ahead and fire up the freeze dryer and pull the trays we're gonna clean the trays and then um [Music] me [Music] alcohol [Music] and then i'm gonna go ahead and [Music] hit my seal with a little bit of iso sometimes when you collect the uh the higher micron stuff that's fluffier and you go up the uh the freeze dryer you'll get a little bit of um almost like backdraft sort of it's basically just a lighter fluffier ash and it wants to go towards the uh the vacuum the vacuum cloth and so it'll cause a little bit of the hash to stir up and so every once in a while if that happens you gotta wipe out the hatch from wherever it flies onto most of the time it just goes to the seal so you just wipe it off the inner part of the seal a little bit of alcohol every once in a while you'll get some that builds up in the shelves you can take the whole seal off the door wipe it down you can pull the shelving unit out of the whole pretty much freeze dryer chamber if you want and you can vacuum it out you can wipe it out [Music] i'll be doing a uh a little bit of a maintenance video on the freeze dryer um here in about a month [Music] during that time i'll show you guys how to disassemble the freeze dryer and inspect it in certain areas for certain things and then how to clean it and put it back together [Music] so i'm just hitting my seal that the door forms a really good seal and you make sure that you get into one vacuum [Music] and there we go [Music] take my cover off we'll put the cover back on a little bit [Music] come on [ __ ] get on there right thank you okay [Music] lagging huh [Music] close out some of this [ __ ] i got open on my phone holy moly i had a lot of [ __ ] open [Music] better all right so now i'm gonna just flip the freeze dryer on it turns on and it says updating log files and blah blah during that time if you have a thumb stick in the um side of the freeze dryer or whatever it will go ahead and update the log files that you have on the thumbstick [Music] sit sit we're going to have that [ __ ] unplugged i'm going to put it back in real quick [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] i just noticed there is no slaps unacceptable i'm tired of seeing everybody else's slapped up [ __ ] freeze dryers sorry my man puffin i love you bro but i'm not putting your sticker on my freeze dryer it's too [ __ ] big send me another small one and i'll put it on there but i am not sticking that big ass [ __ ] penguin on my freeze dryer i've got to have the biggest slaps on there buddy went into my little stash box here got some slapperonis so we're gonna throw those on there i got these big-ass puffin ones too big sorry buddy boy i thought i had a smaller puffin sticker somewhere i guess not first and foremost the first one that has to go on has to be this one now where do we put this one [Music] hmm right there you feeling that [Music] my yield just went up five percent [Music] hmm and this one up here down here do we want them close to each other yeah we do yeah we do [Music] my yield just went up another two and a half percent and my freeze dryer got about 10 extra [Music] horsepower [Music] and my terps just went up 50 percent yield yield terps slap some [ __ ] slaps on your freeze dryer step your yields up step your terps up no cap [Music] let go i know i have another puffin sticker somewhere around here that was it i think it's in the house i think my daughter has it i gave my daughters some puffin slaps yo what's up with this [ __ ] connection right now hold on a minute it's like everybody at my house on the [ __ ] wi-fi right now there's whistler tech i might have a whistlertech going in the new hashtag not right away not right away it's gonna take probably probably about a month or two because the hashtag itself is costing me quite a bit and the whistlertech units run about 10 grams yeah see that's the thing the battery cover is on it's weird i don't know why it's doing that mr [Music] all right freeze dryer's cooling off we've got to wash some um i don't like how high you guys come on come over here let's go back over here it's cause you guys need to be grounded apparently you guys don't lag when i'm holding you it's weird exotic pointed that out and it seems to be true but um so yeah dab time and then um we're going to clean some trays um we don't run parchment so yeah let's get those uh those dap tools [Music] ready about to be in trim jail for the next couple days i i've been checking it every day it's not ready i think tomorrow is gonna be the day i'm gonna go in there and start taking it all off and doing that final trim it's gonna something [Music] yeah it was stuck in there i just saw that right now and pulled it out alexis [Music] goodbye [Music] [ __ ] the cleanest goddammit mystic talented son of a [ __ ] start your terp caves [Music] on your marks get

[Music] is i if it dies we're coming back", "UfFOHfZCKkE": "what up this is chip from the real dirt podcast man today we get to talk about one of my favorite subjects of all time that is solventless extracts that's right water-based extracts today i'm talking with my good buddy chris from solely solventless out of denver and man he's been really like pushing the bounds of uh um extraction water extraction rosin extraction in the colorado area so if you're around if you're around denver or come to denver definitely uh check it all out man hey guys and if you haven't joined already please join us at therealdirtpodcast.com subscribe on itunes and hey man check out our new youtube channel you know we're just working on it but uh should be all of our episodes loaded up there real soon and uh i believe that is the real dirt podcast on youtube so thanks again for joining us today and as always sit back and fire the largest joint you can and enjoy this episode of the real dirt and this is chip from the real dirt good morning hello one and all another episode of the real dirt podcast this is 2021 and today we're gonna talk about extracts concentrates how they're kind of made and what they are the first time i ever heard of a concentrate of course it was it was called hash and we didn't quite know what it was and this guy kevin price i believe he was he he was like hey i got some hash she you know and we looked at it and we were like man this looks like rabbit [ __ ] are you sure this is hash and to this day i'm pretty sure he sold me rabbit [ __ ] as hash and we didn't know any better so we smoked it but it's come a long ways and as soon as i got real extract which was jamaican hash oil back in way long time ago i realized the potential of extracting the trichome and extracting the molecule from cannabis and have really been fascinated with it since then in all its forms from traditional hand rolled hash to sheaved and pressed hash to bubble hash to sub critical co2 butane propane solventless like i'm really fascinated and interested in it all and today we have chris from solely solvent list chris a good friend of mine say hey chris how you guys doing out there thanks for having me chip you know chris is an unsung hero he has some of the finest extracts on the market they're boutique and rare to find and if you ever see them absolutely scoop them up they may be a little bit more expensive than the ones sitting next to it but you know what it is absolutely worth it hitting it chris i appreciate all those nice words there chip yeah man just paying attention to detail man and you know really having a love and appreciation for this plant and all that's all its power that it entails you know so you know we're small small batch but uh you know we're just starting out if you do happen to catch us on the show like chip is saying yeah man you definitely gotta give us a shot you won't be disappointed we like to take our time like i said that attention to detail is important when it comes to solving this extracts there's a few things you definitely have to uh pay attention to as far as the input or the material you're using to get that output that we all desire are what you know the customers are desiring these days one of the biggest things about xtract is the quality material in gets exceptional quality out and many people just use the trash you know to make it and and you can't absolutely do that but to me you guys can best gear possible you use the best buds possible that's right my friend yeah a lot of credit goes to the action you know the cultivators first the flower has to be top-notch the flower's banging and it's on point and usually you know the hash on the other end comes out what you would like as far as like you know quality numbers you know that can all vary from a few different things different genetics and yield different numbers in those areas you know it's it's all interesting it's all you know experimental it's just great to learn and you know every day you know whether it's something that really throws down a lot of hash you know and you know it's in the family of the gmos or the cakes or something like that or something that doesn't really throw down as much it's more you know on the terp side i mean that's all important you know it depends on what you're looking for what are you starting off the day with man you you you smoke weed in the minute at the beginning of the day are you one of those people i mean probably like three or four times at the beginning of the day three or four times at the beginning uh i mean what did i have this morning i had a little bit of the uh some some live rosin made by myself it was some uh i call it the gumbo mix or you know my term that's right because chris is from actually from louisiana yeah you're right you're right um he's also our resident go-to of anything southern cooking food as well he holds the gumbo and shrimp and grits title at cultivate colorado currently right nobody compared yeah i mean i i i take that pretty probably anybody wants to step up at all i'll take it you know but oh man when we made shrimp and when you made shrimp and grits down here in oak okc my crew here never had it and literally the other day they were like man that time you guys made shrimp and grits he actually said chip you made tripping crap right uh i didn't take credit i mean it was a team effort man come on we watched you do it extracting hash is just like cooking you can be a cook or you can be a chef right you got all the right ingredients you got all your temperatures together you prepare everything properly you prep everything properly then wow you got something then right yeah 100 yeah like uh you know a lot of people you know may not go along with the the mix material washes but i particularly like those because as you were saying with i like cooking and flavor profiles and things like that you know you take two different you know hatches and mix those together you never know what you're gonna get man like you can be in a mood this day take a hit of that you know the same hash you know that you hit two days ago and get different flavor profiles because you might be in a different mood or something you know it just really depends like today a mix of tropicana banana and monkey berries and i really like that that's my gumbo mix for this morning chocolate chip did pretty well those did about i think that was at four percent together so not bad numbers so you're mixing these you're mixing these flavors in the bag yes i like to actually mix material together and wash it together in the bag you can do it separate if you like and then mix the resin at the end and press it like that if you want you know that's a preference thing man everybody got their own way to do it yeah way i like to do it you know so it works out well for me i don't have any issues with it taste fire love the taste so we've been babbling a little bit here i realized like there's a lot of people that listen to these podcasts or we'll see this podcast that don't really understand what hash or extract or rosin or resin or solvent list or bubble or co2 or any of this stuff is man let's just let me get your opinion of it let's let's let's start at the beginning let's have like a 101 basic extract course from chris i would tell you this i honestly um you know definitely knowledgeable in the extracts but as far as an extract connoisseur or someone who is going to go to a store and buy an extract over flour that was not me three or four years ago i would say the hydrocarbon extractions or co2 whatever you want to call it those extractions you know just we're not really that interested in them as far as like dabbing them but definitely using them for edibles and things like that which they would come up really well in edibles so you know never really you know downplayed it or anything like that but starting just like let's let me let me pause you right there and ask you and let's make some ex explain to people what's going on so most of the extract you see on the shelf at a dispensary say in colorado or california it's some mostly some sort of wax or goo or oil or shatter and most of that is made with butane or protein propane some type of hydrocarbon mixture right right right right they're literally just combining all of the the plant material they're mixing it with the hydrocarbon and then they're separating out the plant material the hydrocarbon they're recollecting the solvent the hydrocarbon yep and what's left is the extract right right right right and that's what mostly is on the shelf so when you're when you have a pen what's what's in most pens chris you get a mix of a few things these days i've seen uh you know you get your distillate pins mixed with terps i would say uh you get your sauce pins i've seen you know lately you're starting to see some live rosin pins kind of new on the market but mostly mostly just through it and terps i would say which you know distillate would be you know just your pure thc no flavor profile and then able being able to take different tariff profiles and then add that to the distillate you know um it was some sort of solvent these those are all mostly solvent yes correct yes right right but but you mentioned rosin tell me what the difference is between solvent lists and and the the non-solvents oh well you know as you mentioned uh earlier with the uh actual process of collecting the trichomes using hydrocarbon uh with a non-solvent uh extraction or a solvent extraction as you want to call it you're actually going to be using water as the solvent or as the carrier or the lubricant whatever you want to call it but like super cold water so you want to use a combination of ice and water to actually collect those trichomes opposed to the hydrocarbon so a healthier way or a healthier method i would say as far as like uh approaching the extraction process but uh you know each process equally has benefits for whatever end product or whatever way you want to do with it but i just if you're asking me water and ice seems pretty safe and clean to me so using that path to actually strike trichomes uh you know solving this just you know really stuck with me when that started coming around i think nicotine probably is the guy to give respect to that starting that term from what i understand you know and he's been around for a minute pushing out some great product just learning and discovering that really got me really interested in that and these days you're starting to see it they're starting to be rising carter just popping up you know rising and batter live jam you know uh sauce and diamonds even like people starting to even make diamonds and solvents which is crazy because that's like mechanical separation and things like that it costs more for a reason though you have to put more raw material you have to take more care in the solventless extract than just a hydrocarbon extract the material 100 matters you can do it from trim and things like that well taken care of trim will deal some great results but decide it'll actually use you know your prized buds you know and something that a cultivator or you know cultivar that does really well you know you're gonna you gotta wash it you gotta collect it run it through the bags you know then take it from the bags goes to the freeze dryer you know that's in there for 24 hours comes out of the freeze dryer then you have to see that then you have to you know collect it again into your screen bags and then now you have to press it so you know you press it then you collect it and then now it has to cure whether you want to you know heat cure it cold care room temp cure whatever it may be there's all these different ways you can approach it there's no wrong or right way in my opinion it's all great technique yeah it's all technique and preference you know some people swear by full spectrum you know or like some people swear that oh it's got to be the 9120 or only 90 you know and that's like man that's cool you know that's great that's your preference you can like that but like you know it's it's it's all out there man it's everybody likes something a little bit different and it's great that you have the options with verizon you can do that also when you you use different material you get different results and it's really hard on the commercial market to have the same exact material over and over and over and over again and and so that's the importance of like what we're talking about you got to watch it see what's going on because what might collect what even one strain grown by one guy might collect differently than the same strain grown by someone else right and you you've you've seen this over and over again like wow man those crystals are really small those crystals are really fat like this is nothing but glands this is nothing but stocks you know yeah man i've seen two two different growers two same exact stream like almost one and a half percent difference you know which is crazy you know like that's a decent amount of difference you know but still great outcomes on that on that particular stream but uh yeah you're right uh environment that's actually grown in um you know maybe i'm starting to notice has a play in into that too and maybe appearance of the actual riser you know whether it's going to be a little bit lighter things like that whether those whether that person maybe pulled that product a little bit early harvested a little bit early things like that and you know kind of go into it too you kind of never really know so like having a good relationship with your suppliers where you're getting your material from really helps you know and like consistently consistently knowing that you know you're dealing with these guys it's going to be this every time you know you know that it's going to put out you know these guys grow it perfectly and boom you know everyone does good yeah well it takes a different mentality well slightly different mentality to grow for for high quality extracts i mean many people grow for extract but they're just literally trying to grow biomass they're just trying to grow like weight man the highest quality stuff though it comes from when you really take care just like you would ganja right all the way to the end and you finish it the same way and you know you dry it and store it and package it all the same way like you know maybe i mean you don't have to trim it necessarily right but like you definitely have to like you know there's a little bit of processing going on yeah you definitely like to prep it i mean you know you know you don't want to put any you know leaves that doesn't have any any sugar in there you definitely don't want that sure in there you know so you got to prep it a little bit but definitely as far as like taking care of it and growing it with the utmost attention attention to detail you know as far as like i know you don't have to do your ipm's but you have to minimize those things like that you know that really like carries over into your end product you know later in your flower cycle when you come up with an issue you know that's love matters you know so you got to be on it from the beginning man and take care of the growing environment you know many people are familiar with with this term bubble hash or water hash but let's talk about why what this solvent list how it's different from from just like a crude extract with water yeah so with bubble hash you know in the cycle route to get rosin you pretty much get bubble hash first but like you said most people are used to seeing you know the bubble hatch in the form of you know looks like sand i guess almost keith rather people familiar with the grinders you know and you have to keep catchers but like typically you know whenever you're washing the material and collecting it in the bubble bags you know before the whole freeze dryer thing at this point you take it out of the bubble bags you gotta pretty much dry it at the perfect condition to get it to not mold or anything to be able to go from like you know you know the bubble hash process like that that we're all use that's a pretty intricate process too to get that right to get that correct for freeze dryers like i mean i guarantee you i would have failed plenty of times you know what i'm saying i mean i i mean i maybe tried it a few times when i first moved here from louisiana trying to do some bubble hatch before rosin was even a thing you know and you know it came out well but that whole drawing process is tricky and lucky out here it's dry the standardized you know so it was pretty you know relatively easy to learning curve is you know easy out here with that lack of humidity but i don't know if that would happen in louisiana i end up with some moldy hash man you know a few times i'm sure yeah yeah you got to control your dry environment yeah but you know now but now with with free drives it's a different story yes free drive is definitely a different story pull it out of the bag wet press it out water out a little bit put it in the freeze dryer yeah right yeah and even with you know i mean still with freezer i mean you know you're using freeze dryers i mean people don't tell me you could press it in horizon a lot of people keep it as melt too you know you you know you separate use your bags and use that 90 bag get some full melt people really love that nice full melt these days it seems like you know different strains are going to give you different meltability of the heads but like usually that that 90 through 119 seems to be that that one that people love for that good bubble hash melt you know super clean heads you know barely any specs of anything you know but you know it's got to be clean that's got to be taken care of properly to get to that point you know and using the freezer man just freeze-dried bubble like can be incredible oh yeah right a few times i've had it it's been ridiculously good right but it's to get that high quality dabbable bubble at that point like it's really really strain specific that you hardly get any yield you know out of your your your batch when you do it that way right compared to kind of like what you're doing and you're making you're extracting as much quality material out of the the leaf as you can with water you're taking it freeze drying it right and then what happens well from that point once it comes from the freeze dryer we take it and we put it between these nice plates by these low temp plates i like to use those plates but they're great heated plates low temp heat and pressure um the bubble hatch goes into filter bag and then between the two plates and that presses out the rosin so you go from the bubble hash and then those two plates creates almost like a you know like an environment of where pretty much that that protective layer on the resin heads or you know that the bubble hash bursts from the heat and the pressure and it oozes out all that good oil rosin and you collect it into the jar or into your banger or whatever i've seen people do some crazy stuff on instagram but so basically it goes to a jar we're using water yeah and then we're freeze-drying it and then we're using a press with some heat on it that's right right and this is this is all just water and heat right natural man that's it water heat a little bit of pressure you know and boom you got some rosin you have some beautiful extract that you can then take from that state and cure it how you'd like or you can keep it in a fresh press state you know take it into cartridges take it into edibles which oh man make some beautiful edibles tastes so good i love that that you know some people complain about that weed taste or whatever i like a nice rosin taste and an edible in my opinion that tastes good me too yeah i prefer all the edibles with more basic extracts uh keef water rosin oh yeah right i i prefer those as extracts for sure hey all of you uh uh edible companies out there man don't just use distillate make some with keef make some with rosie yeah your clientele will love it too i'm sure they'll start learning you know when to experiment with different inputs is you know the education of all this stuff will definitely keep growing with more states becoming legal here you know as we keep seeing it almost weekly and it seems like i see another state is passing some you know medical cannabis or recreational loss which is great man so you know hawaii yesterday alabama tennessee like people in texas new york new jersey like it's going everywhere right it's happening man it's happening and that's great you know and you know that people people are going to want they're going to want to learn about it you know that's how it is man you know the thing about private market cannabis and that industry is is we always try to squeeze as many dollars as many cents out of a square foot or out of a plant as possible because you know it was gray market or it was totally illegal and and now that we have these legal markets it allows to us to do research and experiment with with cannabis on a different scale and you know even though like solventless you know might be twice as much on the shelf it might be 65 80 a gram on the shelf you know the the the manufacturer still is he's not really like making a ton of money at that price it's literally you know he's making less money that way than he would if he was doing butane or propane or co2 right he's making less money that way than he would if he was actually probably selling the buds for flour too right like it it really gives is solventless extract it really defines to some degree a different segment of cannabis production right because it's not just like this like the biggest bang for the buck right get the most money out of the square foot it's like hey i want to make this product and this is how we make it and then the market bears the price 200 100 yeah it's definitely a it's a it's a special product that like you're saying it's there's multiple steps to it man you know so so complex i mean it should be worth 120 a gram i mean i was just out in california and that's what it was about yeah it's 120 a gram there though because all the taxes that go on yeah and that's and that's what i was yeah it was attacked right right but yeah it's uh i don't like to say it's not for everybody but like you know if you want to get into it man it's definitely something that like it takes a little bit of you know diving into you know there's a few steps to it a few things that you definitely gotta you know you gotta pay attention to detail that's what this is man you know it's more like a food or a laboratory-like environment all right not to say not i mean that's what you know other extraction techniques as well not to say that's not how you would treat it with that one but like you know just particularly with the solvents man like like you said you grow all your flour you could take this flour and sell it as flour or you would take it and you know throw it in this water with this ice swishing around and hopefully some trichomes come out i mean you know that sounds crazy yeah crazy it does you know the research and you know the groundwork that a lot of people have done you know in the past few years i would say have definitely like built that confidence and i would say you know definitely curious minds like me for sure because it was definitely tough for me to dive into it too i remember thinking about this more than a few years back i'm like man that's crazy just take the flower and throw it in there and like like really okay but now you learn and you get educated and you're like okay now it makes sense you know now okay cool i'm definitely gonna go take my flower and throw it in there and do that you know because this browsing thing just tastes really good makes my edibles taste really good too so sorry i just had to break for a second you guys over at the uh i just do yeah right yes yeah i know you gotta have security up in the studio man all kinds of [ __ ] roll up here i mean tupac learned it the most i know dude that's right that's right i just was watching a couple episodes on hip hop evolution about that sad story man sad story sad story sad story yeah you know greatness often is is snuffed out too early man that that's you know i lost a couple friends this year uh danny smallwood and rob cox and man like you know it's always sad when uh flame goes out too quick man yeah that's right yeah man my condolences i'm sorry to hear that man hey both those guys danny and rob loved extract love bubble rob love bubble i was making it with both of those guys in literally 2002 and nice we we got super high you know on more than one occasion on a a handmade bubble that we just made with literally pantyhose and silk screen and man you're taking it back man you're taking it back [Laughter] right but it can it you know you don't have to have all the equipment you can do it at home you can do simple extractions at home and people should try if you're a home grower definitely try to do that go to the store go to the dispensary buy some see what theirs is like and then try to mimic it right yeah 100 there's a lot of information out there on the web these days uh you can follow an array of guys on instagram too um that are really interested it seems like in letting people know how to do this i gather a lot of information just from perusing instagram man following people that i look up to that i know we're doing big things out here in the industry and you know if you're familiar with colorado's or rosin scene you know who i'm talking about but you can find some information out there don't be scared of it man you can get the equipment relatively easy and it's relatively easy to use and you know learning curve with anything i mean don't expect you know just get it and then all of a sudden you know you got what you but it takes a little bit but you curiosity man you got to want to do it you know you got to be about it that's all i'm going to say you know like yeah you know if like if you like extractions and you like smoking extractions and you have access to flour and you know you have opportunity to do it you're in a state that allows you to do it i say do it absolutely i believe that state can be a state of well-being 100 so uh yeah get out there grow some weed man make some extract of it roll some joints with it yeah pass it along to your friends and your family and then grow some more do it yeah keep it going man keep it down great chat with you man likewise man i really appreciate you having me it's uh you know really an honor being on this show and i you know sharing the information that i possess here which you know take it for what you want but uh yeah man you know what i love about you man is next year you're gonna be on a totally different plane with this we should do another one next year and see where you're coming out with it you just learned so much you're like a sponge man i'll come out there i'll i'll come see you in okc next year we'll do it out there oh yeah hey absolutely we'll we'll uh yeah man we'll make some we meant to make some this year but it didn't work out just yeah that's what that makes yeah we'll get it going man no

it chris man i miss you guys likewise man it was good chatting with you this morning thanks again this is uh chris with solely solvent list how can how can people look you up chris oh you can find us on instagram uh we're a solely dot solving lesson that's s-o-u-l-y dot solventless pretty easy to find yeah man so we not solving this um check us out we got some you know good things happening here very soon and uh yeah be on the lookout for us thanks again chris man appreciate it thank you and have a good one too oh man i tell you after that episode i want to sit back and uh vape up some some good solventless extractor maybe even go back and get myself some bubble hash and sprinkle some on a nice large joint you know i think i might have ruined myself that extract years ago by making uh trainwreck keefe joints and and train wreck bubble hash joints i probably lost a couple years smoking dust and i hope you guys learned a lot about extracts and solventless extracts today you know they're they're they're not dangerous they're safe it's just water um not that like hydrocarbon products are dangerous either but but many people have an aversion to them but hey you shouldn't if you're interested in you know uh solventless extracts or bubble hash man you should try something if you can make it at home you can buy a lot of the materials online you can always check us out at

you guys a little bit of info on the 710 labs list so makes you guys we're coming if he knew hit that subscribe button for your boy and make sure you dab what's the deal boys y'all already know what's happening man I'm coming back with another quick video me give you a little bit of information about what's going on here so as you guys can see I got my delivery from the list this right here came from 7-10 labs personally they hand-delivered me this package full of bomb ass extracts and whatever else I ordered that you guys are must take a look up right now what is the list how do you get on the list where is the list man it sucked because actually the list is currently only available in California now the list was made for only friends family and true OGS of the 710 community you can go to 710 labs.com and find out how you can apply for the list sometimes it's open sometimes it's closed with 710 labs actually does is put some of their best production of every month to the side for people who are on the list if you're on that list then you pretty much get dibs before any dispensary in California that's supposed to get their supply for the month or whatever so once you get on that list you have first dibs on all the stuff that 710 labs made for that month on a certain day of every month 710 labs is gonna email you a link and the password you use that password to sign in on the website that they sing you and then there goes the whole list of everything for that month you have to be careful because whatever you pick and you purchase you cannot change you have to spend the minimum of $300 and the maximum is whatever your tolerances for recreational use the max that can deliver is 8 grams of concentrates so you can only get 8 grams of rosin or you know dabs or whatever if you're a medical user that you can actually get up to 50 grams and the same goes for the flower if your recreational user that you can only pick up one ounce of flower twenty eight point five grams and if you're a medical users you can actually pick up eight ounces of flour so that's pretty fired they actually delivering a lot of cities up in Northern California and here in Southern Californians they deliver in a couple cities as well so that's gonna do the basics of the list let's get right into the package as you can see they delivered it in this nice sick ass bag labeled 7/10 Labs has 710 labs on both sides and you can actually take the bag apart if you would like to or you can just keep it together and you know rock it like a little duffel bag and on the side right here has the perfect note that this got a 710 labs booklet and you actually got this handwritten note so it's gonna be a handwritten note with your name on it big old paragraph talking about yeah you get it what's the dilly it's very dope you told me I'll [ __ ] with that how they just write you a note and [ __ ] with your order that's pretty sick that's like a lot of love so as you can see you got two zippers right here we're just gonna zip them fangs openness in this inside you might want to check all the compartments cuz you know how smokers get man they end up putting joints all in the cutting [ __ ] but uh yes so here you got ice packs this is gonna be a 710 labs ice pack which is pretty [ __ ] sick yes and then you have all your rosin or whatever that's you ordered you have your whole order in here if you got flour that I'm pretty sure the flour being here to anchor no flour on this order and sometimes they give you goodies and [ __ ] so sometimes you might have like a pair of socks or a t-shirt or whatever they're giving out for the month you might have something special you might have some couple of joints like you never know so just check the whole compartment and as you can see man I put in a pretty nice order because the prices are ridiculous I mean wholesale you're paying forty-five fifty dollars for a gram I mean you can't get this quality anywhere for this price usually I go half with my homie he'll get like two hundred dollars worth of things I got like $100 worth of things argue like 150 he'll get 150 or whatever the cases and then you film it'll be easier on both of us and get some high quality [ __ ] for the good price and we can still be on the list because if you actually don't order if you start like skipping your orders and like not ordering anything because the minimum is too high or whatever or whatever your case is like you're on vacation or whatever the cases if you keep missing out on making the orders and they're gonna cancel you from the list so you guys got to keep placing the orders I mean they do it at a very good time I would say it's pretty convenient like monthly it's not like every week or every two weeks you gotta put in $300 so um it's really like right around the time you got a smoke if you just save all your money and then make the order then that order should last you for like the whole month or until next time you have to order you'll probably even have some [ __ ] left over so I think it's really convenient especially if you have a buddy that's really interested in these products or whatever just interested in high quality [ __ ] and I want some new [ __ ] they can put it in the order they got all type of [ __ ] as you can see from [ __ ] dabs rosin bunting BHO they got joints they got dad pins like they got the high quality spires if they got the high [ __ ] bomb-diggity flour they got everything but um I only got Rosalyn because right now they didn't have anything on the list that spiked flour and they have any flour on the list all they had was rosin and dabs and joints but uh yeah maybe next time I'll get some flour this is what I picked up man I picked up some Munson number 58 I picked up some [ __ ] called the loot it's gonna be a Percy live rosin another Percy live Rosalind called greasemonkey number 15 times bootylicious number 1 I picked up a regular live rosin another month's in 58 some of these are gonna be doubles because where they're like 45 bucks each so it was like why not I got the live rosin and sour tangi times bootylicious whoo that was like another what $45 one sour tangi bootylicious again I'm telling you the Lemonheads number four so you get a good make sure you get a chain you get to change it up and [ __ ] and then you get to you know pay a really good price so the booklet man you got a couple of Snickers I believe up in here oh they give you your receipt as well and then they just show you how to smoke this [ __ ] the right way so you got the weed instructions you got all the rosin and dad and live Persis and different types of [ __ ] that they make these got the instructions behind them and stuff so I really respect that they put a lot of love and hard work into the [ __ ] versus people who just give you a box of weed or whatever like yes that's what that is like they actually care what they're doing with their [ __ ] so that's pretty tight you know I'm pretty happy I made the list so that's pretty much it man you film you got your [ __ ] you got on the list you got your [ __ ] you pay cash and then that's it they come they pull up they text you they're like yo you want us to come at this time or this time and you blow yeah come at this time they'd like alright then and actually come right on time too and they keep this [ __ ] in good condition though it's cold it's frozen it's ready to go in the freezer or in the fridge or whatever it's ready to get smoked I really [ __ ] with that so man that delivery service is a [ __ ] one anybody on the list make sure you hop on that damn list boy I know y'all enjoying that [ __ ] because this shouldve sick as hell you got the bag you got the ice packs there's nothing I can really say man but if you guys mention his video I appreciate y'all for watching guys we're coming if you knew hey that subscribe button for ya boy it makes you get to an incident excellency [Music]", "hdQt-Ej-2Ho": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with tokentim420 this is a florida medical marijuana review for those over the age of 18 and medical marijuana patients all right like say hi to everybody out there if you haven't subscribed hit that subscribe button down there leave me a thumbs up thumbs down let me know how you're feeling tonight what you're smoking on token on what you're moved in um so today we got the token tim's mad scientist lab we are going to be making some rosin vape carts on our own save a lot of money um i will like give a shout out real quick um i got some of that girl scout cookie now this stuff was only coming in at 15 it was minnie's i couldn't see that online um and i'm not a fan of girl scouts but this stuff totally changed my mind this stuff's real good um nice flavor to it nice high to it not quite a sativity ah as sativa leaning as the last stuff i've had that was the girl scout cookie so like i said not bad at all all right so we're gonna make our own rosin vape carts now you guys know i've tried true leaves i just went and got another one we got the skunk ape blue river rosin we tried both of them for cure leaf i left the other box in there from the select um some people was asking if this was live resin or not to me it didn't really taste like that tastes more like the terpene like the cannabis infused terpene vape pens exactly like them so if you could find those vape pens cheaper i'd go with them but we're going to show you a way to do it real cheap and i tell you what they taste amazing all right so we squirted a little distillate in there i got i was trying some of them i got a little tore up had to take a break my water cooled off so it didn't work so this is take two on the video honestly um that's that papaya cake rosin from move or from true leave sorry um in there and then the distillate we're using because it's an indica uh the indica uh bubba kush coming at 78 percent so all i did was microwave some water and a shot glass put it in there you don't want to get it up past the stopper there you don't want to get back in there i want to get this part done before it cools off again so there was probably about three left in here on this syringe it's got a little bubble but it was about at three i put a little bit in there already so when it's warmed up it's just gonna go real easy in there yeah i guess we're gonna use all of it all right that's all of it are all that we're gonna mess with getting out at the moment now if you notice the pad i'm using is that five dollar baking sheet which is silicone so it's the same thing as a dab mat that i got on amazon it was like five bucks or two for five i can't remember videos if you go back as while back i just cut a piece off to fit the table so i didn't have to clean the whole table off so now all we're going to do is we're going to take this and we're going to mix it up now i have made a few of these before i did warm the rosin up on the one and then by time i got out here it was just kind of like a hardened back up more like a caramel just letting it sit out at room temperature seems to work better let me pull it off the view for a second and make sure i got it mixed evenly sometimes the distillate wants to stay on the side but as you know the rosin carts are about 60 bucks apiece and they're only half grams so this distillate i believe was 60 bucks from grow healthy which truly has them for 60 most everybody's around the 60 mark for a full gram so this right here will fill two vape carts um and then the rosin's uh 75 gram so you basically for 135 you're getting two grams um which you would only get one gram buying it by the vape cards like i said these are half gram vape carbs these aren't full grams only half grams if you also notice on true leaves the thc is always really low i'm using 80 distillate and 80 um rosin so these are still up in the 80 percent so we're gonna use our um we had some la confidential co2 cart which i got another one of these so we will be reviewing it later then all we're going to do is unscrew the top here now i will say that it helps to have a decent dab tool the dab tool i'm using is the one i got for five dollars uh from banger supply and if you use code token tim you'll save 10 at banger supply they got these for like 5.99 so try to keep it up here in the camera see what we can do so mainly what we're going to do is we're going to take the flatter end um or either end the flatter end kind of works better towards the end and we're just going to get a glob out there like that this stuff's stringy and looking in the camera is a pain in the butt all right we'll hold that there and then what i do is just press it around the stem and then put it down in there so let me go over here and do this where you guys can still see it but yeah you guys can see it there now i'm gonna go ahead and use the flat end just kind of scoop out a big scoop like that and then smooth on that thing and it's easier just to push it right down in there you guys can see that just kind of pushing it down now it doesn't go real good um so there is a trick we'll use here in a second once we get it pretty blobbed up all right trying to it's hard for me to focus i need new glasses so i keep pulling it off the frame to me to be able to see it now i'm just scraping all the gunk out of the jar real good i'm gonna do the same thing i'm gonna go over to a clear spot each time and just wipe it off on that and then take the tool focus there we go and slide it down that thing it's not wanting to focus if it does go on the outside just scoop it back up all right we've got about all of it now the first one i tried to wait for it to go down and it just didn't seem to go down quick enough so i'm gonna take a little torch and i'm gonna heat the glass down in here i'm not gonna heat the concentrate i'm just gonna do it like that without burning my fingers off hopefully so i'm just going to slightly warm the glass going around you can see it's starting to drip there where we warmed it up so just real quick that one bubbled on me and then it starts to it'll just start to run down in there then go ahead and take the tool and access there's a little bubble there we're going to pop that scrape all that off on there try not to get it inside there for sure we've already got it about half full it doesn't take a lot um a lot of concentrate that is you can see i only had about three in that syringe and i only put a couple dabs in there it really wasn't a lot so again we're going to take a little bit sometimes with this i can just scrape it right across the glass or like i said just roll it around that and whatever's left there the mouthpiece fits real tight over that silicone ring and it just pushes everything else down let's get a real good scrape on this jar real quick and then i'll show you the other ones i made and talk about them a little bit now i will say the flavor on this stuff is just amazing it tastes just like just like doing the dab let's scrape this off of there real quick all right now i could play around and get some more out there but i want with you guys i'll just dab that out with my dab straw later so we're going to stick that on see how it just squishes that on through there and we're going to screw that on now i found with some of them you'll have to go back again with your torch and this one's a little thicker you can see it's still thick so i'm just barely going to heat it if it starts to bubble you want to quit so i have to look at this real good and it'll take a second for the heat to transfer through to the glass still a little creamy there's still some up there at the top there we go this one must be a little thicker glass than the other one i had we're just going to hit it a few times now if you notice when we did that it kind of cleared up a little bit not a lot but so you can see the little holes down in there now where the wick is you'll see how that cleared it up some and i didn't bring the battery out i told you i got pretty medicated all right but we have made a few other ones um so i made one yeah this is it i used the move vape pen and this it worked great for about two days and the battery died and if you can see right here at the bottom it's got little um holes i thought i could take it off with a battery i grabbed it with some pliers and apparently i couldn't so i shattered it what i'm going to do is unscrew the lid i'm not going to do it now because i want the glass to fall off and then i'm going to heat the banger up and i'm going to put it in there upside down like that and just let all that wax come out now this was the um i used the skunk ape and the bubba kush um the skunk ache ape was from move or true leave again sorry i don't know i got move on the head now i did put some of the thca powder in that one also and it was really really really tasty tasted just like the skunk ape tastes a lot better than the skunk ape rosin car which we'll get we'll have a video on that later but like i said really really really tasty um and the thc is going to be up there and it's a cheaper cheaper thing so i'll show you the other one i did but first we got to do it sorry it's alive all right so i did make a live resin vape cart um this is with moves rainbow train wreck and you can see how it's cleared up a little bit more i hit it with a little bit more of the torch um but it tastes amazing there's a little clog there that's why heated this one up it was clogging a little bit but man it tastes amazing and the high on there i'm telling you the high is better than any of these vape pens i've had yet and i gotta write what i put on this one so i don't forget that's the rainbow train wreck which we know it's live rosin because that's all there is um but the skunk ape one i'm telling you you know vape card even these i hit these um you know 10 good hits off of them to catch a little buzz um i was only hitting that skunk ape three three little hits and i was blasted i the dying i made that i rolled up a joint um and after my three hits i had like this much left of the joint and i looked at that i'm like hey no way i'm lighting that thing back up so it tore me up pretty good so if you guys want to give it a try like it's not really messy you do have a little bit of residue left in these so you could either take a bud and roll it around in there and then roll in some keep and make your own moon rock or you could just take your dab straw and hit it you could also take a hair dryer and melt it down so it would get it in a corner better to get a little better dab out of it but if i mess around with it with like this one that has that little scoop on the end i can pretty much get everything out of that jar there won't be anything left and especially it's starting to cool off now because it's getting ready to rain here but especially when i'm working in a hot garage and it pretty much stays warm here anyways it makes it easier to work with it's not coming back up so it's easier like i said just to push push it all the way around to the corners i just take this one the longer straighter one and get the sides like that and what i'll do with this is dab it that's what i do with the other stuff that's why i mark the charge but i think it rub keeps rubbing off with my fingers so that one's uh we just made the papaya cake so that was this one we're just gonna put a pea on the jar so i remember but yeah that's what i'll just use when i come out tonight i'll scrape that again you can see like i said i just got that little bit i wiped off on the edge there just by taking it around a little bit and just keep scraping it back on the side and then when you get enough to take a dab you just take it all off of there and dab away and like i said with the other with the rounded one it works a little better getting everything out there real good this one's not bad but the other one's better so like i said it doesn't take long to get you a dab and then just drop the dab tool in the dab rig and you're good so that's my take on making my own vape cards um the live resin i did use the co2 true clear the sherbert so i figured it'd have a nice cleaner flavor but this stuff here wasn't bad um i haven't tried this one i just made yet of course i didn't bring the battery out um but i used it with a skunk 8 but that skunk cape's got such a strong skunky um smell to it it's hard to for anything else to come through so we'll see if anything comes through on this one but like i said the thca powder worked great in there too it didn't clog that one up that one worked you know it was almost all the way full and you can tell see there's not much left in there i smoked over half of it in a couple days it was so tasty and like i said the battery just quit on me so i don't recommend refilling those the reason i refilled this one and like i said we got it filled with just that little bit i didn't use a lot i'll show you how much i used on that um but this one's got the charging port on the bottom so hopefully we can recharge it when it does die now i only use this was a full gram i did lick a little bit and but pretty much i just used two i pushed it from where it was at the one to maybe just past the eight so maybe three milliliters of this stuff but closer to probably the two because it did fill that pin up and it's only 300 milligrams so like i said it didn't take much of this to fill that vape in and i did dab a little bit in my mouth dabbed a little bit in the banger just to try it the flavor wasn't bad the banger wasn't real clean so i couldn't get a good flavor on it so we'll save that for a review hopefully too well that's going to be it guys if you have any questions just leave them down there in the comments like i said this is an easy way you could also just put the distillate straight into the vape pen without the rosin and just make a bait pin that's what pretty much they're using is distillate but like i said with just a little bit of that rosin it makes it a real good flavor so you don't need a lot of that even you could probably just put maybe two little dabs in there mix it around put one in there see how you like it next time add more if you need to but like i said they tore me up good so i definitely recommend those of you who are feeling your own give this a shot let me know what you think of it that's going to be it guys we do got some more videos coming tomorrow we got a delivery coming and then we'll also do what's new in the florida mmj we got some new things coming yeah so make sure you tune in tomorrow for that one uh make sure you

"when you know that this is $75 and you're getting a big scoop of it I'm thinking to myself and that's like eight bucks right there [ __ ] it this video is for mature audience if you're not a mature audience this video is not for you what's up everybody Cubans here and today we are going to get into some rather expensive concentrates I picked up a gram of some hash rosin today that was priced at $75 and it is one of the most expensive grams of concentrate I have ever purchased so let's take a close look at what we got I've had a gram of Summit connoisseurs genetic and concentrates Tiger's milk and this stuff looks like a nice little slab of peanut butter I'm pretty excited pretty excited abot both so you can get a look at the packaging here this is that Tiger's milk and it's testing at about seventy nine percent THC and then it does have a little bit of CBD a in there but you know what I am so excited for this let's just take it down where are my clothes at let's get a nice nice little scoop here out of the email all fresh and clean and I'm gonna see how it does does [Music] um yeah that was really good I'm gonna actually throw that on a courts now I'm gonna throw that around on a few nails and see if we like it but just to compare I picked up some cheap dabs this cost 75 a gram for some hash rasen 75 bucks for this it's pretty expensive most most of my concentrates I usually find deals and get a lot of good looking stuff like this this is some live batter I got for about 15 bucks a gram one-fifth of the price now sometimes I find live sugars live diamonds of batters around that 15 to 20 dollar price if I'm getting it on a deal it's not the everyday price so begin the deal you can get this stuff cheap so it's really interesting to pay five times as much for a single gram of concentrate I can't I can't believe I did it it's still interesting to me that this costs five times as much as this other gram of some delicious looking stuff but some hash rods and it's hard to come by especially here in Colorado Springs it's not super common to find rosin hash rosin so I guess you got to pay that top dollar because it's so rare but let's get some more dabs of this cone I'm not done with this yet let's see what I'm gonna do some cold starts when you know that this is $75 and you get in a big school but I'm thinking to myself and that's like eight bucks right there okay [Music] it's throwing out a couple bucks in that [ __ ] it [ __ ] it and get a little bit more I need about three-fitty oh we got it okay okay just pricey tab right here damn it all right let's get a nice cold start here and see if it's super delicious on the court oh damn well damn okay okay that's good stuff so I just stabbed it a couple of times here and it's pretty good stuff but is it is it worth it is it worth paying five times as much as I do for some good live banner is it worth is it worth paying five times as much to get some solvent once that's basically the major difference is the fact that it's solvent list most concentrates are made with a solvent it's the easier method it's the most common method but with rosin they use heat and pressure to make it so they just basically squish the THC or they squish the extract out of the nugs or out of hash most of the time they'll make a hash and then they'll press the hash and that's what this is this is a this is hash rosin so it's a little bit more expensive and my understanding is the yield is a little bit lower it's it's a process to make the hash and then when you press the hash you wouldn't get the same type of yield as if you were doing like a butane or propane extraction so I think part of the process is it's a little bit harder to get high-quality product and you're typically going to get less with whatever amount of plant material you go into the process with so I think that affects the price it is pretty rare out here in Colorado Springs not a lot of people are pressing - I can find it in a few places some places have rosin and half chosen but it's not as common as BHO and pho and there's so many dispensaries that grow their own bud and they do their own in-house extractions so something like this I can I can pretty much get really cheap any day of the week if I'm looking around so for me to pay five times as much for this it's a little little far-fetched I honestly I'd rather have five grams of this and haven't done but yet and it's just I like volume I like to do a lot of dub so I'm gonna go back and forth on these we're gonna compare I just want to shave this I got this the same day I kick it costs literally one-fifth the price I'm just gonna see if it's if it's it if it's 20% it's good like it doesn't make oh god I just paid so much money but anyway anyway anyway yeah that's that's solid for the price that's sell it for $15 grand look um I I think it's good I think that that the rosin is good I'm gonna dab the rod let me have a bucket that was that was the I don't even know of the other strain is [Music] [Music] I mean it's definitely better [Music] the Robins better smoother and tastes a little better you can't really compare the highs because I'm better than both back for it but it's all about the taste for me and it is smoother is it pay five times the price smoother [Music] I don't think so because it's not it's not five times as good yeah I don't even know how you would get five times as give it something like this this isn't the best this isn't the best cheap batter that I've got but for something to be five times as good as this would be pretty impressive so this is not five times as good probably not worth five times the price if I see it on deals I may get it but I don't think it's worth anything that's worth three times the price two times the price even thirty forty five bucks I get why it costs so much it's a it's a little bit less common not as many people are making it and you get lower yields with it I get why it it costs more but it's not currently it's not at the price point where it's super worth it for me to only buy rosin maybe if I had a press and I could get amazing yields myself but I don't grow and I don't have any interest in growing so it's like I don't have to buy all my nugs anyway to smash it so kind of interesting I like finding deals so maybe I'll get excited about finding a deal in the future but yeah this isn't actually the most expensive gram of concentrate I've ever purchased a few years ago I remember purchasing a I purchased several grams actually a full melt bubble hash that I got remember the dispensary but I got some full melt bubble I think it was about eighty eight bucks a gram I think I remember paying just under ninety a gram it was really really good stuff it was like some of the craziest stuff I ever spent I I gotta go back and look for some pictures of it cuz it was a few years ago those full mount bubble hash grams I got were like pretty good but after I got a mouse this isn't worth eighty eight bucks a gram what the [ __ ] did I just do so I kind of feel that way here what the [ __ ] that I just do but we made a video that's what the [ __ ] we just did so let's do a few more dabs of this [ __ ] might as well I've only taken out several dollars off of it I don't see if we can take several more I'm interested in the cold start here so let's do that [Music] here's a few dollars [Music] yeah this is good stuff still I wish I could afford you dabs well this was actually pretty fun and I'm pretty blessed after all those naps and I'm glad I

18 get out of here all right like say hi to everybody out there hi to new subscribers old subscribers and you know soon-to-be subscribers that's right that's you if you haven't hit that button hit that subscribe button now leave me a thumbs up and a comment and I guess hit that Bell I guess their Bell says that [ __ ] too alright we got a one plant a video for you today I never did show the flower I got so we'll do that and we're gonna review the live rosin resident rosin it's live something alright we did pick up a little what the heck is it open Ella berry pie this is an indica leaning hybrid I believe come in at 15% not bad I've been smoking on this one got a little bit of that purple in there not bad trichomes not covered like some of them have been here lately but one thing I do like about one plants they got those tamper resistance on there so you never have to worry about somebody else opening it up in the store sticking their big gnarly nose in there and dropping a booger in their nose hair God knows what else some people like to open these in the store I don't like the fact that they can open them in the store because like I said you never know who's stuck their schnauzer in there goes no I don't want the cookies got a little purple in there too mmm smells good there's a big mug in here it looks like our two baby nugs having sex something I don't see that sit down there oh and if you guys aren't on instagram check me out on instagram well if you're not on history and get on Instagram I know a lot of people said they're bored sitting at home don't have anything to do this is the time to learn something new figure out Instagram it's not that hard you don't have to be yourself you can block your profile so nobody even can see who you are and I do a lot more bong rips and stuff like that on there because my camera is up on a box there way down here so I can reset the camera and shoot like a 10 second clip of taking a hit I'll stop and you can see the function I could do slo-moes over there and just edit the whole video to sort set the camera up to slow-mo and do one slow-mo video and be done so I don't have to edit anything still so just throwing that out there like so if you guys aren't on Instagram get on there this is a good time like I said if you're stuck at home bored there's a lot of giveaways on there a lot of live feeds I was on there live with or I wasn't on their proper major quality did a live thing and I joined in on the live talking to him a couple other ones was in there Liz was in there so it's a nice little platform you see a lot of other people that make comments on the videos they're usually on Instagram stuff like that speaking of that that Liz the one that introduced me to the bowls from Harold lumen or whatever it was she just wanted some smudge oh screens and a real nice little I think it's a recycler it kind of looks small like the MJ Arsenal rigs there was a different brand so like I said there's a lot of different stuff on there also while your home board this is a good time if you thought about trying something or learning something the Internet's out there you can learn almost anything on the internet so this would be the time my friend to learn all that crap and guess about it they'll add some more stuff to say and usually I do but at the same time I smoke before the video instead of during the video this time so having some memory issues there's that Darth Raven that stuff doesn't look good that's my new tray from the fat-ass glass sick little design like I said it this is like a greyish purple but it's look good alright now let's talk about the live resin rosin let me pop this back in here do a little whole pack of that for that their containers are weird I keep one to turn it upside down I keep thinking the whites on the bottom and that's the lid but it's not the lids plastic so it's live rosin like I am so like I said the lids plastic the glove the jars of glass with some kind of like reflective on it and then it's painted black or something like that it might have been a sticker but I don't see anything under there so weird little jars she haven't used some of it it smells good as note that's coming right it does have a good smell to it taste not so much and I think the reason being is this is the take a lid off this was the organic blend coming in at 73 percent so this was a blend of Kim D which is Kim dog see if I can multitask and break up a little nugge and take a hit to get a little more forgetful time I take this out jarred it looks like less flour so it's the rosin the live rod now this is live rosin so they freeze the plants right off as soon as they come down they don't dry them out they're still green wet and they freeze them and then they come back and pretty I'm pretty sure they make bubble hash out of that so they do it through the screens and then they press the bubble hash into rosin so that being said that's a blend it skim dog evany Kim dog which is a hybrid evany and ivory which is a sativa leaning hybrid strawberry maraschino which is mainly a sativa and vanilla berry pie which is an indica leaning hybrid so it's got a regular hybrid a sativa hybrid a sativa and an indica hybrid for one I would have thought that would have been fire now might not taste great but you know me and my combos I like the combo DUP I get better relief on combos this I didn't get that I smoked a wax joint with us in it and did three dabs at the same time and still wanted to come back out in the garage and do something else so it didn't hit as hard as you would have thought it would have especially for having like I said four different varieties in there now here's what I know I know I did a lot of ohms sorry guys the maraschino cherry they haven't had that in stock in a while so I don't know whatever they grew this last time they just put straight to concentrate or if that's something that's been in the freezer for a while I don't know if that has something to do with it if there's a shelf life on frozen bud I'm not an expert in that department I've never froze any bud flower really doesn't last around long enough to be frozen but like I said in the taste it didn't have I won't say it had a bad taste cuz it wasn't bad tasting at all it was just I think a little too much going on in there you could taste some of that Kim D which I'm not a I've never really had the Kim D but I've had the Kim Seba and they said all the Kim's kind of have that same gassy kind of taste to them kind of something similar to a gorilla glue or something like that so you definitely get that Kim taste in there and probably the next thing that you could probably tell in there would be that vanilla berry pie and then there is a little hint of strawberry in there but like I said it's more of a jumbling so I just think there's too much flavor in it I wasn't impressed for the hundred and five dollars that stuff cost luckily it was on sale or what on sale but I use code new fam for 25% off your delivery we will take a dab of it though yeah it's only ten minutes then we'll do a dad real quick and we'll call that one my new rig here I got the temperature down this one rather quickly usually it takes me a while to get the temperatures going on these things and some of them I still never quite all the way on some of them I still caught my butt off when I take a hit this one I'm doing a little better also I got this in there should have done this at the beginning of the video this is a splitter so you can do two at a time anybody ever use these what are you using for do you use them - dabs or to use - for flour or do you do a dab in a flour which is best let me know down there in the comments I've never used one so I have no experience with that so like I said if you guys have used one let me know I'm really digging this new down beret go use the m'kay Arsenal one a few times still haven't quite got the temperatures down on it yet or the times still making me coffee a little bit I can clean that one quite as good as I should have last time it was late last night while I was smoking will use the carrot dabber which is kind of nice it stands up on its little stem it works real good for the goopy stuff of course once you use it once and it gets a little goopy on there because it always leaves a little resin you can pick up wax and/or crumble and stuff like that I was doing it the other day this one's almost cooled off so we'll take a DAB and it will probably call that a video so if you guys haven't subscribed make sure you subscribe if you want to try one plan out try them out for yourself use that code new fam for 25% off online orders also they got stir-crazy that's going until I think the 15th of the next month you guys see that very little coughing too soon that one is working pretty good I just said the flavors not bad I would like to try this in something else besides the Kim the Kim dog or the blend that's all I did see on the site that the Kim dog ran out before I got on there but the blend was all they had left so and like I said this is a live resin so it's going to be green plants frozen then made bubble hash I believe and then press that bubble house into rosin take one more hit out of this that's my the pipe from the fatass glass Bert 420 also has one similar to that but is yellow with more bumps on it I like mine better it's like a blue rooster or something little punk rocker with some [ __ ] up hair alright guys hope everybody's doing good out there we've got some more wax videos coming up this week cuz we bought a lot of wax cuz that's the only thing we can stock up on we can only get so much flour in our 35 days you know that so I really didn't want to keep going back and forward to dispensaries so I got a lot of wax last week so we'll have some more reviews coming I do have a weed box too and open up we might do that tomorrow or the next day it's sitting over here in the corner begging to be opened up and you know me I got open that thing up so hopefully everybody's doing good this videos for XP DJ he wanted to see the live resin review sorry it was a little better like I said it's not bad it's just got a lot flavor in there and it doesn't hit as hard as you would have thought it would be for four of them in there it's really kind of a mellow hi to it to be honest so that's gonna be it guys until next time I don't have a join but keep on poking my friends", "8yWpvcl5SUY": "welcome to community canvas reviews today i'm going to be reviewing a white label live resin cartridge um i had a bezel i think it was or bevel one of the two um bezel there we go i had a bezel distillate cartridge in and i just kind of got bored of it honestly because the terps are not very strong part of it being um they're not cannabis derived terpenes so live resin should spice that up um the live resin that i got is actually less terpy than the uh or it has less terpenes total we'll see what it tastes like anyways but less total terpenes than um uh cured resin surprisingly but either way we'll try it out it's wedding cake which is an indica this is cultivated by green queen farms and it comes in at 84.05 total cannabinoids um and 5.39 total terpenes um yeah so i'll read the terpenes and show you what it looks like but first let me flip the camera around for you [Music] uh [Music] all right let's try this out step one take off the sticker all right um first that's the thing about some good live reds and this um just some i don't know yeah some just good live resin cartridges i can smell that one no leakage whatsoever perfect seal that just smells nicely very sweet and almost like perfumey that's some interesting elements there so it's got a pretty basic um oh yeah that's it's got painting in there a bit smells kind of piney slash perfumey mostly but the leading terpenes and are the basic um are pretty standard beta cardio filling at two point zero four two percent uh limiting at one point five percent humiliate at zero point six percent um beta mir seen at 0.5 alpha pinene at 0.18 cedrine at 1.7 or 0.17 um alpha vista bologna at zero one point zero point one six and finch all at 0.127 so they always have a very detailed um terp list right there but usually a lot of the ones at the end are in pretty low amounts i don't think i can ever really taste them that already smells like it's gonna be way better than the other one was so um got two uh little silicone caps and the branding on this is c cell c240 620 but yeah proper c cell so that's always good um so first thing it's very very clear and light that happens with some white label um i think part of them being just like they they get stuff from different cultivators a whole lot just depends on who cultivated it what the starting material was like i think and white label actually as far as i know white label means like whenever there's um a producer doing white label extracts it means that they're doing extracts for other growers stuff instead of their own stuff so i think they've just made a name of that and that's just like their process but that's usually what that means so um i answered on reddit recently somebody posted a live resin cartridge by white label that was also very clear and wondering if it was real and also they had someone tell them that it was delta eight but they also said it looks like it has delta eight terpenes in it which if you know much about cannabinoids that's not even how that works so um but they came on reddit to verify it and i posted some cured resin and live resin that looked similar and that's just how white label is sometimes i don't know if it's crc i know they seriously well i don't know that but i'm pretty sure they crc some of their dabs so maybe they do their cards as well um i've never had a card that was remotely bad they always put out really good stuff and it's priced a little higher than some of the other stuff i get so i don't get it as often but part of that is it's higher quality too so i don't think they do it badly so all right so here's wedding cake yeah that smells it's just like a general sweet smell it's um i feel like there's like a very even smell of like the pinene and it's like limonene and something else that i don't know which i actually want to say is one of these terpenes in a lower amount and i definitely smell pining at 0.184 so i think i'm smelling one of these other ones either alpha cedric and alpha visceral or pinchol um i'm pretty sure finch all taste i've had finching which i assume is pretty similar just in this last buddies card i had and that was very like like so i don't think it's that probably i've had uh visible alone i think that's pretty sweet and i don't know about cedrine let's see about taste and smell okay upon hitting it you just get a very a much more pronounced and very standard like weed taste um i say that like it means a lot um a very just like nice balance between uh earthy and herbal and like um vaguely like musky taste to it uh not really musky someone says like the other two though um yeah it just tastes like weed usually does for most streams and don't stand out anyways uh that's how i remember wedding cake to be too i've had wedding cake from a couple different producers never a live resin so that's kind of cool but i've had select elites and that's just distillate with their terpenes and tasted pretty similar yeah so um it's not a a real standout strain to me um things like that are like mandarin cookies and like or tropicana cookies was a really good one or blueberry muffin um things like that usually stand out more to me than like wedding cake where sometimes you have strains that really do taste a little bit like what they're named and then you have stuff like wedding cake where i feel like there's maybe more behind the name or they just thought oh that's a good name for it or something like that um sounds pristine or primo or something like that very good very good but doesn't taste quite like wedding cake and the terpenes don't really stand out to me yeah those terps linger very nicely um very present unlike the non-cannabis drive terpenes that were in the last one that's why i switched it out though um i'll have the other one as a reserve in case i run out or can't get any more or something but wow this is nice and the effect on it very nice and full body too um a really good live rise and that's a good thing about the stream too is it um it's just well-rounded very well-rounded so sometimes something being well-rounded enough can make me be interested in it a little more if it doesn't stand out because sometimes that's what i'm looking for like right now for example and the perks of having a proper c cell at that vapor production all right so that's hitting pretty nice i'm getting some aftertaste again but i think it's some of those terpenes or maybe just all the mixing together but it's nothing really strong it's just so so much of like so little it's hard to describe but mostly just like um i'm getting some herbal tastes and some earthy taste like i said and i'm also getting like a weird i almost want to describe it as like how talcum powder smells that's a weird freaking thing but like it's like a very like reminds me of like a rocky taste or something i haven't tasted rocks so i don't know but that's what i imagine rocks to taste like i don't know if that's uh it's not a bad thing too it's very interesting i have to wonder what um alpha cedrine is like the effect is very nice and terps are just they stand out very nicely as they should with some live resin so yeah i think i'm starting to repeat myself a bit so i'm going to close it out here with some smoke rings at least one of those was a ring i'm pretty sure alright thanks for watching uh like and subscribe if you want and stay tuned and um yeah i'm a lot more interested in the cured resin this one's kind of a placeholder but the in the cured resin is a josh d strain which i've done a little bit of reading about because my name is josh as well so i thought that was interesting enough and he has some pretty good uh good-looking stuff and it's a josh d strain extracted by white label and it has more terpenes more cannabinoids more thc cbd um all of it really just seems like a better cartridge honestly it was cheaper i probably should have just got two cured resin cartridges um but yeah stay tuned for that one that'll come around in the next day or two so thanks for watching like and subscribe and stay tuned for more", "3IIvPYyCmZc": "everybody how you doing I know it's a little late but we're gonna do what I promised we're gonna press a half ounce of this African Thai okay I've got the flour completely rehydrated with spinach leaf it's ready to go sure you can see it right here make sure that can you see it there in the camera it's looking good yeah good people see them how nice it's glistening in there yes it is Jake how is it keep it in focus by pressing the screen right where it's at so it refocuses on the flower you see that yes okay I'm gonna get closer how's that yep yeah that's a half-ounce african time this stuff is ringing in at thirty four point eight percent okay let's go - lets go strength so we got the CRD kt20 trip tech rosin press at 200 degrees I'm using a duly tech 160 micron 14 gram bag and we're gonna load this thing up this spinach leaf is crucial to rehydrating this flower and when you see the kind of yield we're gonna get from it you'll understand why I tell people over and over again you got to get your flower right to get the most out of it out of Raza okay I I don't can't say it enough I hate to have people come by and they bring me flattered and I can't press inform but sometimes that happens and that's cool I mean you know lesson learned and and but I've got this stuff rehydrated to the proper moisture content and no I don't use a moisture you know gadget to figure that out this is a craft I do this by experience by feel I get a little finger - who cares it's my medicine yeah you know I'm pressing for another patient I wear gloves because you know it's their stuff you know anything I'm pressing on cameras is either mine or it's a customer that doesn't care whether I wear gloves or not because they know I you know good steward of this plant if but this stuff is so soft I mean it's it's amazing in the yeah but it didn't mess with the herbs in fact I think the extra moisture on the springs really brought them out kind of like when you're in a shower you're not gonna have that moisture hits your nose and saturates everything you know that's it's kind of the process here so you see even though this bag isn't really designed isn't isn't really designed for be doing bottle textile okay it's made to be flat packed but I've gotten it to adapt to where I need it to be it's just the stuff is so stinking then you know I'm coming up with finger ashes trying to get it to fill in the bag and make a slug that I can it makes it hard get between those plates right oh my gosh I love African Thai and see the thing is nine times out of ten sativas don't produce as well as indicas except for peligro up from grass roots which was an absolute gusher and this African tie is insanely insanely good on its yields when properly pressed you know and everybody has their their own temperatures that they want to depress things that I'm just doing kind of a pre squish here to get slugged up right I can't believe that was a half yeah no I know crazy huh we also saw right boy stur eyes are so now I just trimmed right I just trim about you know half to three-quarters inch above all right get rid of that don't need that this come in here watch the camera make sure that everybody can see what's going on yes okay so now we've got our slug right stage that here I'm gonna take and move this lighting over here so if you get a little nice view of this press please bear with me as I move the camera around I don't do fancy edits and stuff like that my videos are are wrong and kind of like this because I want people to see this is real life this is how I operate my results are my results you see them good or bad I don't try to hide a thing okay so I got my mic 18:20 press set up to 200 degrees I got the paper in there we're gonna take the slug there's your slug we're gonna put that in there we're gonna place together just a little bit give it okay we got it centered in there now that I got it centered in there I'm gonna bring this view in a little closer for you so bear with me as I keep readjusting the camera angle here until I get it centered so you can see what's going on okay so now if you guys want to see something cool use that as a monitor and watch because it's in maximum scale or 200 degrees and we're ready to drop the hammer on this gently okay this handle is weighted yeah so it it brings the place together in a very controlled way when I start meeting resistance and I hit my first heat soak point which is where I want to stop and let the heat start working in the material and all that moisture that we reintroduced into that flower turns to steam and forces all the good [ __ ] that's that's how this works that's why if your flower is dry and it only is from the dispensary I don't care who makes it yeah what kind of Evita packs they use see see it's starting to moist moisten up right there let's see that okay so I've got to get this ready because this stuff is going to drip when it starts producing it's going to be insane oh it is gonna be awesome happy plants treated with love pressed with care and you get some amazing medicine see every time I starts to get fuzzy just tap the screen right on it and it'll refocus yeah okay so try to get the lighting said you can continue seeing the best view of things now I'm still not at the heat some point it's already producing already starting to moisten up see on the bottom edge on the left-hand side air it's getting wet it's getting wet up top Oh she'sshe's gonna be a gusher guys tonight always I always love those gushers oh yeah African type Ellen Roya another one that's an indica though is Prime's double Afghan show yes I got my first very first time I pressed rosin was with a nut smasher mini press Preston a - that didn't rehydrate and got 1.1 brand Wow and I thought oh it's gonna be like this forever yeah it's not yeah and a lot of learning later and I'm at where I'm at now so this is something anybody can do it you could do it with a hair straightening iron but if you want to have results like this you say you need you need to love this plan do you really have to love this plan guys want to try and rely on timers and gauges and think that it's scientific this is an art not a science so you have to know what this plan is showing you look at the color the camera doesn't do it justice with the lighting I mean I get that it's super blonde yeah now you see how the handle is starting to come resistance but it's still closing the place okay slowly and not too aggressive and I don't have a blow-up my god I'm not in a hurry I want to get it flowing so that when I tipped this thing 90 degrees forward that's it's going to say I got to keep messing with the angle of the light to get it to not amber up like that it's it's always kind of a pain because it reflects off of the paper and then it throws off the camera see I get it just right look at that happy plant problem she is so happy I just hope it doesn't auto butter cuz it did that on one me on time it auto sugared up it didn't flow I think this is going to flow it I'm gonna get it that particular batches lipids aligned a certain way I mean that's what we're dealing with here that's why rosin is a much better concentrate and most of the commercial stuff because everything that's in that plant is in that Roz and I haven't taken anything out I've just removed the plant material right in the equation yeah I'm taking the soul of this plant and I'm bringing it forth it's giving me its essence and that's that's what somebody who cares about what they do can do with this plan with the right equipment now I'm going to give it a little help watch the material move look at its like lava yeah now we're gonna do something watch this guys I'm gonna back this back off right move my lighting we're gonna get it shining down on this right here because what you're about ready the season to be very cool you want the camera down there I will yeah I need the camera down there okay now we're gonna get a gravity assist and we should start seeing some tryptych real soon if you want to take your cameras guys if you want to put stuff on your phones put it on your on your Facebook just tag me okay you know make sure you tag prime make sure you tag African Thai and Ciardi okay cuz it one chance to look at that look at that look at that that's common okay look at that okay so I'm gonna take the camera at the free hand here I'm gonna bring you in and show you look at this look at underneath look that is drip tech my friends see Rd makes the best drip tech presses for prices that nobody else can deal with look at that and it's African Thai 34 for almost 35 percent thirty four point eight mile Carberry and just look at what it's given us here we rehydrated it with care and just there's look at how gorgeous that is getting nice close-ups and as soon as it gets off the heat its it gets nice and stable right away it stabilizes so it's it's gonna implant it if you ever get this stuff in a concentrate form and you try the rosin you'll know the difference just immediately in in every aspect of the flavor profile this is as close to actual plant consumption as you get everything's still there you know look how thick it is - I haven't even really started putting a ton of pressure on it yet either guessing there's so much more there is and that's why I'm not rushing this process because see I can feel when the bags getting to the point where you can't press them right so I'm trying to do this one-handed well on that well I'm still applying pressure so I'm going to let it sit there but bring this in so that you can see look at that beautiful medicine right there god I love this plan I love doing this for both myself and other patients too this is this is what brings me joy I used to think it was being a soldier but this is really the thing that's given me the most satisfaction in terms of something positive to do with my life since I was a soldier it means that much to me that's why I've dedicated myself to teaching people how to do this this is all about making better medicine when you take that flower look at that dripping look up underneath there is insane there's spider webs coming off become wet look at that look at that they crazy Oh baby wait'll they see this on you - they're gonna lose their they're gonna lose [Music] see this I said look you keep you kill back under here and you can still see it's still just gushy discussion my god is there any end to this look at this oh man I'm gonna get a record off of this I don't know but I'll tell you what biggest single eighth yield was that I got was in Detroit yeah the lockvar Wonka bars man 30.1% see I got 1.5 back from 1/8 I bought it at reef I can't remember who the grower was and I was too excited about what I was saying happened it was doing just like this it was just gushing and gushing gushing so I'm giving a little more now you see it started to slow down a bit right yeah okay that's let me know that you're the presser workers we're getting well yeah but we're also getting I'm looking at the the plates and seeing how close they're because I don't want to get a blowout and have to clean it up it's not a disaster if it happens it's just a pain in the ass I'd rather not right but getting this stuff off the heat is the whole goal of this press and you see how beautiful that is I mean just now it slowed down enough that I'm going to put the camera back at it stand here okay I'm gonna move this thing back up we're gonna tilt this back up now one two three lighting readjusted on to the plates so you can see that there's still lots of material here and I'm gonna finish off this press with I'm gonna finish off this press with ya right okay so now from this point we've gotten all the stuff that I think is gonna dripped a coffee or now I'm doing this by feeling already I can feel that I got pretty much most of it dripped out with the pressure I'm applying right now it's still applying gentle pressure in a slow measured way but I'm feeling the resistance of the bag now and if I go too much further risk of blow ahead especially with these dually tech bags they're not built as strong as those Knox master bags again I don't I'm not sponsored by these people I pay retail like everybody else does for my bags and I'm telling you nuts faster bags if you are doing bottle tech pressing like I do you can't get better bags you just can't they ain't giving me monster yields I'm looking for these last bubbles over here when those big ones pop I think we'll be just about know I know and the color is still amazing now uh one of the things that this will show you when it's ready to come off as that color will start to darken or it's gonna slow down production at maximum pressure right so right now I'm very very close to max on the pressure with this thing that I'm comfortable applying I always err on the side of quality over quantity and I still get blowouts sometimes I'm not I'm doing this like I do doesn't make you immune to making mistakes and that's why these videos when I have a boil out I don't hide that I don't edit it out you get to see how I fix the problem that's what a professional does right you come across a problem and you have the understanding of it to fix it adapt and overcome exactly look at that big look at that again love that this plant is giving us right now I mean look at this I'm giving it the last little bit of pressure than I'm comfortable you see how I'm having the weight of my arm to the weight of that bar it's not moving anymore so the longer it stays on the heat to lift stable it becomes it becomes more shatter like and then when you cool it off it turns into like ground glass and you can't gather it up because I just want to stick to it so yeah that's why the error on the side of caution and you get a better product the difference is what your philosophy is are you going after absolute quantity then you keep cooking it to death and you'll get a good quantity but it's gonna suck right my my rosin rosin and I produce from flour for other patients I would rather they get all of the terpenes all of the medicinal value out of this flour got their own process you know my way is not the only way to do this but I get pretty damn good results see the sugar the the it's crystallizing on the plates gentlemen you see yeah okay we're seeing diamonds being made on a press right now those are like many not many diamonds that this press has just made all natural now if I want to do a THC a mechanical separation this press can handle that too is just a long process ten stages low temperature high duration yeah and I don't have the money timer material to do that so until we start paying the kind of prices that they pay in Detroit I'm gonna have to wait okay so I think we're not done slowed down to the point where it's not producing a lot more it's starting to crystallize up I think we have gotten the best cut out of this plant that we can so let's drop the plate yeah all right I'm gonna move lighting over here get this can you get this kind of centered right here with the thing is bring this down that's right now here's what's gonna blow your mind people we're gonna get this have to die now a little sugar crystals that came up right on the edge you're over here too but there's a nice one right there you can get in line this puck is perfectly pressed look at that vikon any further it was haunted right out of that side scene yeah so I missed the view that but it didn't I brought it right to the edge which is what I wanted to do I didn't get that blow out yeah and that's what I was I was just rather err on that side I'll get them what's left on this putt now get back in the edibles so I don't lose a thing you know but oh my god no compared to what dripped off initially and we're going to compare the two before we weigh it and get a total new unit you see how that's turned a little green tinged if there is no because as ice going no no no this is because what dripped off was the best part of this the", "lbxe9wjChMA": "welcome back to the canvas packaging show episode 3 in this 12 part series also known as a saga we're talking about concentrates today quick reminder to subscribe to the channel we're going to be doing a lot of eco-friendly packaging in 2019 we're going to show you guys through the canvas packaging so so please subscribe and without further adieu unless Danis I need to add let's get right into the cannabis excuse me concentrate packaging Kalia has an announcement to make sure they've all going to show us the products first and then this was created by Heather the Saudi a favorite thing I've done for the concentrates in the entire you know for the last year Wego she calls her own packaging Fuego Johnson a good sky by the way shot up the sky shot at the skies Str jar it fits through the card Co dry it can hang it's very cost-effective it shone like the spot UV if you can can you see that on there this thing's getting a lot of compliments all right next up show it like unwrapping it on the actual show you don't have to unwrap that actually it's just it's just the bow just about yeah holding backs to put your jar in all your warnings on there it's a Massachusetts product all right keep this moving League that's the same concept just another is a flap here that you can put some branding on or a message of some sort I love that idea of how do you put a message in there that tells the story so it's like just that person holds your package and you can hit them with some kind of call to action whether it's going to your Instagram or you want to show them your tagline of what you're about so how do you tell your story through packaging is something to really think about not just a box it's a way to tell your story and it's a proven fact that I'm doing the unboxing process we talked about that a lot when you have more flaps you have more openings it's more exciting and it leads to a much lower case of buyer's remorse certainly just from having a fun experience in opening the box opening the package it's like you're opening a gift it's a true unboxing process we do a lot of the stuff in our ecommerce division and it's all about unboxing opening it up and really being pleased with what you see on the inside and half of the fun is you see on YouTube all over the place unboxing experience half of the fun is the unboxing process repeat customers that's what's gonna have people come to you again as a repeat customer versus as more dispensaries pop up down the street why would I go to you know location a versus B it's because I have that experience through their packaging and it resonates for sure alright we interrupt this program Talia please show your Christmas cookies to everyone a lot o you're interested in buying cookies for Scalia please so let's go to the chatter envelopes upgraded this has an insert in it two items from our fashion side of our business that we think could be adaptable this would be like super high but I was thinking this for shatter Irving this for a concentrate but that for shattering there's a hinge box with raw materials has an inlay and this is a flock interior which is like a by the sweater this obviously has a bracelet insert inside okay inside this box is a wood lacquer hinge box which again this was for a ring but we can make an insert for your jars really nice pause would I don't know if it shows up on camera but a gorgeous gorgeous almost like a mirror finish polished would non contempo sample don't have to be a different size but just I really like the opening and the magnetic closure and the material to the materials are a huge thing that plain to the brand overall so it's not just the design on the box with the material selection and I see a lot of people in the industry just choosing standard 18 point board with four color process for color print and the textures are great way to tell the story of what you're about where you premium will then use a premium texture are you eco-friendly are you natural then use a natural craft field so keep materials in mind this is a similar example it has a magnet in it this is the box for makeup it has a mirror inside but it has that nice snap closure type of box that you will not throw out like Dan was talking about knowing the experience and knowing what her customers going to do after he makes the purchase or she makes the purchase sometimes you want to just have a package that's going to contain and after you've thrown away other times if you really want to make it whether it's giftable or you just want to add to the experience you've designed packaging that's not going to be thrown away that's going to be kept with the life cycle of the product or even after that so an item like that with a mirror on it could be put on the desk has your brand on it forever and again the customer connects with it you know for years and years and years to come I see that was like a five milliliter concentrate jar would look really nice than that that that concept okay what do you anyone say about this all right so this is just sort of a aspirational or concept that we haven't really tested but we're thinking a concept issue to have shatter inside of there I want to see if you guys think that would be viable this is the concept that we did for the fashion industry we had a floating ring box and I think a lot of people like to see shatter they like to see how clear it is right how transparent it is I'm thinking that could be a really really cool option to display these Nick what do you think that was actually your idea about the your set you're telling me about like the transparent nature like to see you know the purity of it how transparent is honestly I think that's a great idea I think that would be really unique and different okay I guess this episode is over because our helpers just run out the door and she's back alright anyone have anything else to add in the concentrates you guys things you're seeing in the market that would be worth sharing with the audience or do we kind of hit everything and everything about the boxes we have a customer that were conceptualising packaging for now that wants to make sure that whoever is using her packaging moving forward can fit it in their pocket or if you're using it for a pre-roll or concentrate that they can take one of the tubular ones and actually turn it into carry your joint to a concert or going somewhere else where they are just having it a nice box to fits easily in their pocket like chapstick with so I think that that's really important for people to try and not keep in mind too when they're designing their packaging is the smaller the better and you know people can use it more than once that's really going to be the best-case scenario mm-hmm oh great I think especially with the primary packaging so like I think a lot of this stuff people could have a box they're gonna keep that primary package on then like fit it in their pocket I think that you hear that a lot that's definitely a common thing what is it going to be like for the person who's carrying the product how do you have that seamlessly integrated to their lives the cookie was great and a little rude eating on camera I could see someone writing the comments this guy's eating on camera but I'm sorry to you whoever's gonna call me out on that", "OtFh3Bz-TQs": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with token to him 420 this is a medical marijuana review for those over the age of 18 you're not 18 go away all right guys like say hi welcome back if you haven't subscribed hit that button leave me a thumbs up thumbs down let me know what you're feeling what you're smoking on I got a little Tillamook strawberry here about three o'clock is my first joint of the day guys know I've been feeling good I don't wait that long for a wake-and-bake easily mmm but I am feeling a little better thanks for all the prayers and the good wishes guys somebody pulled me through I was feeling like crap I did that video and since then I've been feeling progressively better every day so alright just knock this review out real quick I got an order to pick up a true leave and I'm returning this one alright so we got the Blue River Rosslyn cart we got the puck yeah first I want to show us a few things it's not moving that line there's where it was already laying there but we can't believe it you guys can see it's upside down it won't stand up by itself but we'll put it back in this bottle for a second take a couple more puffs for starters when you look online on this on true leaves website it says that this stuff is gonna range between 75 to 85% where is it that mine come out to 41 so I'm half of what they said when you can the reason I was showing you the oil there the if you read on their site and keep reading down it doesn't necessarily say this oil is thin but when you read the description for the battery it says the battery is made for thinner oils so which leads me to believe is this stuff is supposed to be thin I've seen a couple other reviews and theirs was a little thinner see if all that talking it's just barely moved a little bit he's got a little bit more down there from that trickle there so mine was a lot thicker than I think it should have been for starters that might need a little bit of a problem I didn't find I could get a good hit off of this even maybe because it was thicker I'm not sure on that one and my battery's dying of course it is but you I hardly got any smoke I've got it raised up 23.8 when you look at their battery their battery goes from two six two three six so I never went over that it didn't have a burnt taste the taste wasn't bad but this is 60 bucks for a half gram at 40% no way I literally got a better both smoking the joints than I did on that to be honest and you guys know the cartridges should hit take you to the moon real quick I found it to be lacking like I said the flavor wasn't bad if the THC was a little higher it still wouldn't be too bad but still a little pricey but I would recommend these for anybody who doesn't want any kind of leftover residue I mean I know you're not gonna get a lot of leftover residue and there shouldn't be any in there to start with but those who really don't want to take any chance there's this is Sullivan free there's no chemicals used in making this there's no ethanol it's just rosin pressed and then when they're making their THC a there's another by-product it were paying top dollar for bit that way there's no terpenes reintroduced back into it or know that stuff so it's all real so like I said if you don't want any kind of residual ethanol or anything like that this would be a good product for that I know some people that had like mouth cancer or something like that was real skeptical and using anything with any kind of ethanol or anything like that in it so this might be for you I feel I got a bad batch more than likely like I said everybody else's carts seem to be real thin and they moved real quick mine was a lot thicker other than it not hitting good and the effects not being good yes that's what you want something that hits good the effects are good but so for me this one was a big puck no and some of you are gonna go we'll Tim you don't even smoke carts your flower guy when I got my card there was no flower so I've tried all the carts are out there so I do have some knowledge on carts just like a lot of the rest of us out there that have been in a game for a little longer like I said we first got our cards you couldn't get flour you couldn't get shot or crumble know that all as you get was bait carts tinctures in patches I think at the beginning so like I said I've smoked a bunch of cards this one really like I said that 41% I got a better bus smoking a joint that I did take him to four or five hits off of that and four or five hits off of one of these should do you a lot better than a joint ever does so like I said that one for me was a big buck no the reason I'm doing a review real quick if I can return this I got a flower order to pick up a true leave I'm gonna take this bad boy back so I hope everybody's doing good out there if you guys tried one was yours thick like I said everybody else's I seen looked pretty thin like I said the flavors not bad on it I don't know if it's exactly like the rosin because I haven't had puck in the rosin yet indica rosin is a bit hard to come by around here so I've had a lot more of the hybrids and I have the indicas but it has about that taste to it I wouldn't say exactly because I haven't had that one so that's going to be it guys make sure you subscribe like share tell your friends tell your mama until next time keep on poking my friends", "KVFRkBbZ9-E": "everybody how you doing I stopped at the healing center today and picked up some grass roots they got a big drop across roots today and I'm rehydrating a bunch of it now so Cinderella I've got half an ounce of that rehydrating but I've got some East Coast Sour Diesel that's ready to press so please join me as we come over here and show you what we're working with here we got East Coast Sour

ready to go so bear with me here's I move my camera to where you can kind of see everything that's going on okay and then I'll yup Lister when we get ready to press so here here it is CRD mighty prototype press at 200 degrees triple point 20-ton we've got our 8120 micron dug finish and Randy bag inverted ready to give bottom textile impressive casements I'll move this bag up almost set up as a slug here if everybody is doing well during the virus thing here hope everybody staying safe and medicated at home social distancing isn't but at the same time Nina gets medicine so go to the healing center they are keeping everybody at social distance away from each other it's nice and safe but there this morning everybody was nice and orderly it worked out really well just so happened that that drop can get I was the second one in the door today at the Union Center Monroeville so that was pretty cool [Music] these videos today medicine so we pressed into our slug yeah it is cut off the excess and we already have our paper set up you know set this here move the camera in so we get you good view get ready to happen get this sit up here so you get a good view press there we go right there take take our slug and into our press and this paper out of the way as best as possible so you can see what's going on it's more white on the subject here we go you can see what's going on a lot better let's get this centered up Oh the shot closer a little more height on here all right there we go I should look just great [Music] let's make some medicine shall we [Music] they need the pressure hope everybody's fighting themselves enough medication to get through this crisis and please be careful when you shop if you were if you did resort to the black market I just need to warn you a lot of people out there our sum of hot have as Street and it ain't real just let you know so that you don't get burned there are some bad people out there who do not care but you are what your needs are trust me dealt with a lot of with this cannabis space in recent times [Music] okay and should not change clearly long for the start [Music] it's like that here just enough [Music] [Music] I suppose good as this views gonna get more pressure here and it's gonna start extracting real quick [Music] and you can see it in there it's already starting in a little closer [Music] you see it there it is look at that a beautiful a beautiful medicine right there more pressure look at that material move it just wants to come out of that plant [Music] just wants to come out once to medication make your life better I love this plant enough everything that it was to do with this planet but especially precedent that's okay we are approaching the quarterbacks pressure still know the material [Music] get a blowout have an issue here always err on the side of quality over quantity you're not interested in the quality [Music] really not trying to make medicine [Music] almost done good on pressure give us a little bit more time when I stopped seeing any movement see what we got spreading out quite nicely across the face in the plates cuz you're still and rate where it means to me [Music] I think we are about ready look [Music] look at that that beautiful hmm it's like you've got some sand off of this one crystallization all right [Music] right on here let's get the camera we focused what's going on okay so let's see it all right here we go [Music] look at that perfect no contamination of the raw it's exactly what you want to see the smell coming off this is incredible that color got crystals sand [Music] we're just a channel list of a cool now we're gonna gather it up where my trust tool here here we go [Music] look at how nice this is coming up notice the color if you're dealing with hemp you're dealing with hot hemp street that you think as weed doesn't come out looking like this smelling this good you got you got some funk we prefer and I know that with the prices the way they are and I know a lot of people going to the street I'm telling you don't get painted okay be careful I would still recommend going to the dispensary if you want to get results like this on a regular basis the camera here move it around I'll get you focus on there [Music] look at that so let's find out what our yield is showing it's a support let's get you over here get this free centered up right there okay that would be let's find out what our yield is it seems like if I my superiors thought I had put them right here on the table but you know every good so can you see the hello let's get it in here a little bit easier for me to see no I want everybody see what we got here to get this [Music] all right down here", "2iceqqWiVDA": "gyah da word up where I'll be washing this [ __ ] so wheeze legal word figured to make episode 4 why is my light on still all this [ __ ] up here I think I think they took down everything that was like you know buds that you would want to trim up in smoke Ben left everything that's like brett makes some oil out of it so it's looking like to me it's mostly all the ares [ __ ] speaking of that since the CBD oil and plus our CBD products like the different ratios of pills like we've got a we have three to two which is some people call it one point five to one but it's a three to two for instance 60 milligrams CBD 40 milligrams THC which is perfect hunter but it doesn't happen but that would be a three to two and that's like the CBD OG it's actually a two to one flower but it makes it three to two oil like same with canna tonic two to one flower that makes a three to two oil and then we have a ten to one flower that's called XXX and it makes a four to one oil so THC is a little bit more soluble in the butane and propane than their sorry THC is more soluble in it or something or maybe the CBD possibly gets ripped out in the [ __ ] d waxing process who knows but uh no actually because on those runs i don't be waxing to win rise which could pull it out there who [ __ ] knows THC and CBD the molecules are made up of the exact same atoms I believe it's just a different isomer correct me if I'm wrong scientists if I have any watching this but yeah here's some CBD [ __ ] that we got some sharp shock down there more CBD crew [ __ ] and that makes a one two for that shark shock ratio we have so that would be like let's say 80 percent THC twenty percent all right sorry Adi adverse at KFC 20 percent CBD so it's not really mentionable but it does have enough CBD in there to change the effect versus our diesel so yeah that's those so yeah our our four two ones come in ten milligram the ten milligram ones have less than I think it's like two point four two point three milligrams THC and ten milligram CBD the twenty fives have I think six milligrams of THC and twenty-five milligrams of CBD and then the 50s have like 12 milligrams of THC and fifty milligrams of CBD and then of course our three two twos it's like it's 17 milligrams THC twenty-five milligrams CBD we don't make these ones in ten milligram and then the 50s are 35 milligrams CBD or THC sorry 35 milligrams THC and 50 milligrams CBD and init sometimes we even go even further and make a hundred one hundred milligram CBD pill takes a lot of [ __ ] oil that is a lot more valuable in smaller doses because not everyone is trying to get wrecked on CBD oil but some do have high tolerances but for them they could just take 257 so today not really extracting or doing really anything I figured to kind of make it interesting I would show you how I finished the slab kind of like I did in yesterday's video where I had the what wasn't yesterday's video but it was numbers episode three which was on the 21st I think today's a twenty well no that was the 22nd that we did that video I can't find remember I said the dates in the video and you guys see one day they were uploaded so that's the day I might as well grab this [ __ ] in my backpack because I bring it home you should have a [ __ ] another I are done in another heat gun at home that be practical right also our pills we're going to start putting them in these little crack cocaine baggies or whatever versus the mylar ones that we put our oil and sorry about this pump one sec let me go ahead oh my god he must be on the moon or no vice versa he must have a million dollar pump if you follow my Instagram you hear me talk about that [ __ ] with different altitudes and all that how it it's no different as far as what's in there it's the pressure on the outside of the gauge that gives you these faulty readings like that like let's say I was in Denver Colorado no different in there with the same 8 CFM Robin air pump but my needle will probably be right here but it beat the same low pressure out there or in there it's just that work five inches of mercury lower because we're [ __ ] however high your altitude is mile high whatever the [ __ ] that is 4,000 feet or some [ __ ] but yeah people think you can't pull this deep of a vac in Denver as you can down here at sea level just because that needle doesn't go as far people are funny but yeah and just also the the barometric pressure outside today it's higher so that's why that's lower if it was raining like a [ __ ] that [ __ ] would be a little bit closer to 30 and there would still be the same it just has to do with the pressure on the outside of the gauge so no this chamber isn't pulled any [ __ ] deeper than yours if you have this pump I mean different pumps can pull the different capacities but no this isn't at some crazy message mysterious [ __ ] negative 31 HD that's not possible this deeper than absolute vacuum so even even your [ __ ] million dollar NASA pumping so oh I didn't even tell you what I was doing so I'm gonna go ahead and start deflating this so it can that can happen while I'm well I'm telling you what I'm doing here and I can show you what them bubbles do because it's slabs on a higher rap and doesn't have one above it you see them and they don't leave a [ __ ] bubble in them versus if you let that [ __ ] out real quick that's just something I learned maybe this is different for you if it is I mean like if you're doing something that works and you see me stay and do something different don't just do something different if what you're doing works and keep [ __ ] doing it that makes sense right so yeah if it works whatever you're doing works keep doing it then you'll need to change something that's not broken I'm not telling anyone to do that this is Rico who are having issues and answers so uh now what I do I used to cut the same squares of parchment for grams and 1/2 grams but now we do larger squares for the grams than we do for the half grams but they all still go in the same white mylar bags but they're labeled gram or 1/2 gram or whatever you understand so the first thing I have to do since the cutter my dad got me is it wide enough to fit all the parchment the roll why so you have to fold it hot dog style like that remember hot dog and hamburger from kindergarten like that the next step which is that take these [ __ ] and this is just what I do it I'm sure you've been doing it for the longest time I was using the acrylic containers because any time my package is parchment which I'll tell you my mistake on that in a minute but anytime attackers your parchment put in the mylar bags I would do let's say the grams that way and then I quit the half grams and acrylic containers not directly on the acrylic I would use my my little 1 inch circle and heed and hole puncher and I'd punched me a little circle of parchment out to put the oil on in there so it wouldn't be stuck in there but my personal well I put in parchment the way I do it package now the parchment I was using back then was the foil back to parchment so you couldn't really see through it versus now I use this [ __ ] so when I package and I put it in a little container like I'll probably show you that I'll put it in the mylar baggie you can actually still see the color of the oil through it and someone I mentioned that on Instagram so see how it's foil on the back and I would use this also to put this [ __ ] in the bag so you still just see foil you wouldn't see that well so someone come in to buy six grams wouldn't buy six single grams and that they would buy [ __ ] twelve half grams in the acrylic ones because they could see what they were getting so now packaged different in it's a lot cheaper and a lot easier which I used to say I don't need to do the cheap way but whatever [ __ ] I'm doing the cheap way so now what you do with these this is 15 inches wide I know because I measured it so you go like this you have my fifth [ __ ] assistant now and I'm still [ __ ] packaging because they have other jobs too and I'll explain why cuz I'm sure twenty or thirty minute twenty thirty comments oh but you're existent I'll be your assistant I'll explain why I'm when we're out there smoking why you guys gave me my assistant because I make videos I need someone to come help me I'm sure I get fifty people going sure I live in the same state I'm gonna come help you but then you would get paid but the thing is we don't trust you not just me even if I trust you let's say I try to do with my life um I have bosses that have to trust you too and in case you didn't notice anytime a room comes down there's anywhere from a 6000 watt room or a 4000 watt room or 12 thousand watt room worth herb drying which you would be around so in you be around all the oil and all the equipment and starting material starting material so you guys would need a lot of trust so it's not necessarily what you can do and I'm here I am telling you now before we're smoking but it's it's a trust issue so it's it's mainly not how good you are at packaging or how good you are helping me make oil so far I haven't had anyone I mean I'm training they do now they let me make well cause he's a [ __ ] he's got a PhD in microbiology so that really really helps he knows all the [ __ ] smart [ __ ] but the mechanics is actually doing the extraction that's what I he has to learn so back to what I was saying for as far as someone coming in here to do this for me I'm not always gonna be here there's not going to always be someone here babysitting you yes you're on camera but who cares if we got you on camera if you went to [ __ ] Florida with the weed you know what I'm saying so that's the issue with that so pretty much I stick to only people who already employed or I want to employ because it's a what do you call it volunteer situation as far as collective gardens go but I can only work her well how many people do it because just because we already trust him to [ __ ] work in the shop then obviously then we trust him to be out here doing this so now I'm going to five so I didn't mention what I did there but I went to uh I started off with the end of it at the 10 inch mark and I had said left me with five overhanging because remember 15 inches so then after that I went ahead in a cut it and I moved over to can't assume these are backwards I've moved it over to UM [ __ ] I'm so sidetracked and I'm trying to get these papers right so damn it okay so effective missing so I started with it the end of the thing at the tin mark right there sliced off five inches and moved it to five sliced off five more inches and now I have three five inch by five well I guess I underestimated so they're probably five by four and a half and then I'll go yes this is H H mixing wondering you know I need you is get like some of them [ __ ] shave you [ __ ] by me wanting them x-ray table so I can lay my dark ass [ __ ] [ __ ] that should have been food-grade but I needed to make him to shatter because I'm gonna peasant one of those slabs and go and throw that [ __ ] on it on an x-ray [ __ ] table so I can make it look all gold and then be like yeah it's at this shot so all the patients can go there and get [ __ ] disappointed when they find out that it's as black as the [ __ ] they took this morning oh I don't know if that would be healthy so I just fold it in half and now I felt like this and I have all of them I think there's a 15 of them here and so I doing like that right so now they're folded and then you can set them up with my grandma's on the left side and that's just a quick demonstration yes I still use the cheap [ __ ] I don't even know how cheap the scale is you guys would probably tell me but yes I still use I have one at home and I one here and next door they got the nice scale this is what I weigh the weed on it's one of them balanced e ones where's my tear Toph right here boom so just more [ __ ] drying got a frog in my throat this morning guys so yeah that's the half gram size ones it's a gram size one and then I just kind of sit here chipping away now that it's deflated I can go ahead and show you what we're gonna do it is [ __ ] weird to lock oh well just let someone get hurt [ __ ] one arm sucks with the powder-free was there was a nursing assistant we had the powdered gloves and going from a [ __ ] musky ass hand that was just in a glove into a powder glove you don't really have that issue but doing it with these which always use powder free she loves Hannah weed or oil or anything like that because you want to smoke that talk oh speaking of toffee powder I bought a pocket [ __ ] and it came with talking powder put on it and then it keeps the the material feeling more [ __ ] like I guess I don't know but I never used that [ __ ] cuz afraid of getting my peel and burned I don't know if that's exactly appropriate for YouTube I mean Here I am with [ __ ] weed but I'm sure they'll blend but can give me in trouble for talking about [ __ ] pocket [ __ ] so here's the slab on the parchment dah-dah-dah still not looking as pretty as it is and remember those bubbles keep in mind these indentations from where they were because those are gonna open up after we flip it and hit with heat gun and if I flip it and let's say let's just say this was because it's been purging for 48 hours there no sorry 46 hours so let's just pretend that it's only been purging for 12 hours if I flipped it over right now put it back in the oven it would do the exact same thing and it's going to do when I go ahead and hit with the seat gun only I'm not trying to go in there and [ __ ] pull out even more turps after I'm done purging it as you guys saw my mistake last time I didn't have my [ __ ] cut already twenty-fifths I think please it yesterday was his 24th DJ's 20 I delete this is my only black curling shirt I've got four or five green ones I've got at least three blue ones and I got two red ones so pretty much half of my [ __ ] t-shirts or these shirts and then a lot of my other t-shirts are of that real-deal extract [ __ ] when we have those shirts made and then the [ __ ] and ex-partner goes around running around still calling it using my [ __ ] name and my [ __ ] logo so I decided it [ __ ] it I make one for her well healing just call this [ __ ] was going [ __ ] ain't gonna steal that name so yeah so that's why I don't wear the real good x-ray shirts no more unless I'm at home and I just feel like wearing a shirt around the house damn it I [ __ ] up herbal evening shirts too from using them in life like doing extractions to keep at the bottom of a pool of dry ice and they get all ripped up and [ __ ] up I should be using that really likes track shirts for that so remember just like last video before the flip I always do this and you don't have to do one side than the other you could do one side and then a third of it and then the other third of it yeah that works too or you could even do like I get in the last video where you do it over something hell someone's probably going to make some [ __ ] pyramid thing like this to do it over whatever you're going to drop it on the floor whatever you're scared which I've done this with hundreds of slab to still have a droplet on the floor so I mean I've dropped slab but not from that and it sucks from dropping slabs because the only thing you really do from there is dissolved in alcohol and winterize it and then now you've got some winter ice [ __ ] any others does but it was on the floor okay one on the floor isn't gonna die in that alcohol that you're scared of at least and if it's any particulate [ __ ] it's getting filtered out Oh someone's calling me decline so I like about this phone it doesn't ruin my whole video when I need a phone well I do hate like if I'm filming a skate trick or something like that like it was yesterday and someone text messages me and he goes okey-dokey now time for the damn heat gun which I have to remember to turn that [ __ ] down because is using it for decarboxylated in combination with a griddle but I like the heat from the top in the bottom to not waste time and this thing happens to fit perfect in a lab stand like this so you can have it blasting down onto your top of yours in okay so here's what we'll do we'll start right here at the front of your screen where you can see the best maybe we'll turn the light on somebody getting in the regular way I'm out 133 yeah that's fine and I just tested it on the table loaded on the table with I argon to see how it was gonna do I mean if I can put my hand on it then it's not too hot dude this smells real good this is the royal camp and this is actually from the stuff that I made the dry cept with I put all my B grade rice if back in the tube the first run a royal Kim that I did and I still have more to run but the first one that I did was with just straight I'll show ya any second I'll show you after this slab to that whole thing and all this is doing is speeding up what would happen if he tossed it back in the oven and didn't pull it back they just let it sit there for 30 minutes since I'm not trying to wait 30 minutes well it sits in there and then I can forget and come back two hours later and it makes it one CH of [ __ ] turd bubbles what you mean is other volatile [ __ ] that got extracted with the volatile non porous all of it and there's nothing volatile in there other than [ __ ] butane just blue so 16 year old kids mine wait these see this selfie shot you dis [ __ ] I'll do up d1 in the video and I might even post one on Instagram because for some reason though he's tend to get the most [ __ ] lights not that I'm fishing for likes but I mean that just means people enjoy the picture which that's why I'm here to put up [ __ ] people enjoy so now it doesn't look like it did and quickly well it's not completely cool back off I do have to uh to do this with it okay make sure don't have that bond with the parchment because when you do heat up one side it does heat up all the way through yes I just lost the dabs work boohoo sure some tears of a shed you want it to be able to not be sticking so now here's what made the first batch row Kim what I do if you watch the great gardener video where him and him in a bubble man took the bard with the seeded barb and they held it they did one of these numbers they would hold the branch like this and they go so I do that over another tub and then after I've pulled all the branches up I go and run it so that's how that works so now let's go get another pair of gloves it's like you know what [ __ ] it the ones that I originally was using a minute ago go ahead because I didn't touch that nasty wood thing [ __ ] it I'm touching my slab let me get a real pair of gloves not like I'm not gonna be [ __ ] package when I'm packaging or what someone else is packaging that is a glove funeral day you haven't even got to the point where we smoke and it's [ __ ] almost 30 minutes in hope no one's upset say do you know people like to watch the dabs [ __ ] maybe I'll take my little uh slab selfie I'll take the screenshot from this video to use so now that I got this on the next step is to put the hat on backwards so the bell of the Hat doesn't stick to the slab in then third step the fools then I think this makes a difference you put on your lab coat even though this wasn't on for earlier parts of this process you put it on for the picture and people like it don't you know my [ __ ] or not already now this is where it's weird because normally I used the front-facing camera to do this so I don't know if I'm gonna be in the shot so I guess I gotta set my [ __ ] up so usually I'm right here my slabs right there this should work so then I go at my camera on 5 second timer I push ding I got five seconds to and I hold it and then I hear good click and I go like this we get that out for whether it'll stick on it and then I'm already getting hot so I quickly have to go and take off this book in lab coat which makes the whole difference in your process you were on one of these oh my god this [ __ ] PP ends go down tariffs coke [ __ ] prices go up only good things come from wearing a [ __ ] backup plus prejudice people think you're smarter so I think oh one more thing to do get high let's smoke the [ __ ] that we just [ __ ] finished this part looks like it wants to come off keep stuff verse not keep stuff can tell a difference and when I say Keith I don't mean [ __ ] keep the [ __ ] out of it I mean pulling a total of counting the B grade pulling about 35 grams off of 600 grams is over pound and then only taking out of that 35 grams only getting like less than 10 fullmetal then taking that stuff that wasn't full amount putting it back in the tube with the weed I mean it's not like I run this train over and over to know the difference in yield but it [ __ ] stinks damn cop coffee filters make it too good Deborah why am I wearing gloves one gabbing okay I gave a little bit of oil to a friend who just like smokes whether they're blunt smoker and they just got a lead pipe they don't have any way to dab anything like that so I gave them some oil and said the clear on top you got that beer weed I get text messages last night it's making my weed light on fire like yeah let that [ __ ] melt into the bud first then you just get like 30 more extra hits off the bud than you normally would have he's my we get some fire oh man I remember back in uh when this [ __ ] was new before there was lab testing and a lot of logic used and there was a lot just dumb [ __ ] where people was like look if it makes butane come from the sky and land back into your already first oil and dumb stupid [ __ ] like that and there was people just I mentioned earlier I said people think the only volatile thing that's in that mixture of 400 different [ __ ] compounds or more they think the only volatile thing there is a butane when all the Terps are [ __ ] aromatic hydrocarbons which are [ __ ] flammable so there's so much [ __ ] that is you know ignite that we do extract from weed yeah my favorite thing about these ceramic nails is that you get them [ __ ] your hit is the same every time we get them brand [ __ ] new every dev you get a brand new and [ __ ] and it's not like an unseasoned taste I mean it's not we're not dabbing on titanium so you're not gonna get that but ceramic I mean you do get a burnt down case if your dad too hot like if I'd out in the next book in 30 or 40 seconds I'm not going to be enjoying it to him yeah I was watching those Mexican kids down in Texas the skate will get a major crew I found I mean I think it was when Josh Katz I did a shout out I was when I found him or maybe it was the foot no it was that Hannah Montana skating video when the Halloween last year one got popular there nice [ __ ] rip that that inspired me to get on a skateboard yesterday and hurt myself smashed my balls a couple times so that was fun yeah but I think we're good Cheers that's one [ __ ] that yeah I brought home some the first lab I'm bringing that back that woman is the [ __ ] who had to take a walk for that speaking of my smartass assistant this is still here people were clipping I think and snow had something to do with it nope snow cap was in this bag like a [ __ ] here ago oh you'd like cuz he knows I know that hydrocarbons is like the main structures that I [ __ ] enough so he drew a propane molecule right there just stick show me how why it's nonpolar you mean why different [ __ ] tonight and I pretty much already forgot most of the [ __ ] they showed me but he kept trying all these different [ __ ] molecules like water I mean like Gaddy that's totally Mickey Mouse [ __ ] water molecule second came out pretty tomato hydrochloric acid and then he made um acetic acid which was I think in vinegar or is vinegar some [ __ ] like that and then he made I think not methane but there's something he made something so that was cool give me one laughs look at that selfie slab no you saw how I pull the slab out of the oven looking probably like most Year guys at slabs and I flipped it over one last time and did that and now it looks like this so that's how you do it in case you were wondering I'm gonna get the packaging now so I hope you guys enjoyed this video peace", "zVQruAIpxWk": "[Music] welcome to wheat entertainment and we love talking about grandy flora strains and this bud is something called yada da and it's really a unique looking bud but it was crunchy dry when i got it i opened up this bag and then i set it down and now it's even drier because i think i got this thing i don't know three weeks ago a month ago it just sat in the back i don't know why i didn't review it but i didn't do it so today's the day for yada da and let me load my little scooper into vapor cup straw i've already got two in here we're gonna add the third then we're gonna tamper and we're going to stick this down in the vapor cup then we're going to talk about yadda da yada comes in this bag and i got this at cookies maywood i got this at the apples and bananas drop down there i ran down there they held that for me and there were some comments on wheat entertainment so i grabbed it when i was down there and this flower has 26 thc and people are asking for the package date and uh so i'm going to give it that but to get that date i need a magnifying glass because my eyes aren't so good anymore so this is the package manufactured it is 9 29 20. oh no wonder it's so dry it's been in this bag for months right and you know what's crazy you would think that they're saving money on the jars right so at least they would give us some kind of moisture pack in here so these flowers when they come out of this bag are more fresh so let's say i got this the beginning january was harvested three months before crazy just crazy but anyway it's not about the dryness i don't wait for that so even though i note it that has nothing to do with my ratings my ratings are all about the something something and everyone's got their own something something that they're looking for but what i'm looking for are heavy flowers with focus that could grin me out i have to stay active i have a lot of responsibilities have to take care of i need flowers that can let me do that now i'm also a heavy hitter so a lot of the flowers even though i call them focus flowers they could stone you to the bone but it doesn't necessarily do that for me but certain ones do like the couch lock flowers but this isn't about catch lock i'm not looking for those type of flies this is about focused flowers that can grin me out so today it's jan dada turn to get the review we're looking for the best well let's check it out so you can see that's about amount a time it takes for vapor cup to work you can see that right there that's the terpenes the cannabinoids the water vapor and the oil vapor you can see it condenses right on the straw it takes about a minute and 20 once this cup is hot and also a lot of people have vapor cup so make sure your cup is hot if the cup is hot you need less time in the chamber if it's a fresh you just start it up you're going to need more time in the chamber and that's one of the things when you get vapor cup you got to learn use but i love this thing this thing changed my life but today it's about yada da so let's check it out yada da by grandiflora at 330 degrees out of vapor cup let's do this again so this flower's got a light og taste with a pungent pal but there's much bigger pungent pals than this one but it has it and the pungent pal it's i'm gonna say it's something like the chicken wing you know when you go buy chicken wings you smell it it makes you kind of like the ammonia taste people say ammonia but if you try vapor cup i'm going to tell you it's a pungent pal this flower took me a lot of flour to get stoned actually but it definitely got me stoned this flower's strong enough but not super strong and i thought it was good so what did i rate yada da i'm looking for the best and this flower you know at first i'm saying it's not strong enough but i used a really lot of it i used up half an eighth on the session i mean i really used a lot of it and in the end the feeling was actually kind of good it wasn't heavy it wasn't you had focus or didn't have focus i would say it was like a cruiser a little bit i wish it personally would have been a little heavier this flower gets an 8.65 which means it's a good flower if you're not a super heavyweight yeah it's a try but for someone who's a super heavyweight this flower may be not strong enough for them it was good but there's definitely better out of granny flora if you want to get a vapor cup this item right here and i'm telling you instead of smoking your flour up and joints get one of these things that little bit of flour that i put into this cup can last you 10 minutes and stone you to the bone i love this thing makes so many opportunities for use i love it and you can see it at vaporcup.com if you want to see my favorite picks you can see them on wheat entertainment.com that site's just getting updated right now it's going to have my top 100 strains in la out of 1500 strains i tried this is my journey i'm looking for the best thanks for joining in if you have a tip for me leave it below the video i'm the doctor i post every day but sunday it's my day off party on my friends [Music] you", "dTETBUOM_Gg":

no air compressor required ultra accurate force measuring load cell which displays bag pressure in real time that's a market first for manual rosin press super responsive pressure control that allows for as little as 10 pound force increments press up to 12 grams of flowers or 20 grams of kefir hash at a time with ease features our press wear technology which offers a full-color LCD touchscreen with custom software for even more control you can save up to 29 preset recipes so once you dial in your settings you can repeat your results over and over and over again up to five tons of force which is ten thousand pounds of force output from our hundred percent custom engineered lead screw twist press technology these guys have put a lot of time and energy so trust me when I say these guys understand engineering and they really produce their rosin presses from an engineer's perspective that's how the machine is getting built even heat distribution from zero Fahrenheit to 300 Fahrenheit from our in-house machined aluminum plates each with its own thermocouple which is great temperature accuracy to less than one degree Fahrenheit ultra durable powder coated construction and of course their patent pending so I say we get started right away it was just such a pleasure when my long Peaks showed up I loved the way they shipped it I loved everything about how they packaged it it was just really quite a pleasure to open that package and I kind of have a feeling this one's not gonna be too too different crack off this lid see see what's inside just a little bit of papers so you've got your invoice got your invoice right there you've got rosin bag filters which is quite nice I'll take a photo of it and put it up on the screen so you can see about their press moulds they're specialized scraping tools you know the funnel kit the quick flip the bag sizes the screen sizes all of these different things are pretty pretty important to kind of know where you sit how rosin is pressed they have a really nice little folder which I will also photograph and put up on the screen so you can look at that and see the different screen sizes and from flower to Keith to bubble hash and the different tips for the different things and the consistencies and the textures these guys have really been doing a great job I gotta say working with them has an absolute pleasure so they also have a little card in there for the harvest rate pharmaceutical freeze dryer all right look at that here's the top right there be careful with our knife so it's gonna be somewhat careful when you're using a knife especially when you're opening a package that you don't know exactly how it's been shipped all right so these look like the little feet put those down over here there's four of them so that makes sense all right what else we got here yes this is the beat of the press I've seen these enough times to know these go on the side of the machine with the feet that screw into them so that should be easy enough to do while we're on the unboxing video let's just screw these right into here we'll go as much as we can I'm not sure how much we should leave but probably probably a little bit one two three four threads one two three four threads one two three four threads perfect that's the right height get the other one in here what I love about peer pressure is just the quality of the craftsmanship you know the idea that this came from a real engineering standpoint and they put a lot of thought into into putting this this unit together it is definitely not something that is fly by the pants seat of your pants construction they really do an incredible job I might actually cut this whole box away rather than try to lift out the press I think that is what I'm gonna do yeah we're gonna give you a little show on what's going on in here not sure exactly what all these components are because I've never seen this unit before so you're seeing it really for the first time with me here not sure which these guys are for oh yeah this is our little handle yeah that that little guy right there for cranking it on the top of the unit I like it I like it a lot and on to this one right here it's definitely not as heavy as I thought it might meet which is really nice this definitely goes down right on top boom just like that your handle gets inserted and then okay so the screws are actually right in the unit which is great I can take this off I like how easy this goes on and off and it doesn't seem to need to be locked in place which is very nice okay so I suspect these are gonna go like that there you can also put this unit like this so you can actually have it like this setup where it's sort of horizontal versus vertical so both options are there all right so I already got the one leg on what are the things with these guys that I make a bit of a mistake is they'll have a tiny little bend on their foot and naturally I'll think that the feet go to the outside this is actually the opposite of how it goes you can see the feet go in the unit builds up and there's three little allen keys right here in the side but are fairly easy to unscrew I could be using a drill in making easier but i'm using an allen key so be it and so i love the way the screws just come in in place in the machine you don't have to look for a little bag and try and find the screws it's quite easy you just go to where you're going to be screwing them in and they're already there so it's just a matter of removing them and then screwing them in to secure the feet and I guess that's done because the feet can go on a variety of ways the way they've got it set up you can put it vertical or horizontal so all right just get this up here threading is just really done well it's not gonna be problematic where your screws aren't aren't screwing in nicely or the going in sideways everything just lines up really really well on these units and I appreciate that about about them okay there we go little make sure they're tight on both sides yep yep yep boom look at that there it is right there it comes with a power cord got the same great digital screen and really left the little screen I like the look of this little unit I'm pretty excited about it alright so I figured we should do a little press I've got a little bit of canvas here it sounds like we can press a solid 12 grams of flour at a time on this little unit so we're gonna take the little flip tool that they have I've got the screen over top here this is a hundred and fifteen micron screen we're just gonna flip it inside out that's gonna get that seam on the inside for us and it will hold a lot less oil as you know contaminants capturing oil that we really would rather have release I've got my little funnel I'm going to put on my gloves so we've got our little bag we've got our little 12 grams of herb I am of course pressing my all-time favorite where is my bike just such a great flower to press as it truly really releases an incredible amount of resin so we'll go into there nice I've gone off about these tools before but I might as well a little bit again I just love the ease with which these tools operates I've got quite a bit of extra room it's definitely not going all the way to the top I'll have a nice little bit of screen I'll just be able to fold over I brought my pure pressure template here for pre pressing the pre press get that in there much better over there so we've got a nice flattened piece here this is the older one that I took from and then we have some papers so they sent me once again with some screens all sorts of varieties of screens here which I was very happy I'll be doing some experimenting including stainless steel screens right there send me some stickers which I will be giving away to some folks all right so oh man oh they even sent me a new see that so let's get this opened up and access some of this paper I wondered why this paper was a little smaller than the parchment that I'm used to but I get it makes very good sense in the sense that we're using a much smaller press so too will we be using much smaller paper so I think first things first because we're not ready to press yet let's hit the switch on this little boy this bad boy will see the screen line up probably come over to the side here a little bit and you turn it okay please remove force from press then press okay all right let's remove force from press okay ah there we go so it opens up the same old LED screen that I'm used to and know and love it's giving me my force it's got system settings it's got recipes it's got a quick press it's got run recipe it's about last run data so I say we go into recipes I have merely turned the heaters on here and here I've got my settings at 220 Fahrenheit which for the you know recipe that we're gonna be running is gonna work fine for me let's go back to home let's go back to recipes and let's go back to this one so this one edit recipe name set material type well restarted it again that's interesting well let's you know what let's do it so we'll go select flour select bag size okay so it's adding that the weight based on bag side it's got the temperatures it's got my pressures alright so I'll just go run and then I have to push start press when we're actually ready to do this and I'll be turning this little guy to to check out how how well it works so very very cool little unit these guys do such a great job it's got a little drip tray for those of you that didn't know what this was it's loose weight now was playing around with it now I'm gonna hold the camera but I love the idea of a drip tray I have to admit there we go because these sides I've had parchment absolutely drip down inside the machine on my long Peaks so this is a very nice little unit right here this little drip tray it comes in and out very easy you can lift it right out if you don't want to use it and it's just a matter of actually opening up the press a little bit which happens very easy with a little bit of twisting and this just pops right out so that's our little tray right there I also found out that these particular guys are obviously clamps and what they are for is to clamp the unit down to any table that you're working on if need be if you're really cranking away at this thing so I'm going to use the drip tray you can put it down over this way because that's where the wiring is I'll fit that a nice and carefully there you go perfect alright so we'll wait for these to heat up it's already at 105 degrees potentially oh look at that it even came with magnets these guys are on the ball you can keep that on it's quite a bit of parchment coming off the back which is never a problem for me because I love when I have a real squisher to be able to have that little bit of back room for the oil to escape into so very excited 12 gram runs obviously this is a lot smaller than I'm used to doing I'm used to doing 35 to 40 gram runs a flower and even high - but who knows this is like a real nice little small unit I can carry it around with me and I suspect I could get this thing to fit into a pelican case which means adventures in rosin making how fun would it be to take the bubble bags and the dry set of screens and the rosin press up to the ice cave on the parrots and ice caps and bust out some high quality and that is what's up so we are at a hundred and thirty nine degrees Fahrenheit not too bad both sixty to eighty degrees away from the temperature that we're looking at and as you can see there are important components to getting this you know to making this easy to making it you know less difficult and difficult and that's about having all of the proper tools make sure you have your bags okay what do I have the bags I have some 90 microns I have some 36 microns I have some 72 microns and I have some hundred and fifteen microns so for different sized bags most of these bearings are used for flour 36 micronized use for hash we've got the template for pressing we've got our funnels which I can put the dirty ones in here as well as our flipper unit which is very key and then we've got our our bags our parchment paper so that's also very important just kind of getting all this stuff out of here that's pretty cool the way you can the way you can you know basically attach these two to a table and it's it's not very difficult to do is it you're just gonna try maybe one while we're sitting here tables not queue wide but definitely wide enough that it's there's that one other one of those little doctors not sure this so that's actually a really good idea I'm sure once you get you know moving on this thing you could get a little excited depending on who you are you could start moving the whole unit and that's not really gonna be an ideal situation so when the screen gets put in properly and doesn't doesn't come out because then we end up with with a fair bit of screen contaminant and a plate nice to be able to put my finger in there or not worry about the whole press squishing it and crushing it that's very nice okay so let's go start press stage one yeah so we're at 729 pounds we're at a thousand 1,100 forces at 2,800 okay forces at 4600 let's see if we can turn a little bit and I can start seeing the oil coming out now I can see quite a bit of oil coming up the sides here is buttering up nicely here and it's that it's that some good force right little close up what we got going on here there we go without our percentage we got 8,000 pounds of force I like the drip tray I do indeed like the drip tray and you can also see around back here that it's also starting to push rosin up through the back and it looks like it's wanting to butter up right away and that generally is what happens with very high THC product it was only 12 grams so I'm hoping for at least 3 grams of rosin that would be maybe even a little bit more for this particular strain cultivar cycle complete let's stop the press and we'll open this up it really only gets a little bit tough at the end alright let's go around and see what we got here [Music] here we go for our yield so I'm gonna collect that up and I'll let you guys know what it is in one second here pretty exciting alright so I have crushed out the first and second press I did end up getting just over 3 grams which I guess would probably be around 26% 27% so I left up a little bit behind from what I normally get with my long Peaks keep in mind this is my first press with this unit I didn't really understand exactly how to set it up so I'm pretty sure in the next week or two I'll get that 2% back certainly not upset with it that's for sure three solid grams really caramel beautiful where's my bike flour rosin I gotta say so far the first experience with the helix Pro has been really cool I did also figure out both of these how they actually go on as they go between the wheel and the foot so they go kind of like that underneath and so that's why they don't need to be different sides they both work perfectly and I will set it up next time better with the with the clamps because once you get it listen the first when you're closing it and opening it opens really easy as you get to around 5 6,000 7,000 8,000 pounds per pressure it starts getting a little bit harder and I can see for sure how you could move the whole press so I'm going to thank you all for tuning in you're gonna see a lot more happening with this press we're gonna do a whole video and actually using this press with flour dry sift and bubble hash I just really wanted to do an unboxing video today and I thought what a great way to do an unboxing video to also show a really quick press so thank you to the people the the group over at peer pressure the team if you will I look forward to seeing you all at lyft in January January 11th to 13th or 14th I believe here in Vancouver these guys peer pressure coming out and we'll have a booth you could probably find me at their booth otherwise I would be walking around with my team from embark if you see me there definitely pull me aside and say hello and great great little unit super quality I mean once you see this unit in person and you feel the quality of the tools you really get the idea very quickly this is a solid unit so thanks a lot peer pressure thanks everyone for watching and we'll see you next time on [Music]", "mznjhrZJ5QU": "hey everybody how's it going today had a friend of mine come over with some flour from rise up in monroeville okay we're going to be pressing 10.5 grams of gg4 from gti rhythm okay this stuff is ringing in at 23 thc thca we're going to press it at 180 degrees through 120 micron nut smasher branded bag on my 30 ton crd drip tech rosin press big shout out to crd and i want to give a big shout out to my other uh collaborators and sponsors from operation 1620 to balanced veterans to happy hippie trips vapor galleria you folks have all been fantastic i want to show you this flower i'm going to bring it up to the camera here let you get a nice view of it look at how beautiful that is huh look at that just gorgeous super super crystally okay we're gonna load this up hope everybody is staying safe staying medicated and being good to each other out there hope you're staying warm it is cold as hell out there i don't know where you're at but in pittsburgh it's ridiculous right now uh we're supposed to be getting some worse weather coming up i think tomorrow i think we got another storm front coming in tomorrow so if you haven't gotten to the dispensary yet oh my god look how look at the nice the size of these buds look at this this is not the popcorn we've been used to seeing from a lot of dispensaries lately uh now granted they sometimes sell it cheaper but you know what nothing presses as well as these nice juicy buds they've been rehydrated with hydra stones for two hours so they are ready to go um the smell of this stuff is absolutely intoxicated just by itself uh gg4 is a strain everybody seems to know and love i don't know too many people that have told me hey man i really hate gg4 so this is gonna be fun to press oh okay let's get this nice and put in here make sure you can kind of see what's going on all right we're going to cut the excess off the bag grab some parchment [Music] oh yeah super it might be it might be i did find out with this newer press that you really have to [Music] uh have to put a lot of layers in here because this stuff will seep through at the kind of tonnage you're putting on it now it's got to make kind of a directional pouch here to make sure everything stays inside where you want it to be all right get this in here fold up our bag and put it in the middle of our little pouch right here that summer's right there thing is it isn't going to look real pretty on video because when these plates really close down we're going to lose everything on the video but wait do you see what it looks like when it comes apart again it should be super cool i'm going to move the camera a little bit i'll stay stay where you are give you guys a real good view of what's going on here has some happy trees here in a minute all right bring it right up here [Music] turning green to gold that's what we do here at astr's finest closed not available okay here we go and we're bringing the hammer down see what this stuff does so might be able to get us a little better view here here we go [Music] let's get this camera adjusted here for you a little tighter [Music] there we go [Music] i like that heat soaked in there as i bring up that pressure gently i'm looking for that seepage to start really quick because this is a really nice strain a lot of people are pressed gg4 pressing this at last time i pressed gg4 i pressed it at 200. let's see what it does this time i think it's gonna be [Music] beautiful oh yeah out of love gotta love that smell okay okay relax everything [Music] i like using the phone as a monitor because i can get it real closely until i hit a certain point this is right around the point where you're gonna stop seeing a lot of stuff on the video watch this [Music] just keep bringing the pressure nice and slow and nothing will start to move oh god yeah let's see anything [Music] so [Music] so here that is the sweet spot this might not be the most exciting part of this video but you're really going to love what you see coming off of this thing in a minute i can guarantee you that sure all right big shout out to my friends over at rise of monroeville my family up there hope you guys see this video this is the fire that was purchased at your dispensary today check it out we're gonna open this up here in about 30 more seconds and we're going to see what she's doing oh come on show me what i want to see show me that gold [Music] show [Music] okay oh [Music] what happened all right i'm gonna pull this camera out like ouch back over here all right like opening up a present on christmas day look at that isn't that beautiful [Music] oh look at that looks beautiful yeah it's a happy plant there was no overpressure no blowout came out perfect nice and different so if you want to see it okay do this in two stages i'm gonna grab a slick and deposit it all on here so i can squish it out and show everybody how pretty it is and then we'll put it into a jar we'll weigh it up for you to see what the yield is good nice brand new slick [Music] and make sure there's no cap air which is a hazard in this place all right skip tool my brand of choice when it comes to this type of thing i really like the way they work okay here we go oh look at that look at that consistency so glad i did this at 180. at 200 i think this is shattered up i really do oh [Music] beautiful day this fills the room that beautiful stuff yes sir high quality thc tell me you seen the water boy oh yeah [Music] [Music] just [Music] dude colors color is awesome color is completely what you want to be seeing that beautiful pastel [Music] well you're dealing with a variable plant you know it's different every every batch is a little different every pheno is definitely different you know so you can automate things to a certain degree but it still really takes somebody who knows what they're doing watching what's going on you know if i dress that stuff on there another minute and a half it would have probably shattered up you know that's what i mean it's just a matter of doing it doing it doing it until you kind of do it by instinct on this you know i i don't really like using gauges and stuff like that but uh do you find that maybe indicators produce a little more than sativa they do they do they do yeah as a general rule now the exception to that rule african tie i knew it and and malawi memory loss also for the crime those those are two straight indica or straight sativas that produce and behave like indicas on a press i've never seen anything else like um banana kush from from rhythm is another one that's really really nice and oppressed brownie scalp birthday cake great divide all of those excellent yeah you should check out my database i got a link to it that you know you can it changes as i add new data like when i add this it'll update right now so everybody who has a link can view it you can't change anything on it you can look at it it's only like my fifth dispensary flower press this year well the thing is dude you bring what you need for you you know this is about you i mean i love making it for you but this is about what strain works for you right i think i'm a little snobbish when it comes to me only because this is what i do all the time i don't try to press a lot of stuff under 25 percent for me but for patients hey that's your medicine man i'm going to try to get you the very best of what it will give but when you get below you know 25 the yields start to drop significantly so but this this is really really nice just came up very very nice and here missina is not happy to be excluded from the festivities she is a she wants that hey she wants what she wants when she wants it and that's just how it is with the caliper no she does she's she likes she likes to smelly sticks her nose in my raws and every time every time she gets the chance she gets man oh absolutely well here's the other thing too okay you know look i know you're not supposed to smoke it but most people who who who do flower they they smoke right so you take an eighth home that you just spent 65 bucks on or 60 and you're gonna get if you're lucky three joints or maybe two once out of that eighth okay that to me is half a day's worth of medication at most at most you take that same eight you press it the rosin press and get anywhere near a grammar rosin from it and grandma rosin medicates me to the same level three solid days that's why i do this because you save money and get better medicine because this is nug run not trim this is solventless in its purest form right off right off the plant right into rosin no intermediate work needs to be done single stage to medicine so let's get this kind of gathered up okay i'm gonna try to get this all together there we go now it's gripping oh it's broken now there this is mighty fine medicine okay what i'm gonna do is backlight it so you can really see how nice this really is look at that look how clean that is that is beautiful gg4 gti let's find out what our yield is now shall we because that's what a lot of people are waiting to see what did we get so started off 10.5 let's see what 10.5 turned into okay zeroed out get her in the jar oh 1.573 i'll take it any day thanks for joining me for this video stay safe stay medicated and be good to each other asher's finest on the case", "gBxDK8RyU-4": "what's going on y'all supreme reviews here coming back at you with another episode of dab talk a series we review cannabis concentrates in six different categories value packaging looks smell taste and effect we then take these six categories write them on a one through five scale add them up divide them by six which gives us our final score today we're going to be reviewing um a brand new to me brand called seattle private reserve they're decently popular they've been around for a while but i've never tried their wax before so i'm excited to try it so seattle private reserve this company has an interesting sort of history as far as i know so uh back in the day when my friends and i used well my friends would cop it and i'd go to their house and smoke it um their seattle private reserve flower i noticed just wasn't up to snuff they were charging a lot for it and every time we got it it just never seemed you know up to par with how much they were charging but as far as i wax goes i am uninformed i have no idea so i'm excited to see if their wax is different and i'm hoping that it is different because i've seen pictures of it on instagram looks quite appetizing so yeah without further ado we're going to get right into it here value so starting off with value this gram uh costed forty dollars so not too bad um at forty dollars a gram it's not cheap at all but for this type of quality at least from what i can see it looks really high quality so from this type of quality uh forty dollars is not not terrible at all um because you can pay anywhere from i'd say low of 35 all the way up to even 60 dollars per gram for something like this um so yeah i i think the value is pretty it's it's okay it's at 40 it's kind of expensive but you're not going to be breaking the bank for it moving on to the packaging here really really like this packaging so you guys can see here they got the strain name on top source cake and then got all this information here on the side all the stats all the terpene percentage everything like that and it's all in one glass jar no cardboard no plastic no extra added waste to this product really really happy about that i love this kind of packaging y'all i think the last video that had this kind of packaging got a super high packaging rating so yeah i love this kind of packaging so now for the open test here so i think you just grab it and twist or okay hold on so if you guys see these stickers right here you are probably it's your best bet to cut them so i'm grabbing myself a tool here your best bet to slice through them with something so that you can then turn it because using the torque to turn it like the torque from your wrist is probably not going to work so right now i'm going to use this tool cut a little bit of it so i guess that's my least favorite part of the packaging so like really my only part that i don't like is that you got to kind of do a little bit of finagling to get it open but once you do that you're going to get to the goodies it's because they have two like plastic stickers there's one cardboard sticker that one's not a problem at all but they got these plastic stickers make it almost impossible wow okay this is actually a lot harder than i thought not gonna lie right i think i got it okay this is actually annoying to open i'm not even gonna lie like what what is going on here what am i not doing right can't open it dude okay this is i can't open this this is ridiculous what the [ __ ] okay sweaty hands all right so this packaging sucks i can't even [ __ ] open it this is ridiculous this packaging sucks ass dude this packaging is terrible what the heck i can't okay well i can't even like what is this i can't i'm getting so upset right now i mean what is this going to take dude for me to open god damn man like [ __ ] really still not [ __ ] opening on me all right [ __ ] all right i think i almost got it okay this almost i'm so sorry y'all but for this delay but this is this is ridiculous this might be the worst packaging i've had on the channel so far okay got this [ __ ] open holy crap okay that took how long that took like okay that took like four minutes to open i'm so sorry about that y'all but i figured you needed to see it real time [ __ ] this packaging no like [ __ ] it i thought it was good this sucks ass like what is wrong with this lid there's a bunch of like plastic [ __ ] here there's like plastic notches that you gotta like push it down and [ __ ] dude that's impossible to open this packaging is terrible this just fix these notches man i just spent five minutes opening that that's ridiculous okay deep breath calm down okay we're good i'm sure there's a couple funny ass faces i made during that i'm not gonna lie because i was getting i was starting to get pissed i was like i was wondering am i gonna get this gram open for the video or am i gonna have to stop the video but that was by far the hardest gram to open on the channel so yeah that's annoying moving on to the looks well these they look really good this looks really good it's got a really kind of a moist live resiny look to it crystal crystalline it looks really good it looks really kind of battery like it's all going to come up in one scoop which is nice you know i hate that little crumble consistency where you pick one up and it goes everywhere that shit's annoying but um but yeah i like this the looks of this one a lot moving on to the smell here okay that smells bomb it smells like so sour you see sour kush cake was it yeah sour kush cake you're definitely getting some of that wedding cake profile for sure pretty you can smell like it kind of smells sour this is really good it's got a pungent smell to it i like the smell a lot for sure pungent sour wet and cakey really nice moving on to my favorite part of the video and a much needed part of the video considering the beginning took me five minutes to open the taste i need a fat dab right now that was ridiculous y'all that that was ridiculous i literally had to grab this screwdriver and like do some really weird crap to get this open but i did it i got it open so here's a present to myself for getting this gram open cheers huh all right whoa that did it okay um it tastes really good i'm not even gonna put the lid back on i'm just going to like set it on top let's [ __ ] that but it tastes really good it's got kind of a the same kind of sour wedding cakey taste that it was smelling like there i really like that really strong really really clean all the way throughout really really nice uh taste on this product on to the effect here sorry y'all dying a little bit over here moving on to the effect so i like this this effect now that i've been sitting here for a couple seconds it's a nice it's a nice hybrid like i said about the uh i'm pretty sure it was the runts i feel like i can either work out right now which i just did or i can relax and play with like play with my dogs or watch something or whatever it is that you do when you like to relax you can do that after this train it's a nice nice evenly even keel uh sort of hybrid i really like the effect on this one i like the the older i get the more i like the hybrids um moving on to the ratings portion of the video now so for value okay so at forty dollars a gram you're getting a really good quality concentrate you really are the only problem i have with it is it's incredibly hard to open so like if they fix the packaging on this one the value would be a little like higher but the fact that you're paying forty dollars a gram to spend like five minutes struggling to open it with a screwdriver that's that's annoying that's that's ridiculous so i'm gonna i'm gonna say for that the value gets a 2.5 out of five because the concentrate was really good just fix the packaging because that was enough to like almost that almost made me quit filming because i i was like dude am i going to sit here for 10 minutes because that was long enough i mean that was ridiculously long the amount of time i sat there tried to open that so i was just i had to i had to open it and luckily i got it open but yeah it's terrible 2.5 out of 5 for the value packaging okay packaging one out of five i'm literally giving that a one out of five because that that is so annoying like you guys i'm sure you guys saw i was getting like legitimately mad at that freaking container like that's ridiculous so one out of five in the packaging no wii container should make you angry none that's ridiculous moving on to the looks so really like the looks on this one it's got kind of a orangish sort of tint to it it's nice um you guys will see the high resolution photo of course but really like the looks on this one i'm gonna go ahead and give the looks a four out of five because those are really good really prime looks moving on to the smell uh that smells awesome uh it smelled really really good it smelled like uh like i said kind of a sour wedding cake profile so really good i'm going to go ahead and give the smell 3.5 out of 5. moving on to the taste the taste was just like it smelled really like the exact same sour wedding cakey taste i really like that as well giving that a 3.5 out of 5. moving on to the effect so i really like this effect definitely took me down a few notches after getting upset over that whole thing but yeah i'm liking this effect a lot it's really really really nice um [Music] yeah it's like like i said it's like a 50 50 hybrid so you're getting that sativa sort of pick me up um sun's out guns out sort of thing you know if you want to go lift some weights and you're getting that relaxation body high feeling if you want to relax and not really do much after working out or working or whatever it is you do so uh yeah i'm really a fan of this effect a lot it's one of my favorite ones on the channel so far so i'm going to give it a 3.5 out of 5 as well so yeah for that that gives us 18 divided by 6 equals 3 out of 5. that might have been one of the first even numbers we've had on this channel as far as the writing goes but yeah three out of five would i buy this again man okay so like i really like the really like everything about this the packaging i mean now that i know how to open it i'll probably buy it again but that's the the way this is the way this packaging is i don't know man they really got to fix it that was so upsetting so would i buy it again probably i don't know i think there's better options out there for 35 to 40 but if they put this wax in like an abstract container absolutely i would buy it again hope you guys are enjoying my content uh hope you guys enjoyed my little mini freak out earlier in this video i'm sure it was mildly entertaining or boring either way yeah please like and subscribe if you like this channel um i know i get kind of repetitive with the content so far but i plan on branching out soon i just don't have enough resources yet to really fully branch out like i would like to so really enjoying the support y'all peace out", "fsGg64R-ILw": "all right how's everybody doing this job let's ENC connoisseur so you got a good one for today I got promise earlier next time I went out on Good Sam day I do a receipt video for you guys well I'm in my shop right now on my pool table here and I'm gonna lay it out for you let me get a box all right first things first here's the receipt what I got here is one two three four five six seven grams of oil for a hundred and eleven dollars I'll show you I'll show you here in a minute so we got this is pink starfighter from mother earth farms and I'll do a up although it close up of all these I got four grams of that that is a Terp sugar it is a very crystalline nice consistency Terp sugar wax crystal whatever I got some this is actual opal sugar live resin original glue it's gorilla glue but the company suitum so they had to make it original glue one gram right there this right here Tesla tower from URLs lazy bee farms they make some amazing stuff really beautiful color oh I should get another close up for this here in a minute and this right here some dab X gelato this is distillate running 91.3% and I'll set this over there and I'll come around you guys close up real quick all right Wayne there's [ __ ] down like this right here what lose him like this right here [Music] sorry about the air compressor guys like I said I leave my shop all right so first things first you got the receipt here we'll go with what's first well first on the list here top of the list we're looking at nature's gifts retailers of fine cannabis we've got - track original glue opal sugar 1 gram which is a hybrid tax included 28 dollars and 49 cents so that's this right here live resin is an a.1 dope cup award winner there's a hybrid is live resin opal sugar premium extracts now you got your original glue live resin opal sugar total cannabinoids of 8730 THC is 76 - all right there you go what's next on here we got dab X gelato distillate that's a hybrid one gram tax included twenty two dollars and seven cents well here's that dab X [ __ ] look at the color on that [ __ ] oh it's just beautiful I mean it's it's it's beautiful look at some of the old stats here oh well turn this thing right side up here so we got THC a zero THC standard steady 4.5 cbdo CBD a CBD it's looking like total cannabinoids in 91.3 I don't know how they get to that with a THC of 74 point five but I just smoke it and this stuff is amazing great flavor great flavor okay next on the old list here what do we got what do we got we got damage we Earl's lazy be Tesla tower as a sativa one gram is 2849 with tax included alright and that is 100% to the wrong price and I'm gonna have to go back and check that because I'm pretty sure this was supposed to be $18.00 we're at THC 65 th CA is 71 total of 76 14% terpenes which is why this stuff tastes so good I'll tell you right now it's looking like that is the most expensive thing other than the Opel sugar and that should have only been $18 but that's okay I'll take it back now we got pink Starfighter right here and then if I you let me open this one up these are all sealed up I just got them back from the store and you see that it looks kind of gooey mom see it's not gooey at all it's a crystalline it was a really nice very very very nice consistency not gooey not sticky really really nice really nice and I sat pink starfighter we got the pink Starfighter Mother Earth farms wax one gram like I said this is pink Terp sugar sugar wax turf sugar wax we're gonna THC 74% total THC is over here we're looking at 74 point for beauty beauty beauty and this stuff right here was ten dollars and ninety five cents for one gram about one two three four yeah I bought I bought a fair amount of dope but this is a full full on seven grams of oil and as you can see it actually costs less than 100 bucks everything on top of it is totally 100 percent tax over $35 all right well there you have it you guys have a wonderful day I sure do appreciate it if you ever make it into a Washington State make sure your swing by check out nature's gifts give me a comment let me know what you guys are getting your belt for we'll see you later peace", "WE4H-gXnGJA": "yo what up boy bacon babe today I just wanted to do not really a Q&A but kind of respond to some of the questions that I've been getting in the comment section some of the comments as well we're not necessarily questions they're trying to tell me different ways to do things so I'm not opposed to taking advice only a fool would be but I am opposed to taking advice from people who are just talking but don't do if you don't actively press rosin don't tell me [ __ ] about how to do it because you don't know how to [ __ ] do it yourself I actually do it one of the comments that I had was that on one of my videos where I left a pre pressed puck inside the plates for too long while I was trying to prepare the camera so he did the material up a lot and when it came out it was a little bit darker than normal so a lot of people like to comment on that one and a lot of people are you know one person told me use less less pressure because you get more plant material in your end product and just let the heat lose it all out well that time [Music] Oh [Music] whoa whoa all right I'm still not over being sick completely sober all right so that's what I was saying um that's Bob that's backwards straight-up backwards you want more pressure less key you're not going to get more plant material in your product by using more pressure that's just not how it works the rosin bags that I use are 160 micron there from rosin evolution and they work perfect with my pre-press but you guys have to remember that when you're pressing out rosin the filtration bag excuse me those bags are not for filtration actually they're guesswork [ __ ] look they're just for containment so when you have that puck of flour and you go to press it it wants to expand and as it expands it will reach outside of those pressing plates and then you're not pressing that material anymore right so what the bags do is they don't filter to keep the plant material inside they just they keep it so that the plant material doesn't expand too far out because you could press nugs without any bags and still get all the oil without even collecting plant material the plant material only stays right along the very edge of the Google oil so again those bags aren't for filtering anything they're just for containment and make it a little bit easier what else pressing temperatures so temperatures - depending on your material you're gonna start as low as 180 and go anywhere up to like - 30 to 40 the fresher the material is the less heat that you need to use also the less time you need to press it if material is not the right humidity you're gonna have to press it for longer and you're not gonna get as good of a yield usually 60 to 70 percent relative humidity for your but it's good to start with and I'll usually press it fresh material like starting around 185 190 and if I'm not getting the yield I want but I'm getting the quality then I'll increase the the temperature by about 10 degrees until I start seeing the yield that I want now when you increase the temperature got to remember it's like a it's like a sliding scale right and right where they cross those two lines cross that's the perfect like settings right temperature time pressure so what you're trying to do is you're trying to get to keep high enough to make all of the oil lose out without degrading the actual material right so it's heat that degrades it not pressure so ideally you want as much pressure as possible without blowing out your bags right or breaking your parchment with as little heat as possible necessary to facilitate the flow of oil out of the material usually that ends up being around a thousand psi on your plates so for example my plates are 22 square inches right now to hit a thousand psi you know you're gonna have to get up there around like 13 14 tonnes because you take the max pressure that you're putting out so let's say you're putting out 10 tons that's 20,000 about 20,000 pounds of pressure now you divide that by the surface area of your plates which for me is 22 right and so I end up needing to be somewhere around like what is it I think like 15,000 psi or 15 tonnes will give me about a thousand psi so do the math on your own the base of yes the max pressure you want to get to and then you just change your temperature based on that so the higher the temperature the faster your product will start to flow right now this is where it starts getting tricky and it's a sliding scales because your temperatures too high you degrade your product but if it's too low then it has to sit in there and between those heated plates were too long even though it's a lower temperature it has to sit in there too long in order to start flowing and get the final yield so now you end up with the degrading product so like I said it's a sliding scale you want to have a high enough temperature so that you don't have to press too long but you don't want to have it too high to where it's degrading the product and then your pressure you're just going to keep ramping up the pressure until you don't get any more yield out of it so that ends up being like like I said fresh material 180 to 190 and about two and a half to three minutes for fresh stuff and then for older stuff it's usually I go a little bit higher and press rike around 210 or so for about three or four minutes but it also depends on the type of rosin that you want so a lot of people would see this and be like oh man that looks like like a big bunch of doodoo but this is your super Turkey stuff that's been pressed out at about 180 185 so you're gonna get more of the oily sheen on there right you're gonna get a lot of Terps and it comes out more like a sauce and this is cured this has been cured for about two weeks now and so this is just super super stable and this is really [ __ ] bomb but a lot of people don't like material that looks like this and keep in mind this would be super golden if I were to thin this out but a lot of people want like ghost rosin which is the stuff that is so clear you can almost see through it but people are into the purple rosin now there's a lot of trends but you can't let the color dictate everything because it's not just about the color right because of this stuff fresh bud pressed out at 180 there's a little bit darker and more Turkey than stuff that I've pressed out at higher temps of the same bud I pressed out at 2:30 you know and I've gotten slightly different looking material it was more shatter consistency way lighter color even though it was a way higher temperature right almost 40 degrees higher same pressed time actually was a little bit shorter with the higher temperature because it started to flow faster so I didn't have to press it as long you know this is some more 190 190 180 but you know you can get all different types of colors and consistencies and the point is that it doesn't necessarily dictate the quality it just dictates the parameters that were used when they pressed it so let's see what else you guys want to know cover filter bags temperature pressure time collection don't collect on anything too cold I made the mistake of collecting on top of some dry ice there was a protective surface in between but still the cold got the the rosin too condensate and create some moisture on top of the rosin and that's just because it got too cold so now I added moisture where I don't want to I want to remove it so that's a conditional time to cure and get that out properly but make sure that you have I would say like a couple is regular ice packs and then put it like a cookie sheet and I still look on mat on top of that and that should be enough to keep it just cool enough to collect easily but not getting moisture on it Oh a lot of people asked me about the the paper I use PTFE squares so I don't use parchment the reason I don't use parchment is because 90% of the markets parchment paper is covered in silicone silicon is very very easily broken down by a lot of different terpenes specifically D limonene which is very high and a lot of Turkey buds and so when you go to press you'll notice you have your little circle your puck of Bud and then around that puck there's like little box where it looked like it seeped through the paper or the bud is eating through the paper and that's actually the the terpenes eating through the silicon and then getting through the parchment paper so what happens when that happens is the silicon gets broken down by those terpenes and then when you're scraping up your rosin you're actually scraping up bits of broken down silica that get into your rosin and then when you when you ignite that or vape it burn it whatever that's toxic silica is extremely toxic when ignited and ingestion so those of you that are pressing on silicon treated parchment paper still chances are they're silica in your material you may not notice it but it's there now it seems a little bit easier to collect material off of parchment compared to PTFE if you do not have the correct temperature to collect it on if I were to place ice packs underneath this and then collect my material it comes up extremely easy way easier than parchment nothing gets stuck to this it's the most nonstick one of the most nonstick surfaces known and unlike parchment paper that is only heat treated or heat rated up to like 400 450 degrees PTFE is heat rated up to 500 degrees and pressure rated up to 500 pounds I think it is which is pretty significant nothing breaks through this in my experience I have not broken through a single PTFE sheet so that's why I use these I got a pack of one thousand four by four squares for 125 bucks from turkey roof comm or you can check out the version PTFE roll if you guys are doing bulk compressing with larger presses get a whole roll of this this is 14 inches across and I think this sheet was like maybe safety ET or something like that and this was like I think 100 something bucks it's worth it so think that covers and yeah it's depressing show me what you guys got if you guys have any questions comments please drop them below this was a very impromptu video I was gonna do like a whole little script and make sure I covered each bullet point but dabs happened and then I just started talking and here we are now so that said you guys have any questions about processing material growing anything like that drop them below I reply to almost every single comment if it's worthy of a reply show me what you guys would like to see in the next video and if you guys have any material that you want processed and you know the Southern California area hit me up and I'll press your stuff for you and I'll show you what it's like happy dabbing I'm about to hit this and I'm gonna be out of here [Music] [Music] we're hearing all the stuff in my email probably today because I'm impulsive and I have money right now all I need is another control box similar to the one that I built for my rosin press a PID controller and a plug-in spot for the coil that I already have so it shouldn't cost me a more than about a hundred bucks and I'll be able to build the control box for for the email and I won't be torturing anymore because [ __ ] this shit's annoying especially because I smoke in the grow room now because my wife is pregnant and I'm not trying to have her getting all secondhand smokey up in this [ __ ] so I don't smoke in the living room anymore which is where I usually chill and play video games so I got a run in here to take dabs or smoke and then run back out there in between rounds or games it's like man I wish the [ __ ] was just always lit always torched up ready to go I could just come in here drop it down and be out but I got to spend like a good minute and a half [ __ ] torching this [ __ ] up to get it clean and then let me cool off but it's all good oh yeah the I don't have any packs in here with me but I did make these little gel packs I rosin in coconut oil this shake is for I take four of those it's a wrap a rat I was in Chicago for business with my lady over this past week and that was what I would do I didn't take any flour and dab anything to smoke at all all I took was those pills I was a pill-popping animal and she would hate me like 3045 minutes after I take them and it was just kale like chili Hey [ __ ] dog barking for no reason Cheers [Music] I can't wait to not be sick [Music] whoo [Music] alright that's it for me they can be about catch you guys next time", "LlrJgCBATaY": "what up y'all chill boy bacon babe I just want to bring you guys a quick video showing you some different rosin I just got this gorilla glue rosin back from my boy who vac purged it for me because basically I collected on top of some dry ice and so the rosin collected moisture so you threw it in the back of him for me and as you can see at that fire fire looks really good really nice color see right through it so there's that one and again people will say that looks dark but it's funny because this is a gram actually this is a little over a gram and this is the same thing straight up clear but yeah oh the dust and the hair and it that people think right my shits clean so there's that right and then this will give you a different view so there's that and then I've got some of this gorilla glue which is the stuff that I've been smoking on for the past couple weeks and this is a thick little puck right here but it just goes to show you kind of the different consistency that you can get there's kind of squeezing this down just from how stuff cures you know this stuff is more stable and then I've also got some black sugar rose rosin that I pressed out earlier today it's a really low yield err so I don't really do it often but I got a gram and a half off of just under 10 grams so that's what I normally get around 12 to 16 percent of the range I think I've pulled on it it's got just a really cool color to it it's really stable grab this here you get y'all just breaks off so it's super stable and so I'm gonna go ahead and actually take a hit off of that I'm gonna go ahead and close up this big guy here close that up and that's about 36 grams right there so I'm gonna try and get you guys a cool shot of me pretty much dabbing this and the clean email hopefully I can cut through here clean get a nice strip off broke all right so you guys can see what that looks like and let's see if I can get this for you and this is fire [Music] superbomb super stable all right peace out", "UT5jSg_xnyQ": "some diamonds CCA diamonds this is blue cookie last stuff I made this rocket fuel turned out caviar didn't make me big Christmas there's a whole bunch of small ones oh this makes big crystals", "hOaTcLLeDXc": "and it was a good time and it was I was like [ __ ] it I was like I might just have to keep on doing this you know what I mean like it's not hurting me at all sup everybody YouTube's and really busting my balls about their Community Guidelines recently so if you're under 18 [ __ ] off Thanks ooh damn I hit it what's going on everybody welcome back to another episode of trying to find a new spot in my apartment to record at I don't know why I've never done this one I always record it like that seed or like in the middle right there it's kind of tough when your apartments like 500 something square feet is really small but hey we make it work baby you know what it is I think we might be moving out soon so just stay tuned for that anyway in order to celebrate 300,000 subscribers I asked you guys on my Instagram to send me questions I wanted like video questions I said it just like type in [ __ ] you can't really you know really get a feel for that you know what I mean so I wanted you guys to send in some videos of yourselves and I think you did stories only been up for like 20 minutes and I have like dozens and dozens of DM so it's a good time alright if I don't get your question I'm sorry but before we get to the questions you guys already know it's gonna be it's in slow-mo already we got the lighter we got the strawberry joint with the og cookie let's get really high in answer to questions man cheers everybody this is the 300k whoo [Music] hell yeah all right get to the questions well yes yeah what was your name uh axel bro for sure I'm going to roll in loud 2019 in Miami if you guys don't know you guys are in the area if you guys are going to roll it loud if you're not hopefully we can do a nice little smoke up a nice little meetup I know it laws over there aren't too kind but I think we can make it work bro so I very much appreciate you accent we're gonna get that [ __ ] going for sure hey my name is Roy oh I just had to fix a bunch of [ __ ] with my car so here's a good question what car do you drive what's your dream car mine's a challenge I think then [ __ ] thing's are awesome nice I currently drive a 2 Series Beemer it's the entry-level I don't know it looks sick it's really it's literally like the cheapest BMW that you can buy but everyone kind of thinks it looks chill and it looks so for me I was thinking about upgrading my car really soon and like getting a good trade-in value for it I think the plan is now I'm just gonna keep my car because it's paid off and I don't want to put on a little payment so I'm just gonna drive my car until I graduate and then when I graduate I'm gonna buy myself a fat ass with I'm already saving for it but I want it to be an everyday driver and I want it to be under a hundred grand alright none and I got it if they came in GT four came in Porsches PDK I would definitely cop that like that's like the for sure cop if I had any amount of money I would get a GT four I know everyone's gonna be like bro but the manual transmission but like dude it's a robot it makes you go faster he's like broom broom you know what I mean you know no no no Eric Congrats on 300k yeah enemy my question is what are you most excited about in sales in 19 and for everyone watching my birthday is April 21st I'll be in New York City DME if you want to come [ __ ] party this it yeah the party's Henry I'm ready for a lot of [ __ ] man I think the main thing I'm excited for if you guys don't know I made it my new year's resolution to travel once a month so I've done it already for the first three months this month for 420 we're going to San Fran next month I already mentioned earlier we're going to Miami hi in the summer months I don't know we're trying to plan something fat trying to be something cool because I've never even been out of the country and I never really traveled before this year but now I have the mean so you not have a reason to his YouTube [ __ ] so it's gonna be cool man that's what I'm most excited for I'm just gonna travel all over the country hopefully out of the country at one point he's got to find the right deals and then it's kind of worth it so hey travelin that's what I'm most excited for the youtubes shit's gonna be cool too but like I think the YouTube comes with the traveling you know what I mean obviously I'm gonna bring my camera obviously I'm gonna be smoking where I'm going so it kind of goes inside with one another you know what I mean it was good my name is Sam I'm here in Austin Texas yeah yeah I was born there if you do anywhere in the world up and just smoke chew and Julie scenery the view you know where'd you go oh this would have been a tough question like an hour ago but I I was just thinking about that actually it's kind of weird but the aurora borealis anywhere where I can see that I know there's a lot of countries in Europe or just like northern country you can probably see it in like Sweden and there's like a whole bunch of like Greenland Iceland I don't know I want to go roll up a nice fat joint and watch the aurora borealis and trip my mind maybe drop a little tab maybe I don't know probably if we're gonna be honest if I'm over there then yeah I'm probably gonna drop down the southern lights look pretty sick to you no one talks about that underrated but I mean the Northern Lights bro they're all green and [ __ ] like come on you know you trip balls looking at that yeah so this is an easy one I forgot your name what you're saying Mitch Mitch yeah all right this is an easy one man said it before I'll say it again I just balanced my [ __ ] by smoking after I'm done with all my important stuff so usually I'll wake up I'll go to school answer emails do all that stuff pretty sober and then once like the business day ends you know like 5:00 p.m. type [ __ ] then I'm just like all right [ __ ] off and I already streamed before that I start my stream every day at 3:30 so it's just like I'm kind of clocked out by that time I make sure I have nothing else like the main thing that I make sure of is that if I were to just smoke too much and pass out I wouldn't be irresponsible you know I wouldn't miss any deadlines or oh of course I just realized it was it was in 1080 man that's the worst anyway just make sure that if you get too high it's gonna be alright you can just Joe and be high cuz that's the worst thing to like when you're high and you're getting high and you remember that you have like homework you do or have to like edit a bit or upload a vid or I do this and then it's just like dams it's kind of like a buzzkill on the hunt you know I mean like I like a stress-free just chill chill high and if I have things to worry about and it's not gonna happen yo my name is Daniel and my question is what is your favorite strain right now right now yesterday right now oh shoot right now purple punch it's green it was Green crack for a while everyone the real fans know like bro Green Craig been your favorite for a while would happen purple punch man when you get the purple punch bud if you ever had some purple punch extracts like I had some lunch time as dude almost came like I almost like came soft that wasn't even hard or anything like I just [ __ ] almost came my pants but hey it was ridiculous so far but I'm Eric - Patrick I want to know the shirtless big come on bro Stan how long can I do a keg stand bro I don't have everyday cakes in my life I got shot gonna be real nice I can beer bong it'd be real nice I've never done a cake set man I'm a [ __ ] [ __ ] for that hey we'll get a cake Sancerre don't even worry about all right now that you put it in my mind I've actually never done any kicks in so I got you bro you were what session was probably the 42 grand moon rock even though that wasn't really one session if you don't want to count that that is probably the hounds in one sitting either one of them those that's I don't mean that that's a lot bro I don't really like blow down too hard like everyone gives me this leg this [ __ ] they're like bro I smoke like Suge like maybe you do bro I spent like two grams a day like including the stream to three grams a day probably like it's not that much I mean yeah smoking every day's a lot but I am 100% sure that there is a decent amount of you that smoke more than me I'm not worried but it isn't a competition bro like I've never been like dude I've smoked way more than that guy like that's just some some little dick [ __ ] right there man that is some little deed confidence right there what's up [ __ ] yeah appreciate that chase why did I start smoking honestly all my friends started smoking before me and I didn't really want to try it because like I heard all the [ __ ] in middle school was like you don't do drugs don't smoke weed like dude not do any of these things stay away from it her different parents are teachers counselors everybody so I was like of course I'm not gonna get involved my friends want to get involved they can't I'm not gonna stop him you know what I mean but as I kept hanging out with him I was like they're not really negatively effected like all these things that I thought was gonna happen to him like none of them happened there was still just who they were and they were just hi and I was like dude if I was like they can just be high and still be functional still do good in school still work their jobs or whatever and I was like I'm down so tried it out summer going into sophomore year of high school and it was a good time than it was and I was like [ __ ] it I was like I might just have to keep on doing this you know what I mean like it's not hurting me at all it's giving me a good vibe let's smoke some weed from now on and then the rest is history bro you already know what it is you know Eric your Inlet yo what's up Eric my name is Travis and my question is would you ever give up smoking for a job and if you would what John would have to be like that answer is so much different now than it was a year ago because like this this weed tube [ __ ] in like this this whole thing is actually leading stuff like a meeting companies that meeting all these people that are willing to give me jobs and it's like I don't think I'm gonna have to man but but let's just say all of it falls through let's say [ __ ] tomorrow Trump's like [ __ ] that [ __ ] you pot heads no more weed it all makes it federal again schedule one keeps it and it's just like completely [ __ ] then in that case I would give up smoking weed for a job that's like six figures probably like above yeah yeah that's like a comfortable living you know what I mean like I don't need to be a millionaire or anything but if I'm given a weed it's gotta be worth it you know what I mean it's not gonna be hard to give up like I don't think I'm gonna smoke weed forever if

sorry when it's over i will be the greatest it's her nose", "HjVnvEy-IkA": "what is going on welcome back to the I smoke Channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host Tyler Greene today we're going to be covering diamonds and sauce versus shatter two forms of cannabis extract but what is the difference and how in fact are they similar those are the questions that we are going to be answering in today's video remember to hit that like and subscribe button if you are feeling these videos that helps us grow rich even more people and get our message out there so without further adieu let's talk diamonds and shatter I've got my Chuck B glass piece originating in the USA for today's video it's getting out of the Pelle case so I can show you what it looks like oh yes and we are gonna fill it with water you ready and here we go we are ready to kick off the video let's put this pillowcase away the old one 120 Pelle case what you need if you're traveling with your glass let's talk about the difference between shatter and diamonds and sauce we're gonna start with the most familiar form of extract that you've probably come across for ready it is shatter and this has been on the market since at least a few years ago but all the way people have been extracting cannabis going back to the last century recently shatter has become a much bigger thing lead partially due to the advent of medical legalization and recreational legalization in the States that is where this was first super popular and now extracts come in this form so what does she look like shatter can have different coloration but is generally gonna look a bit more stable than other forms of cannabis extract when you get shatter you will know it is shatter because it will literally shatter when you break it you can see from the way that it breaks although some of it may potentially be a little bit more sticky but basically shatter looks like this this is some lovely mimosa shatter we got beer 710 this is what shatter should look like if it is clean it might come in a different color look at the consistency look at the sort of golden hue and just just look at it guys you can see that that is some nice-looking chatter if it's tiny or if it has got too much chlorophyll or aged plant material eg trimming it it might be darker and you might see shatter that's like really dark almost black looking I wouldn't really want to dab that anymore but have done in the past how does it differ to diamonds and sauce well let's take you through what diamonds and silks of Diamonds themselves are almost pure THC a crystals basically 99 point something percent tetrahydrocannabinol where is the source is a mixture of Turks some cannabinoids and the flavonoids giving it this lovely rich flavor profile not being an extractor I don't know too much about the process of creating diamonds in source but the source is a really Turkey volatile cannabis extract that is on the other side of the spectrum to something like shatter shatter has a really nice stability to it although it may degrade into a more waxy like substance over time particularly when not refrigerated as those turps cannabinoids flavonoids begin to break down into a delicious extract soup that's when you'll see shatter waxing up diamonds and sauce basically is like honey sort of looking liquid the diamonds are the crystallization of that so that could happen when the extract has been left in a pressurized compartment over time it begins to crystallize and over the last few years the process has been honed and developed until we start seeing big thca crystals that look like rocks basically and that is diamonds and source I really like the flavor profile you get on this I think it's very hard to replicate the diamonds and sauce flavor profile in shatter or even in fact in other forms of cannabis extracts the more stable something is the less in my experience is the flavor some exploded in my mouth you know a lot whether it's with the Diamonds and sauces so volatile goes turps something which is unparalleled so this is some lemon skittles diamonds and sauce you might be familiar with the skittles strain skittles with that is a really popular Cali import strain lemon skills in their skills cross and this is the diamonds and source of that straight away I can tell you that out the to extract this one smells really nice this one smells about ten times nicer you get a little bit of the aroma with the shatter but with the diamonds and sauce it is really really stinky in a really lovely way for the lemon citrus the skills sweetness you know that fruity pebbles types or a sweetness I've got both of them in front of me I can smell this one and I can't smell this one diamonds and sauce is going to smell a bit stronger because of the volatile nature of the extract you know it's lighter pea sauce shatters a little bit more stable than that stability means that you can pick it up with your hand as you see with this shutter I can just pick it up and hold it and that is because it is nice and stable allowing me to do that without it breaking down I couldn't pick this up and hold it I'd get it sauce all over my hands and that would be a waste we need Abdul for that so that's a comparison between shatter and diamonds and source hopefully I haven't missed much out do feel free to add your input your insights in the comments section I think that people will be wondering what the difference is between the different forms of cannabis extract and Shatter versus diamonds and sauce is an interesting comparison should we dab some first of all we're gonna start with these shatter this is mimosa another really popular cannabis strain that I'm sure some of you would have heard of so you can say this is Shattuck is as I'm digging my dad's hole into it it's literally splintering off into little portions you need to be careful with shatter particularly when cold that you don't accidentally flick it off of your your parchment paper and onto the floor sometimes it can be harder to pick up with a dab tool than than with your fingers as this is proving because it's just not sticky we are ready to go live with this dab of mimosa shatter and I'll see you guys on the other side wow that mimosa flavor is delicious but I do find with shatter he's sort of got a very slight chattery taste to it so you sort of can taste the form of cannabis extract it is now a wonder whether that is actually the lack of volatile Terps meaning that it's not as flavorsome as other forms now there is also something to say about open-loop blasting versus closed-loop distilled butane both of these forms of extract are extracted using a solvent it looks like this it is called butane and it is the same gas as goes into your blow torches your clipper lighters etc obviously handling this stuff in an enclosed environment is dangerous it is extremely flammable that is why it is recommended that if you don't know what you're doing do not try this at home I've spoke to more than one extractor that has told me that they've had an accident in the past and it's not really a little accident when it involves things like explosions and fire so stay safe people there are safer ways to make your own extracts at home just look at rosin all right should we do a dab of the diamonds and sauce and see how it compares to that in the motor shaft that we just tried I think we should it isn't the best shape to dad till family in diamonds and source actually but I think we're gonna be able to to get your nights tab allows a these looks great guys we're about to do this tab right now and I'll see you on the other side tears folks [Music] wowsa oh man all the flavor got me that dad makes your eyes forward sometimes that was intense that was expansive that actually gave me the sweats guys been a long time since I got the sweats doing a DAB the flavor of the lemon skills diamonds and sauce is absolutely incredible through the coffin I was able to get that delicious sweetness you know just as it smells it tastes and I've been dabbing that all yesterday I'm really loving that flavor so which is my favorite out of diamonds and sauce and shatter it has gotta be the diamonds and source guys and girls it is a delicious form of cannabis extracts able to give me the sweat after all this dabbing that's pretty impressive and it is certainly particularly that version of it a winning flavor and dabbing experience shutter is nice but it's got that shattering flavor but I think with the Diamonds and sauce you get this like magical level of flavor that you don't really experience anywhere else saying that though with diamonds and sauce you definitely don't need a big dab those crystals of THC a are expansive and very very strong and I just experienced that from a normal-sized dad got me quite a bit high up and giving me the sweats which I don't mind it's been a while since a DAB has done that to me but what do you think of this video folks what is your favorite form of extract have you tried dabbing it they leave your comments below this has run on to 24 minutes of filming supposed to be in a three minute video that has been the video comparing the diamonds and sauce and the shutter that's it for the moment as always thanks for watching and keep token stepping

300 bucks on all here jasmine hooked it up and we got an ounce of some flour and a couple grams of some concentrate so i'm really excited to check out grow healthy i haven't had the flour yet so i'm really excited and let's grab something delicious to drink for the weekend and i think we're gonna get this is one of my favorites all right my dudes let's take a closer look at everything we were able to get from grow healthy today they had some decent options and i really like that flower i was able to pick up a half ounce of this mine bird this is their littles it's not the best looking but it was 65 for the half ounce with the discount so really good deal there i also got some of their key largo some of the stuff's a little bit leafy but it smells really good i also got some bubba kush here's one of my one of my favorites it's a classic strain everybody likes bubba and we also got some star dog this is one of the better ones here but take a look at the queso pero i think this is the best flower i think it was the highest percentage they had in there i wasn't really looking for that but it's also the nicest looking buds i scooped their last gram of rosin it's the last one smells so good i'm stoked to try it and then i also got a couple half grams of some distillate and we're gonna take a look at these all right let's heat up a dab of this big pine tea lime rosin and before we dab just so you guys know we now have memberships available on the channel you can support the channel for as low as 99 cents check out that join [Music] button oh buddy uh where's my water at oh man this is so [ __ ] nice oh man this is good oh man that rosin is really good it's nice to have more dispensaries open up i think since i've moved here there's at least three or four new ones within a 10 mile 15 mile radius or so so it's nice to be able to go to more places have more options because that means better chances at deals one shop doesn't have a concentrated deal call the next one they don't have to check the next one so very nice to have more dispensary options overall that helps to bring the price down and increase the options because they're all going to be trying to compete with what do they have what do they have all right let's take a hit of their birds of paradise i did get the littles which is normally 99 for the half ounce that's a pretty good deal but i got it for 65 today [Music] oh yeah that was not bad i might hit some more flour here i've actually been out for a few days so it's nice to get a hold of some as much as i like dabs something about bong rips it always gets me damn oh yeah yeah yeah we're gonna get high oh man i just smoked so much and i wasn't recording i thought we were i just did the whole end of my video and everything and i look over to

going great for you we've got a little video here I haven't really done many of these but a lot of other cannabis content creators do these videos and I think a lot of people enjoy it we've got some strain reviews coming up today and of course we're starting with the hottest hash on the alerting rec market happy cabbage farms so happy cabbage farms they came into camp in probably about four months ago I don't know exactly when they came on to the Oregon rec market but at the time it was a pretty Minzy era in the Oregon rec market here in Benton there was just a lot of the companies have really slipped towards the end of the summer and a lot of their stuff really wasn't tasting as good as it was towards the beginning of the summer then comes heavy cabbage farms with hash robison and we don't see hot rods in a lot in the rec market because it's such an expensive and kind of niche product there's not very many people that are searching to pay a lot of money for hash rasam but when you [ __ ] try this hash frozen you're just sucked right on back in guys it is ridiculous this stuff I will tell you I have tried tons of hot rods and a lot of the times I'm going to say that's my favorite hat rosin because I don't get to try it very often happy cabbage now has been around for about four months and they are a group in our circle it's just been around I've gotten to dab it a lot and I've gotten to dab a lot of other hash rosin because I don't have to pay for it other people have it and I will tell you guys there's a couple strands that I have not liked from them but these four right here that I have are so titties I would stick my face between all of them and motorboat myself to death this is hands-down the best half rosin I have ever smoked and it's on the wreck more kit if you are over 21 you can buy this you don't have to [ __ ] buy it black market you don't have to pay the $120 for black market six star hash rosin it gets it cannot expensive for a while there guys so to see a company coming out with stuff that's between sixty and seventy five dollars and medic maybe even cheaper than that that's super impressive and just such a breath of refreshing air so this guy I've got open right here first thing when I open it this is the purple starburst og six star like just what in there is just a bad thing to say let's take a look at what we going got going on in this jar alrighty here we have the purple starburst og 6 star you guys can see it's nice and flaky there's no real huge clumps partly because I dabbed a lot of them partly because it is 6 star and it is just gorgeous look at that color sorry for the shaking I'm filming on my phone they check that out just absolutely gorgeous I am completely enthralled with the look of this rosin I'm enthralled with the look as well as the smell a second you open up this up you get hit in the face with the real ocean groan oh gee smell and it's been a long time since we've gotten that we're getting more chem more gassy oh geez out here this is real ocean groan oh gee and then on the end of it is like this almost faint hint of like purple lavender not in a floral way at all but in a very very gassy way like I can't even begin to explain this we're gonna go ahead and take it yeah we got two rigs out today we first we're gonna start out with the prophecy glass and get a little function shot and I'll shop for you guys we don't have the cleanest rigs or bangers today just kind of caught me on an off cleaning day but maybe we should still be able to see that function right we're gonna start off with the purple starburst it guys this stuff is absolutely amazing I cannot tell you how much I recommend going and trying just the strain right here all of happy cabbage farm is fantastic this strain right here hands down my favorite let's go ahead and get her heat it up and get into some freakin turf skies I am excitement for this video you can not believe how hard it is to have four jars of happy cabbage sitting in a drawer knowing you can't smoke it because you have to come with it it's literally heartbreaking I also want to give them a huge shout out for sponsoring the 420 of it at the Pacific Circle that was absolutely amazing they set up a tab bar anybody that came by could have their stuff a company that produces this high a product of this high quality of product just allow anybody to come up and smoke it no no [ __ ] questions asked is just amazing huge shout out to them for that call that good set a timer for 45 seconds alright we're gonna go ahead get in here and scoop ourselves out a nice flaky dab of this gorgeous six star here we go guys first dab of the half cab farms Cheers [Music] oh good lordy that is so delicious straight to the head immediately my whole head warm fuzzy dice feels delicious but you just know media we have strongest it because it hits you momentarily after you take it down man is a good video to be filming guys yeah I also got to say this is mind-bending how good that flavor is and how much flavor there is usually with a lot of even really good tasting dabs only a small percentage of flavor this there is a large percentage of flavor in that [ __ ] strain it is amazing how much you get out of it I love it for our first thing to have in the morning like if you got one dab to set your whole day straight that's it right there that purple starburst og alright move on to the next string I believe this one was a collab width Oh pull on a stick and throw it into my house I rip the [ __ ] alright I threw the Box away in the heavy collab on it [ __ ] oh no without gaps in garden Gadsden Gardens okay this one is a collab with Gadsden garden and this is Tropicana punch now this one has a much much different look to it let me give you guys an initial smell test it was like pomegranate and man what is that that is a good [ __ ] smell right there it was like pomegranate and fish I'm not like just weed but the actual cush like when you're exhaling a cush strain it smells like that oh man that's delicious now this one has a much different look to it way more waxy was this one what was this one called no just Tropicana punch hash rosin not six-star not their batter or their jam just hash shots but still absolutely delicious looking kind of looks like peanut butter and this was not what I do what it looked like when they gave it to me when it was cold it was much much more pretty and hadn't like waxed up into this solid state yet still [ __ ] beautiful we're gonna switch it up we've got the DBE 503 slimeball rig all ready to go over here a dab of this junk ambush I believe this is the one that gave me a job on the night of 4/20 and I was just absolutely mind blown by how good the flavor of it was so much rudiness to it but still keeping a really nice base in the OG gas cushy that kind of a chem that kind of a taste so I'm keeping it sweet waste in there but still having some food on top I'm a big fan of fruity strains but when I have to smoke all day every day it's not my favorite I really really want the Kim gasps og scum push stuff like that all right that's all set a timer 45 seconds that's not that's not the right dance isn't it there was a dude I'm just gonna stop him all right if vijaya tease this one's a lot easier to load up I'm just gonna take this a nice big chunk here boom I am gonna be so blitzed by the end of this guy's four dabs of hatch rosin and that I haven't gotten into this yet but I'm sure you guys read the title we're taking out Widowmaker at the end but yeah let's do it [ __ ] drop the dead Cheers [Music] [Music] get right with that safe before really really fruity but it keeps its [ __ ] feet planted firmly in a nice little og tastes good very clean - I mean like of course there's no solvents in it but a lot of other people's half-frozen I get a a wheezing in my lungs and that's usually the reason I stay away from hats Rossum as you guys can hear [Music] there is some coffee but there's no wheeze and that is what I love about this stuff it just seems so clean so pure you're tasting exactly what this amazing weed was meant to taste like guys we're going nips out go the [ __ ] nips out Jesus Christ two tabs of hash rosin in we've got the purple starburst and oh wait no the Tropicana punch and the purple starburst yeah okay yes yes boom so we've got punch breath up next this is their jam and this one unfortunately has slowly disintegrated in a series of very unfortunate dabs that were completely unavoidable but I think a little bit left so we have something for this video right here I'm gonna zoom the camera in so you guys can see it's really really clear and very very light in color but it is so ganbei good I can't even begin to tell you guys how many Terps they've got packed into that gorgeous little [ __ ] doing GM glove there when you get in this one it immediately has like a purple smell I use that to describe a lot away I don't know what the purple smell is I don't know what I'm describing there I'm sure there's some people out there that are gonna be like yeah and there's some people are gonna be like what the [ __ ] he's that high already but it does it smells purple purple with a hint of fruit punch on the end that's exactly what I'm getting clenched breath and it's really really cool how true their flavors are guys like you can't even begin to tell you how many other hot rods and strings like taste we're like this one's strong in and you taste it that's great it's amazing how many people just they'll name their strains anything just because that's what's hype that's what's selling right now these guys they've just got some fire a sweet in fire ass hash on the way out switching it back up again to the prophecy glass for our punch breath dab here I'm gonna go ahead and heat this up man guys given that Widowmaker at the end it's gonna be so brutal I have already baked like a cupcake my gourd is gone stone to the bone I just [ __ ] rent I think you guys a good idea of how ripped I am I've taken two gaps and I already am starving I don't feel like I need a turf map two naps like I thank you I'm taking seven gram damage guys this we just took like maybe point one maybe and I'm already ready for a turf down at the end of this I'm going to pass out right here after I've ordered new greens call it good BAM wham Shazam set timer for 45 seconds Thank You Carla alright let's go ahead scrape ourselves out some of this leaving just enough left to put into our Widowmaker jab guys we got we got some crazy stuff going with a maker jab this punch breath was definitely one of my favorites it was a lighter high than the six star starburst og but had just about the same percentage of flavor it's fan-fucking-tastic really allowed me to go about my day if I was smoking it in the morning before say a meeting or something it would be really good for that not if you were gonna go out and want a dad that was gonna last you three to four hours that would be the purple starburst six star that stuff is just [ __ ] tits it is so strong BAM Thank You Carla let's take this damn choose people it's tons tons and tons of flavor [Music] [Music] now we got the sweats going big time holy Jebus how is it is hot in here oh my god keeping you close holy [ __ ] this was a good fight hey promised the Widowmaker again oh [ __ ] turf sweats aren't [ __ ] real oh my god whoa next up we got some margarita punch six star don't let the nips cool off for a second here wow that overheated a needle is in the red Oh rubbie oh my god I completely forgot we have water over here not sponsored by but shout out the can event for carrying the happy cabbage four guys are in Central Oregon looking for a place to pick this stuff up get a man got it they got so many different strains oh yes we got one left guys we've got the margarita place six star same with the starburst og let's go ahead and take peak here in this jar very very flaky but it is all stuck together none of it is gonna fall out I don't believe ya all stuck in there when I first got it was flaky like if you sneezed it would go everywhere like a pile of blow it was pretty [ __ ] flaky oh man oh man this one probably actually I'm gonna have to take my my vote back for the smell this one has better smell than the purple starburst dojin form starburst oh gee I do believe tastes better but god damn margarita punch they're definitely a hint of that tropic punch in there but there is a kick what is that kick gasps that is straight gasp oh man yeah once you get past that punch just gassy oh that is good it doesn't have the og smell of the purple starburst I mean it is just Tropicana punch instead of deep purple starburst OG um but it does have a massive undertone of some gassy flavors go ahead keep the slime ball ring up last one and probably take a little two-minute walk around the house and then we're gonna dive into that way a but nothing's more currently done I am so big guy so I can feel my hind legs coming down [ __ ] just set a timer for 45 seconds Thank You Carla thank you very much I can feel my eyelids coming down like heavy hard it is I'm gonna be in for a real long afternoon here we got a photo we got the Gus glass show circle tonight [ __ ] I'm gonna be licking windows all night long guys so yeah super flaky super super potent smell let's get some [ __ ] taste in here oh yes oh yes wants to scrape it all off the bottom it is super flaky again yep all right we got a margarita punch six star and hash browns and over here I bring a ball right up in clothes for you guys kitchens function off the first initial hit oh my god I need a new cord after this video it's not even baked out of it it's just oh [ __ ] cheers everyone a lot more gas when you smoke it less of the push flavor than the go wow they're really not my favorite in terms of flavor definitely not bad whatsoever it's still delicious I'm probably ranked this number three the Tropicana punch probably be my least favorite out of the four but honestly I would buy all four strains again thanks they say that they're that good all scraped up on a piece of paper see if we can get it um damn er and then we will take a lap mop it off a bit and take this [ __ ] Widowmaker all those cobbles alright we got our four grams right here I have completely forgotten which one goes to which cap so that will be interesting we're just going to go ahead and see if we can take this damper here and get some of each of these on here it's not going to be a monster dabbe but I mean big enough for some fun boom there's our starting scoop of the punch breath now this is this is the margarita punch now this is gonna be a little difficult this stuff is so flaky I'm not quite sure we might have to get like a spoon for this so I'm gonna just take some of this and yeah there's no way it's gonna stick on there take that off and then last but not least we need the what what was this I forget [ __ ] I think I've lost more oil in here than I got out definitely alright well there's that there's what I've got and there's also some on this damper too this stuff has all different consistencies let me see if I can't like splurge some of this long as dabber just smush it all together that's kind of working I'd say that's working pretty damn good alright let's look at our dab here guys oh [ __ ] yeah oh Jesus alright alright let's let's get her going oh my god this is gonna be fun I literally didn't move any of this because I was terrified that the dab would fall off the dabber I think we are very lucky and fortunate that we got all that hash onto a bro without any of it falling off I didn't I think that was going to happen as this on a monster Widowmaker but like I was saying before guys - dabs in I was pretty [ __ ] toasted we're at a point now where I am just I'm good at I could be good for today for
