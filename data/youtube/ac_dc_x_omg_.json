Like, a lot. - Okay, high schoolers\nsmoking weed? That's no good\nfor their lungs. - Aw, look at the birds.\nOh my God. It just went right through\nhis skin. - \u266a It's Taylor Gang\nSo turn my sound up \u266a \u266a And mount up\nand do my thing \u266a - I didn't really know that\nI knew so many of his songs. - It's not my favorite.\nI don't really like rap. - I really don't really like\nabout how they talk about smoking weed and drugs,\nbut once again, I could definitely see\nhow people like these kinds of songs. - I just kinda like it.\nIt just feels like something you could just\nput on and relax to. - It's very interesting to see\nhow these rappers these days were inspired by older rappers\nand now you see people, older rappers collaborating\nwith new rappers to make new music.\nThat's very cool and amazing because we get a mixture\nof both. - (FBE) So, Snoop Dogg\nhas been making music since 1992.\nHe's sold over 30 million albums and is considered by many\nto be one of the greatest rappers of all time.\n- That's crazy. - That seems like a lot\nof raps. I guess he got lots of money. - I agree.\nHe is a great rapper. He's been around for\na long time and he still continues to make great music. - He's good, but there is\na few better rappers out there. - I can see how people\nthink that. He has such a big name.\nI feel like even if you haven't listened to all of his songs,\nyou just know his name. - (FBE) He's also noteworthy\nfor having several different nicknames over the course\nof his career and we have a few of them\nfor you to check out. - Okay. - Snoop Doggy Dogg.\nSnoop Dogg, with two Gs of course. - Why is there two Gs?\nI thought your printer wasn't working right. - Snoopzilla.\nThe Doggfather. Like the Godfather.\nThat's funny. - Snoop Lion.\nDJ Snoopadelic. - Calvin Cordozar\nBroadus Jr. Did I pronounce that right? - Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr.\nIs that his real name? Oh. - If I were a rapper\nor a musician, I definitely wouldn't go\nby a long name like this. No wonder he made his\nname Snoop Dogg. - (FBE) Given that he's changed\nhis name so many times, what name do you think\nbest suits him? - Just Snoop Dogg. - Snoop Dogg suits him better\n'cause I've always known him as Snoop Dogg. - Snoop Doggy Dogg.\nI just like all the dogs. - Snoopzilla. - Snoopzilla.\nI think that would fit him the most. - Either the Doggfather\nor just Snoop Dogg. - Snoop Dogg, 'cause I mean,\nla dah, dah, dah, dah. \u266a It's the one and only\nD-O-double G Snoop Dogg \u266a - Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr.\nIt's a cool name. You should keep it. - (FBE) Well, Snoop Dogg's\nhad an interesting career arc starting off as what some\nwould consider to be a gangster rapper with\nlots of swearing and smoking and not being someone that\nparents would want their kids to listen to.\n- Yeah, 'cause if you smoke too much, it can damage\nyour lungs and then \u266a dun dun dun dun \u266a\nYou will die. - (announcer) Dark. - (FBE) So nowadays however,\nhe's considered much more of a popular public figure,\nhaving appeared in numerous mainstream films,\nTV appearances, and even has his own\ncooking show with Martha Stewart.\n- He does? - What? - Since when? - Martha Stewart, reall--\nokay, I actually really like Martha Stewart,\nso if you're watching this, I'm a big fan. - (FBE) So, do you think your\nparents would be okay with you listening to him\ngiven how much he's changed over the years\nor do you think that some of the things you saw\nin that video still make him someone who's\nnot okay for kids? - Well, some of that one\nmusic video, inappropriate one. That one I wouldn't\nrecommend for kids. - My mom wouldn't really\nban me from listening to it, but she would frown upon it.\nI would still consider him a little inappropriate \njust 'cause especially the music videos about\npeople in their underwear. - I think it would be okay.\nhe's more of a meme now. - My mom used to listen to\nit all the time. My dad, he still listens to it\nall the time. I think they'd be okay. - My mom and I listen\nto it together. It's fine.\nI don't think it's anything-- some songs, my mom's like,\nyeah, you're not listening to that, or some songs,\nwe can listen to that, but you have to have\nthe clean version only. - My parents would be fine\nwith it as long as they were probably with me\nas I was listening to it. If he started in 1992 and now,\nthat's a 20 year difference, so I feel like someone\ncan definitely change how they are and how\nthey view things in the world in 20 years. - Hey guys, it's me

YouTube welcome back to fast electronic and loud here this is Ryan get something up for you we're gonna I'm not sure many part miniseries this is gonna end up being but we'll take a look at at least the first step here sure you folks have seen a lot of videos on YouTube you know LED light kits some of them come on a roll some of them do not someone come with remote some don't some come with a power adapter some don't you get the gist they're all over eBay Amazon will put links obviously in the description below a lot of people are using them you know backlight anything I mean in their cars or house they're bars what we're actually gonna do here fast electronic and loud is we are gonna unbox one of the five meter LED uses the 50-50 which refers to the size and type of the LED the bulb comes with one of the 44 key infrared remotes we're gonna use that this particular package ordered through eBay was 28 dollars and it included the power adapter as well so let's die without further ado let's get into it because we're actually gonna use this LED light and I'm actually going to kind of build like a custom little frame to sit behind my television so I actually backlit the entire TV so it you know it's dark we can change the colors and we'll show you that you know in the next couple series to make sure you subscribe we've also got a contest going away giveaway right now so make sure you check that out on our Channel so without further ado let's get into and take a look at you know how these kits come when they're shipped these are pretty standard how they're coming you should receive the role of LED lights should come in a probably they come in a pouch very similar to this just warning caution this bag contains moisture and electrostatic sensitive devices but an open this bag here it's just a ziplock there's open let's set that off to the side here you see here this is the actual role of LED lights there's a connector on one end connector on the other end these simply roll off and if you look on the back here there's already 3m adhesive tape on the back included on the whole roll and this is the 5-meter these are the 50-50 RGB LEDs so you look here on the strip there's a about every 2 inch there's a gold contacts here this is actually where you know if you only needed maybe say this much of the LED roll you actually would cut there and then use your other end if you need you know four to connect for your power source so these are convenient you know there's the ones out there you know that are pieces you know and then you have separation then you can connect them I'm actually conjuring a whole system using all of them so that I can have it extremely brighter without any type of loss so this is just on the standard roll and use a standard 4 pin connector on top there's got gold contacts and I'll show you that here a little bit closer here in just a second also included with this is some of them don't come so make sure you check the one you do get this one came with me this is your AC power adapter AC DC adapter just a standard little outputs 12 volt 2 amp max output plug this into your wall here's the other end and I'll show you where this other end of that power adapter goes should get some other box or some type of packaging similar to this we're going to open that up include it also here this is basically this is your RGB or red green blue control box so this has the infrared remote control which is what this is this is where you'll point the remote control so that you can control your LEDs because this has a 44 key remote you can do custom colors there's like quite a few things you can do and I'll show you the sheet there for that so this basically this is where our adapter that we just showed you you plug this into the wall you're going to plug this in here now you actually have the regulated correct power source and like we showed you that for pin that came out the you'll notice that's the same 4-pin right here so these nothing more or less plug right into those and clip that together and that would be connected included in this little box also very hard to read here these are operational instructions of the controller this is a 44 key remote so they just you know tell you to look you know to amp on each color you know DC 12 volt which is you know our AC DC adapter that we have talked about you know increasing the brightness lowering the brightness turning them off and on different type of static colors whether it be you know why blue you can do a seven color fade change there's quite a few things so just make sure you take a look at that follow the instructions there it's quite simple and I'll just show you how you know which operations on the remote and I'll show you the said remote these are pretty standard they're coming with every single kit that I've seen out there it's your standard four key 44 key remote comes a little plastic here but and pull that plastic out as it shipped there is a battery in the remote folks but if you're sitting here wondering oh it doesn't work it doesn't work there is a plastic pull tab on the bottom of the remote that's to keep the battery from going well basically being used during transit shipping sitting on the shelf what-have-you this does take a standard watch battery it's a cr2025 there's one already in here shows you how to open and close that to get it out there's this little plastic pull tab you want to make sure you pull on that that's actually now allowing the battery to make contact on the side the remote you can see it's full feature about 44 keys if you look at the instruction manual like here for example the smalls it made me it's laid out exactly as the keys brightness rise brightness rise brightness fall brightness fall for example pause run pause run on and off on and off you get the drill just look at these it lines up exactly and I believe these instructions are on line from the particular vendor but here's the card itself so you just take a look at that as you need so these are this is the remote like we talked about that comes with it this was the like we talked about this is a actually control box this is where when you push the remote it goes to the infrared signal here and inside the control box the way this is wired will dictate how it's coated so make sure everything's plugged in there so let's just I've got a little power source here so let me just take a second here and we'll uh undo the twist tie that came with this ac/dc power adaptor and I've got a little power supply actually conveniently located next to me so we plug that in real quick here I'm going to show you guys exactly what this looked like so we got that plugged in we got the power here got that plugged in the power I just want to plug that into our white control box which we've done and then we're gonna take our other end that was supplied into the led here I'm not gonna run these too long you don't want to generate a lot of heat with the LEDs still on the roll so sometimes you can see the arrows here point there's a arrows on each side arrows on each side it's only gonna go in one way even though it looks like it will so when you see there you made the right connection well I have power that's also another good way to tell so just get that clipped in there so you see that these lights here you know you can take your remote here we could just fire those off if we like and the lights are off you can turn those back on here you know maybe we wanted a little brighter maybe we wanted a little dimmer so we can actually decrease the intensity of that we can make it solid color if we like that's red green blue white let me go ahead and kick off a couple of these studio lights here and we can actually take a look at the color and see what how what it what you folks think so here I've kicked off a few of the lights here in the house and you click one more off now this is actually the white this would be the blue this is the green red you can do patterns you can do a you know multiple different very Asians of colors they're 4040 remotely said each one's labeled so you know I'm just kind of showing you a couple of the different colors that exist right now and a couple of the lighter options versus just solid you know white you got the blue the green the blue is varied I like the blue it looks extremely bright let me open up a few of these LEDs here seeing kind of maybe see the intensity of these colors extremely bright folks I know you've seen these getting them in behind something actually is gonna give it that effect that you're looking for so you're gonna want to make sure you get everything plugged in dialed in and do it the right way you want to guys want to see these plugged in again and just go ahead and take your power supply get that plugged in there and this just kind of pushes in it goes one way that's all connected they're they're lit up you can see they're on the roll here I'm not gonna run them too long as they will generate heat with it on the roll doesn't warn about that but I just know a little bit about this technology so you might notice that they do kind of smell there's a kind of an odor to these lights not powered on just getting them out of the package these are just LEDs on a circuit board and they lay a whole strip and then over the top is just a silicone gel basically that they put on any type of circuit board just to protect it and because there's a lot of it's been in a package you might get a smell so just get them out of the package and air them out I don't notice it now so maybe you guys harness those DD as me so like I said that's the little LED 50-50 this is the five meter roll does have 300 LEDs it's the 50-50 style LED bulb multicolor does like we talked about came with the 44 key remotes also came with the power adapter which some of the kids do not and did also come with the RGB or red green blue control box that's how you actually get the remote and through the computer and how that's wired on the circuit board in that box to get your lights to do what they want so let me show you guys just one more time case everybody missed that here let's go ahead and turn off our LEDs for example turn them off right now let's go full dark and then we kind of made me give the effect of what that's gonna look like so now we're blacked out folks here so pretend you're in your room your house right now and we can turn these back on that's full blue there's white green red you get the gist so once those lights are actually hidden for example let's say you know this particular might hit where my hand was where is the TV if you can imagine my hand now is just red lit behind there and actually instead of seeing the LED you'll only see the glow from behind you know for example if you want to look at the box here this little white box if that's your television you know you've got a mount on your wall now you have the lights behind that you can see the glow that is coming from behind the box that's the effect we're gonna do some actually I do for my company provide multiple different solutions for come businesses residential check us out sometimes so like I said there's a green there's blue white you got the multiple patterns you can do speed we can slow it down we can do you know it I mean pretty much anything we want we can fade colors if you want to set pattern like that you can fade them a different way fade 7 fade 3 you can make it just jumper flash colors so these are actually pretty cool we'll see how long they last so I just want to give you guys a real good review and an unboxing of these so just you know once you guys take a look at it you know hope you guys have enjoyed that the unboxing there of these that rolled LEDs it's pretty light bright I can't wait to actually get these behind my television get them all set up so this was brought to you by fast electronic and loud where we always bring it to you fast electronic and of course loud thanks for watching please subscribe you", "wB6B5Rps_ng": "it made them switch to cuz he pressed you

hard and he's so fat he could be you one day oh yeah you could be a drunker master wheezing your fart says attacks I mean they're already kind of our attacks the only downside of this character is when he throws up because then I'm vulnerable I can't I don't think I can do anything well why is he stopping the drink stop stop in the drink No know why I'm being defeated by a fart okay this time I'm not [ __ ] this up drink drink it all by how's this killer watch that's how it kills a robot that should not break it apart yeah he literally filled it and it's not even a robot it's a cyborg so the inside still biomechanical and so you stuffed it down his throat and and then put the match in there and alcohol is flammable so and plus the oil and stuff in his body bloom up and the stuff that he's drinking is like insanely strong alcohol it's the only way you can get drunk I remember this because it's the best was the best move on this carrot he always needs the fart you can't he can't go anywhere drinking and pardon me that like reflects everything that's hitting like I said earlier so you're only saving grace it's the only thing that you can do that saves you from my attacks love me

something like that yeah oh gods among us when newsdesk shock and all he did was jump around yeah that's literally all he does you're just jump or four Krauts uppercut and then he's every when he's losing he presses start so he can look at his moves over and over and over again so that it freezes your player and then he just press to start real question then goes boom boom boom boom yeah that's a combo every time that's why I don't plays him that's why I don't let him play ps3 anyway oh yeah he cheats that's how you cheat in this key he finds any way to make you stop hitting him and then he

office president baby I feel like that's from something is that from something now I have no idea present it baby have you ever seen the movie idiocracy no I hear it's pretty funny though here it's definitely worth the watch yeah I remember you telling me that uh like there was this like keyboard that was like really stupid but then like keyboards are nowadays are becoming closer and closer to just like yeah turkey board you know I'm like Windows tiles on how the icons on that is just like mail it's a picture mail it'sit's [ __ ] like that only its the entire keyboard and emojis are so advanced these days that the key boys just gonna be nothing but a bow cheats showed me this picture of somebody who like customize their keyboard to have nothing but like Pokemon pictures like all over there keep water I was like how do you know what anything does actually maybe like like Pikachu would be P and then like all the sword will be B look at that [ __ ] ok I was like deeply cinematic about to do boss you're destroying nature Thank You Kojima look at them titties bounce Oh butterface you know what they remind me of is on the board from Star Trek only hotter obviously loudly porn most likely start checkpoint probably I guess I can't really deny that right now now that was a really don't forget me obviously so this is a boss fight well do you have to fight them technically no oh alright it's it's preferable if I could get past these guys without fighting them kids you know you don't want to you don't ever want to fight the school they're a pain in the ass all the time hi remember what it was now I was watching american dad and so [ __ ] i think it was like season 11 or 12 or something was like the last season they showed on Fox yeah and I guess I got me what did I know uh TNT oh maybe don't quote me on that I had no idea they moved over yeah apparently they're doing really well they were originally going to only do like one season and then it did well enough and they like greenlit like three more seasons or something like the first season was like 13 episodes and then the seasons after that I like full-blown like 20 sip sucks so this was a waste so I guess is doing well that's but there was this uh this one episode where it was in the new stuff that Stan got kidnapped in like this [ __ ] third world country prison and they were talking about how like machines are going to obviously make like humans obsolete and [ __ ] like that yeah and a deputy director Bullock who is voiced by patrick stewart was he was trying to become a robot in the middle of the episode so eat like they get kidnapped and hands up breaking in in this like giant like mechanical robot likes oudhia's like these [ __ ] like spider legs and he's like guns and [ __ ] and he had this thing out of his head and it looked like the Borg and I was like how do you think that's making fun of like the board because I guess John guard became one of the Borg at some point yeah he does I don't know what happens after that though like I've seen the picture of him being bored but I wasn't Lee stops being bored of it look we can climb some other time other than that one is free no idea but I'm worried for another episode shoes we can finally climb a wall i get set in the beginning of the game yeah that's use next to memorize clearly yeah so I was never a Trekkie I was always more of a Star Wars guy but my wife is a Trekkie she would probably missions would be a tricky funny if you're watching this and you're totally not because you don't watch any of my videos because she hates you obviously because you hate me but whatever happens is jean-luc Picard after he becomes the Borg anybody anybody even in the comment below anybody who it's killing that inside he might anybody who want to become the honey Wow instantly Donnelly oh not just pissed them off whoa oh [ __ ] I think they look I'm like it crazy like I guess this is like the enhanced calls but what do they call skulls really just skull still yeah I don't know if it's the same ones I'm finishing it is then just wearing my sarbear because you know what would they snipe they got to take off all their clothes quiet well obviously he immediately that they just watch it just like her I know she was she was the first and the best and everybody's just trying to mimic her well obviously I mean she is the hottest way the game these are obviously just poor emulations I heard that there's a female soldier that you can actually like save in this game yeah I bet you can play as and you're gonna actually play as her through the whole game yeah you can actually play as this handful of people you could play as if when you go to your like mission loadout yeah you start prepping your equipment and stuff like that that's where you actually change your character that's cool yeah I mean it's nice the only downfall is you lose the ability to use your no matter which I guess isn't bad until you get rocket function in your Elijah wow I rocket publish everything look at me I'm Tony Stark actually I wonder if you get that that's a [ __ ] arm attachment was literally firing up [ __ ] ladies here it's got the sound affected everything that would be badass know what it is sweet wait the villa well you know Wow OOP you know that a drug lord lives there well you know you're in Africa it's probably like track blood diamonds and all kinds of stuff like this I'll just crawl along oh I could tell you he's totally looking the other way now make in the grass and just rich somebody else taking the grass hey I didn't oh [ __ ] maybe I did so I guess I let's do something I don't know if soon but maybe we gonna play that for home the target play what I last two outs last school yeah I heard so we played out last one yeah which started off as me and you and then everyone's I like scheme I one which started dan and Noelle's random shenanigans to be just ran their shenanigans oh you know it is wet it's fine it's fine I don't mind it definitely made for some interesting conversations as well chipotle oh that's that's me that's the one thing i did thoroughly we've been i do very much remember chipotle good time but I yeah I guess I'll let us come on Finn like I guess so we never played the whistleblower DLC but apparently like your dick chopped off with it once yeah apparently in the whistleblower DLC which is like how it's a continuation or if it's like a prequel or something I think it's a prequel it's whoever that cuz I it out last euro reported going to the place because you got a tip from someone and I think in the the deal so whistleblower DLC yeah you're not going to call the tip hook that actually makes quite a bit of sense between being named whistleblower but yeah apparently you like get your dick chopped off and then people are all like like I guess some people played the the second one at a three and they said it's just more of you getting your dick Wow is this how it's awesome however since after the first pallet him getting the dicks champ tough well you know they gotta outdo themselves so the only way to do that shopping off more dick yeah but like what's you like it feels like once you've chopped off one dick you've kind of reshop doff all the gift optimal you can't hit the pinnacle right like what's worse than chopping off a dick Cho chocolate to dick yeah i mean what do you follow up with that chopping off blue dick feeling to it dawg well you know there is d dog in this game we could tell they make that a thing well he was just regular dog before until we feet fed him and now he's Dido that's how he got his nickname and I know a lot of people think the ds4 diamond now we know imagine turning him like him turning back around this is a guy standing in front of him he's just get the [ __ ] out of a holy shift could swear there was a door in front of me where's your silencer I took it off and why do you have you regular pizza sub cuz I want to kill this guy yeah I have no idea what he says wish you just speaking gibberish man he's like speaking in tongues gotta put him down now man that dude lid all those candles with power of his mind [ __ ] with look even waited us for what to walk past some of the cans before he lit more of them well you know oh my god it's [ __ ] Dracula obviously seen his eyes I don't think you can see anything nothing but a million whoa you don't question glad to pass okay I love how you just welcomes you with open arms has infected your band they'll never sing the same again you should be nice we should get a new singing speaking of um so ACDC is on tour and this is obviously super old news by the time this comes out yeah but uh Axl Rose was singing for ac/dc while they were on tour and it's a parasite oh it had like I like a ring around it like it was like drawn but they didn't like fully add the alpha channel to it so you can see like the actual outline of the you know what I'm talking about yeah yeah you know that's that's its bowl shield obviously everything's got a bubble shield these days dan come on get with the program anyway no rather than argue this it but I'm about to smoke a peace pipe come on this is the herb they just like yeah [ __ ] give your all troop marijuana see how they react in this war anyway so Axl Rose is the one singing for the night I guess um the lead singer I guess he heard his ears really bad so he he can't sing because of the amplifiers and everything like you just can't do it it's basically too loud for him so I can't really blame him but I guess they got Axl Rose to do it like the lead singer from Guns and Roses and like I love guns and roses like the early stuff like welcome to the jungle [ __ ] a sweet child of mine yeah all that [ __ ] November rain and mermaid was always too depressing and I love ac/dc too but like I just don't feel like it's not bad but at the same time it doesn't really sound like ac/dc it almost feels like an ac/dc cover Bay doesn't you know yeah well basically it basically is at this but I mean you know it's better than some other bands like what is it three days grace I think there's only one guy from the original band at this point I didn't hit Japan said they shocked everyone out you know sucks is a like the one thing everybody's wanted for like rock band was the appetite for destruction a soundtrack from Guns and Roses their first album they did but they finally were like okay sure whatever will give you some of our songs i am [ __ ] Chinese Democracy really what you know that was oh come on i wanted to promote it but your [ __ ] / man oh to be fair it's chinese democracy the song is actually probably one of the better songs on the album oh hey Ken Noel save Dracula on the next episode I can walk him around in a circle Laura I know he's like he's like a like a butler butler yeah I shall take you to other face and you will be Bob Butler little seared

subscribe and hit that notification bell so you'll be notified every time i drop rock content so with this installment of rocking in the first degree we're going to be looking at richard ramirez who took being a fan way too far now ain't gonna waste no more time let's get right into the story richard ramirez was born february 29 1960 in el paso texas the youngest of julian and mercedes ramirez five children but one of the things that might have contribute to his future action was his older cousin miguel who was a decorated green beret who boasted about gruesome killings and would go as far to show young richard polaroid photos of victims vietnamese women he had raped plus a picture of a severed head of a woman he abused sheesh that's crazy to add fuel to the fire he watched as his cousin fatally shot his wife in the face with a 38 caliber over an argument but later that year richard would move to l.a with his sister and began using lsd and cultivated a interest in satanism he would later start committing a string of unspeakable crimes which one included a nine-year-old chinese-american mean laying in the basement where he lived he raped and beat the girl before stabbing her to death hanging her body from a pipe another murder in the city of rose mid on march 17 1985 took a special meaning for ac dc and their fans after he left the head bearing the band's logo danes only worsened when a childhood friend said he had always been a huge ac dc fan but on august 30th 1985 would be cut visiting his brother in tucson arizona which included him running across the sand and the freeway and trying to carjack a woman but ac dc wasn't pleased with people associating the killer with them telling behind the music we thought this is crazy i mean why are we connected anyway and after his friend did the interview that definitely didn't make things any better coming up with headlines like ac dc music made me kill at 16. that's crazy but on november 9 1989 ramirez was sentenced to death but throughout the trial blurred out things like hill satan and saying i don't mind dying dying doesn't scare me i'll be in hell with satan ultimately i see dc played no part in the conviction but ramirez had since died but not by government means he fell victim in 2013 to liver failure at age 53 inside saying clinton's death row that's crazy so uh man what do you guys think about that story i mean i know we hear this story countless times with people saying the music made me do it or the devil made me do it so you guys get in the comments and tell me what you guys think about this we're almost to 200 subscribers and i appreciate everybody who's like and subscribe and i'm just i'm going to be here creating more rock content i got more stories on the way fresh new stories and everything so you guys continue to rock with me and we'll rock out", "ZjAbgsUXfOA": "alright i'm back with another hackintosh video and this is a tutorial that uh quite a few people have been waiting for so before I get started let me explain a few things right now you're looking at the bootloader screen and I'm preparing to install lion on the day of Austro 1510 alright so what do we need first things first to get here you need to use Tony max unibeast program or his application to create a boot loader um you can create a boot loader on a USB device but I didn't do that I had an extra hard drive and I used my hard drive as the bootloader device and I did that by using a device like this hard drive enclosure all right plug hard drive in there close it plug it up voila USB device okay then uh after that I put the hard drive into the computer and this is what you see now if you need help using unibeast you can go to a my partner site um I play our hack click that link above the screen and better get your feet wet just in case you haven't been there yet and you you know you need some help uses unibeast you can just always come back here copy i'm not going to where I'd be still here all right now let's get started for those you who are ready or are at this point already this is what I did ok you zoom in here bed I used a boot command ok boo command is hold on cuz i want you to see this use the dash V alright hit space I had arch equals i386 because we're going to boot in 32-bit mode then I hit a space again and tight graphics and a blur equals no now here's the trick at one point this wouldn't work for me so I had to hit this the tab zoom out alright that's what it looked like when I hit tab I can always go back to the original boot low screen if I hit tab again alright so you're just going to keep it here for the sake of argument and we're going to boot from this okay here we go we in show you how simple this is keep in mind we are using a retail version okay I've already made a pre pre partition for this post partition pretty whatever you want to call it but I've already made a partition is ready for installation so if we click customize there would be nothing there so I don't want everybody to get on people to be scared like hey I mean what do i what do I select for customization like you know like I a coast so there's none of that in here so you don't have to worry about none of this stuff just pick your a pick where you want the other mac OS to be installed and hit install simple as that now this is the part where I say I'll catch up with you later so I'll catch up with you later alright we're back okay see we installed now we're gonna put in the same ok man we put in before but I you're gonna need to have a USB keyboard and you'll see why in a bit so here we go with the boot commands resuming yes I'm gonna get a good look at that all right all right way in there now this is what I meant by you need to have your USB keyboard so I'm going to plug my end all right and we're in there all right let's go through all the gobbly goo yeah now the next step is going to be much simpler than this this is where it gets interesting I micardis test lion Oh 9 let's just say I'm in Philadelphia ok all right here we are down to the final step real simple what we need is multibeast all right we got that here and we need the pic excellent files hexham files needed like the dsdt that is definitely needed for this installation and we need checks over black x now let me show you the reason we need this is because I'm going to see my hand I'm pushing the volume and there is no sale matter of fact there's no Wi-Fi see so another thing is watch the mouse if you can see it clearly hold up we zoom in a bit you move the mouse around it appalls for one split second it's like that ok now the files in this folder will fix that alright so let's get started okay now first thing we have to do is take the dsdt file drop it on the desktop just as simple all right we have multi bees continue continue continue agree and in our selection we're going to go to user dsdt nothing else team install password we just sit back and relax until it's finished and we move on to the next step all right now when it's finished it's going to leave a foul at extra file right here it's gonna leave that on your desktop all right so don't be alarmed don't think you know something happened it does that now our next step we are going to go into our OS X Drive and we're going to going to see a extra folder multi bees left us this folder so we're going to click that now pay pay attention to this okay good attention to this alright i'm in my folder my Gavin le photo and I'm gonna take this extra folder I'm going to take everything in here and put it in the one that multibeast created for me so basically i'm going to replace those folders those files and folders alright replace four plates alright now just so you understand what I just did you're going to go back in together Nellie folder now you see the extra folder is empty all right now last but not least we're going to open kicks over ah let me bring it down now we're gonna go in to gather le folder we want to go into this one right here line s / l / e alright that stands for system library extensions so we're going to click that we want to take these files right here and we're going to drag them up for a second in sidekick supper just drag-and-drop password in it okay alright we done now what I want to do is I want to double check and make sure these files was installed alright so i'ma go to system library extensions okay i'm gonna click this one right here then I'm a click date modified and it shows right here all the files that were added huh it serves like me see one of the files just might be missing you all right now it did not did not install that kicks that audio kicks so let's do it one more time this time we just want to add that at audio kicks which is this one right here apple HD a now let's see if everything else work let's try to Wi-Fi oh here we go okay just picking up my connections now sometimes it is say it failed so what you do is you turn off Wi-Fi and then you turn it back on and then you try to rejoin using your correct password and let's refresh the browser to see what happens there you go I manually put the audio kicks in and let's see if we have sound alright now let's see we got the quartz extreme thing going on here alright look how smooth that is at its move all right what else where's the time machine you know what I have to set it up for you to see the little space background come up and all the other stuff but anyway put it like this it's working because I've already done this before so and look at the mouse everything is smooth and we are done It's A Wrap later", "GBvfiCdk-jc": "good evening Achmed good evening infidel so you're a terrorist yes I am the terrorist what

welcome to my channel if I haven't already met you then it's really nice to meet you so please don't forget to subscribe please don't forget to give this video a thumbs up and just relax because I think it's gonna get interesting I have my green tea hats on holiday but obviously I have my laptop so let's get to it [Music] he was delightful I mean respect and you know to his vocal like I can't imagine doing something like that visually I was taking back to Lord of the Rings and wait that's already I'm already quite sure that is amazing that [Applause] wait that was a really amazing scream that he did they're like you need oh my goodness that blood on his face what is that is it real two hours later yeah that immense control and range that he has with his voice and he probably has the most amazing chest middle and head voice merging into one sorry I'm Justin Bieber yeah [Applause] very interesting manipulation too it's really quite something seeing somebody being possessed by music and absolutely caught up in it and wrapped up in wrapped up in music and completely taken over like a possession isn't it's like you're you were possessed by music and but could you see his facial expressions and the expression that he is exuding from his being [Applause] those brows are respectively may have gold Oh awful isn't it the Agassi I don't suggest singing like that no I've never seen anything like this it's it's one thing listening to certain vocals that I'm not used to listening to I don't know what they're singing about angry and also it's I'm a different level also in terms of the performance as well and how much they came to this kind of music is so it is amazing because I like to think any genre of music that you are singing if you could literally 100% lend your soul your body and your mind into it it's a very special thing and that connecting to the audience because you're so it's ruled in the music in the words in whatever genre yeah [Applause] looking surfing once I always have like a comma splice [Applause] [Music] what is that right I mean respect for the technical proficiency that you need to be able to maintain or sustain on sort of vocal fry or fry screaming or the the hard glottal attacks that you need to possess that work possesses in my head right now do you not I mean it's it's it's one thing just singing cleanly and it's a very difficult thing to be able to sort of work your vocal folds and the ligaments and the muscles you have to really get the foundations of singing really right prior to that it's doing these kind of exercises and I mean it's not my kind of singing I don't I don't think like that but I can appreciate the vocals dexterity workings of the voice and the very much dominant sorry I'm doing that um you go out thing again on a different childhood thing so yeah I mean amazing kind of scared a little bit I'm not gonna lie to you it's it's quite I was quite wanted by intrigued intimidating yes and I was I was quite intrigued by all yeah thank you thank you for asking me to do this fun it's very sweet of you you beautiful human should I can never stop singing hashtag you're not alone hashtag work on your breath I mean that's work to the basics of singing the foundations of your breath so think lo 360 effect and it's not even just I mean it's the basis for all singing okay obviously differ type of time sometimes you will need a different kind of requirement of breath but that was I'm kind of I'm kind of shivering and I'm kind of shook and I'm kind of I have different emotion it brings up so many different emotions do you have that as well like oh and then I've kind of wanted to cry and then I was a bit like oh and then I like different emotions were washed over the body in a way so love you guys take care", "ekz25RHVlN0": "[Music] guys we got another new toy and this one's reheated oh no what happened this is the armor creighton exp 8s and exp means extreme bash so in this video we're gonna unbox it put it together and then extreme bash it do you have a job you hate imagine if you could make more money from the comfort of your own home that was my dream and it became a reality once i started selling on ebay and i've now taught hundreds of people my secrets so just check out the results here from some of my students so if you're sick of that 90 or 5 and you want to make more money than a doctor from the comfort of your own home then click on the link down below and i'll show you how so for the past few years now the traxxas x-maxx has been the ultimate large-scale rc basher a few companies have tried to take it down but nobody has yet really managed to succeed so the original armor crate and 8 s was a good contender but it still didn't come anywhere near as close to the x-max when it came to durability and we put a whole load of modifications and upgrade onto this truck to try and make it stronger than the x-maxx and now the exp edition comes with a whole load of upgrades out of the box so with a bit of luck it's going to be an absolute tank right out of the box waffle waffle waffle we'll have a look to see what's in there a little bit later [Music] oh guys check it out it looks absolutely epic [Music] and look at the size of it it's a beast so upgrades over the original one what i can see so far is b for your shock shafts which was a big problem on the original one you've done big jumps you used to bend them thicker shafts hopefully solved it we've got front and rear sway bars straight away i can see guys we got a thicker chassis this one has made a 70-75 the original chassis on the first one we bent it on the first ever jump but this one being thicker and made out of 70-75 should hopefully make it bulletproof we have a metal chassis brace now an extreme bash bumper what else we got bigger wheels and a heavy-duty survey saver but you've probably noticed there's no electrics in there and that to me is a good thing because then you can choose what you want to put in there on the original one the electrics were okay but the servo kind of died early on to actually upgrade it the motor was a little bit underwhelming for the size of the truck so we had to upgrade it but in my opinion it's a lot better to get it like this with nothing in it then you can choose what you want to put in there yourself so one massive weak spot that the original one had was a suspension arm and although these ones on the new one look exactly the same hopefully they've used some better plastic that feels lovely oh look i just noticed we got beef your turn buckles as well front and rear so in the box you get all this stuff here and then here's the stuff that you've got to supply yourself so i'm going to be using my dumbo radio max 5 esc 1180 kv tp motor check out the size of this and this 78 kg agf servo guys this servo looks like an absolute beast it's full metal case full metal gears check out the amount of torque it's got and if this is any good in there then i may well put four of them into the laminator guys just check out the thickness of that chassis i really think we're gonna have a tough time bending that five millimeters thick that makes it even thicker than the m2c1 oh i can't wait to try it out all right enough muffler let's get benchy [Music] so the reason we changed the spur gear is to change the gearing we're running quite a fairly low kv motor and lower kv motors have got less rpm but a lot more torque so we need to gear it accordingly and i'm just guessing here so hopefully it's going to be a good guess if not we'll have to change the gearing later man that tp motor's got some compression so next we've got to install the servo so i've just plugged it into the receiver i've set my steering trim to zero and next we've got to install the servo saver this little line here just needs to be slightly off center just like the instructions oh guys we've got a slight problem the thread on this agf servo is something different i've got no idea what it is but the screw that comes with the armor it doesn't thread into there and the next size up is m4 and that doesn't fit and it comes with this little screw here which is the right thread but it's too short we need to screw that long but we do have a power hd servo and the stock armor screw does screw to the top of it so we're gonna have to run with this servo not quite as powerful as that one but i will save this for a different project so i've just soldered up all the motor wires we've just put the connectors on so next we've gotta mount down the esc now m2c do make a plate so we can bolt it in but i haven't got a spare one so on this car we're just gonna stick it down and for that i like to use this stuff here there we go ready to rip the live pros i'm going to be using are these trends here i'm gonna put a link down below we can get the car from the batteries the speed controller the motor and everything else on this build link to all of that lot down below one thing that i do do is i cut this piece here off of the battery straps every time you change your batteries you've got to thread it in and there's a massive pane in the back cut that bit off it just makes it so much easier putting the batteries on all right look see what's in here oh yes needed that new steering arms for the lmt oh that's going to go oh my god carpet's got it again all right let's go out and give it a rip nothing all right here we are on location put a little bit of sugar and drywall tape on the inside oh i got claire in the house got me row in the house where's him hey all right we will see that didn't work oh ian's creighton's looking fresh there we go that's looking cool oh new basketball on there as well oh that's gonna go hey doggy oh she's lively [Applause] that's right i'm filming i'm not being a knob oh no look over there it's an apocalypse oh footage and i saw what it's all right look we've got skid plates oh my god that's mad ah man this has got some power probably not enough to sell fire oh my god what footage get for my cine yay all right ready steady go completely smoked [Music] [Laughter] [Music] do you know what i took off there and it landed no that's where it landed it landed there or was it there [Music] [Music] just oh nice this is a base guys guys i think this has got to be one of my favorite rc's at the moment look at it it goes everywhere oh it stopped what happened footage oh footage maybe it's got too hot let's have a look check out the temperatures so far guys it's a tank oh jesus that motor's hot i think we're over geared we let it cool down and we'll whip it again hey what are you reckoning oh that sounds like it broke how hot the motor is oh guys look just having a quick little inspection over it all rear arm look it's already got a big crack in there so it's probably gonna need some rpm arms [Music] oh takes it oh it's not sounding too healthy oh i think we killed it electric is sounding coggy oh it's done oh no game over it did well we laughed you kept it come on show us called it uh the chassis doesn't look straight anymore the back end oh yeah it's gone up got here yeah here it there and there baby oh my tough baby bash bar time kev it's all your fault you gotta learn how to land it properly i don't know guys i think i landed it pretty good i mean i put every jump in the video overall i am very impressed with it but i think we're gonna need a set of rpm arms and we're gonna have to do something with a chassis so although it is made out of 7075 there are different grades of aluminium someone says it's like t6 and although load of other stuff so maybe they're using like a lesser grade we put a straight edge on there look so we're touching there in the center and look that's how far spent on the back and then coming on the front it's about the same there too so definitely disappointed on the chassis yes we did bash it hard but it is branded extreme bash and i didn't really do any bad landing so i don't know what do you reckon guys is it acceptable or is it not acceptable let me know in the comments is it better than the x-maxx guys it's a completely different weapon i absolutely love this car it is one of my favorite rc cars that i've got now it handles a lot better than the x-maxx when was blasting it around in that bmx track pit i could really run it on the ragged edge and it was very stable the x-max would have fallen over like multiple times but the x-max has got a self-right button and the x-max also can bash a lot harder so it kind of depends what you want i love them both and i say get them both there's going to be a link down below where you can get this car from where you can get like the motor the esc and all that kebab and we're gonna upgrade it and we're gonna fix it and we're gonna bring it out again in another video and give it another extreme bash so subscribe and smash the bell so you don't miss it and we also gotta see why this motor system failed we'll have a look at that in a different video oh look guys one of these light poles died i think that is why the creighton started behaving funny let's try some different live pros on there and hopefully it will be all right but for now i'll see you over on one of these videos here", "q17ER-yee6M": "Y'all are about to\nget your minds blown.

No. Nothing? No. Really all I did\nwas just probably play video games on the\nPS4 and that was it. [LAUGHTER] Yeah. Yeah, this is different. So you just-- what made\nyou start wanting to play? My dad took me to an AC/DC\nconcert 2 and 1/2 years ago, and I was on my Pop's\nshoulders, and I said, I want to do that for\nthe rest of my life. But I really didn't\nstart playing until I was 7 which was like a month after. Oh, you waited a month. Yeah. Yeah, when I was\nseven, my parents didn't take me to AC/DC. So then you start playing\nguitar, and you took lessons? Yeah, I took lessons\nfor about two years. And then my dad\nstarted teaching me. Your dad teaches you. OK, but I heard that\nyou can hear a song and then just start playing it. Yeah. Pretty much. Yeah. Yeah. It takes me like a couple\nof tries to play it. Oh, it takes you\na couple of tries. OK.

will give you an idea probably what I got had this bad boy six years up until both couple weeks ago start letting me down only allows me to charge at about three outs two outs yeah it takes a really long time sixty eight hours an hour batteries is hours that I mean I can go get another 150 bucks but hey why would I want to do that been improved ooh though the last times to which is only 60 watts check this part of the box all right here comes with all the leads everything you need to get this bad boy rocking up okay so as the jst plug the alligator clips the xt60 plug receiver blood to Mira plug deans ec3 ec5 well then you know there's two different ones of those and the balance of large you get two of them apparently it is up to one to six sell my used lipo's so I can charge them up a max of seven amps which most of my batteries will only take five actually recommends five like if you read the back of the Jenni's back he's just probably in that box it actually only shows that you can go to five so I'm going to push your push your stuff unless you're running like 7000 bought batteries that you might want to go this it might be able to see seven so anyways did you oh man let's take a peek inside well it's gonna spring for the quad that's four and yeah it's a little bit crazy probably worth its money but I'm fine with - I used to one for six years never had a brawl I just tried going to stuff in advance basically come on recharge well there it is the charger is a nice upgrade gets a little carry handle cooling must have a built-in fan temperature settings on the back one for each side obviously your power charging needs and your pens obviously your digital charging leads power cord all the beautiful anestine is the only ones that really care about these are tracks this but obviously tracks is just business made by a different company tracks this makes them stuff I'll probably just cut them off and make it deep tracks this one or other games and I put two minutes which both have the ec5 I guess yeah easy Bible so yeah it was fired up Aleppo's let's get this bad boy rocket pretty sure everybody knows how to use one of these they don't leave a comment I could try to help you out you know I've actually got hard where's the money though let's get this big boys school twice thanks bro good luck I'll see you on the trails", "o5X6PIyNutU": "and it's

alright oMG here are some awesome components so current can be measured using an ammeter this must be placed in series [Music] show voltage can be measured using a voltmeter this must be placed in parallel [Music] a variable resistor can be adjusted to alter the resistance in the circuit a de Ord come used what a diode can be used in a circuit to change AC into DC as it only lets current to flow in one direction [Music] now a thermistor will lower the resistance in a circuit as the temperature increases a light dependent resistor LDR will lower the resistance of the circuit as the light intensity increases a fuse will break the circuit when the current gets too high [Music]", "5bKDU_R2f7Q": "[Music] today i'm going to show you how to live stream onto your facebook profile onto your

hawaiian shorts and flip-flops down below guys i want to make something very clear to you right now is that i am only wearing a shirt and tie right now i'm only wearing a shirt and tie right now so just keep that in mind after streaming today no kidding of course you know jim's asking that because normally you guys see me in a t-shirt well today trying a whole different thing you know as a brand we have been looking at like how we present ourselves on camera and this is kind of like a neat thing now i don't think i'm gonna wear this every day but what i like what i like to do is be edgy i like my my look to have a little bit of an edge and we kind of did some analysis as a team here and we thought you know when did our did our when was our show like just really performing and everything was on fire and everything was hot and my wife says you know it was when you were wearing this type of outfit and this type of style and i was like you know let's go back to that i like it i don't know why we stopped doing it uh but let's let's keep going so uh we're changing our look up a little bit jim and we're doing that um as a way to uh to grow the show and to grow our brand so glad you guys are here yeah now that's another thing too let me show you something else costume co is saying sleeves rolled up to show the tats let me tell you something my tats are very important to me because i didn't get any tattoos until i was an adult first tattoo i ever got was my wife's name on my ring finger because i don't necessarily like to wear a a ring a day right so essentially i'm working out i'm like handling video comment you know so yeah that's i want people to see like that's the culture i come from you know is is a little bit i don't know maybe more urban like i'm from long beach folks like you can take the boy out the hood but you can't take the hood out the homeboy you know what i'm saying for air five for that okay so it's 109. it's time to dig into our content today and we have got a great tutorial lined up for you because today i'm going to show you how to live stream onto your facebook profile where you can reach your family and friends i'm going to show you how to live stream onto your facebook business page and i'm going to show you how to live stream into any or all of your facebook groups all at the same time with a strategy called multi-streaming okay now what is multi-streaming well it's just like it sounds kind of right like multi-streaming is the art and science of going live in different places all at the same time now there's lots of ways to do this but i'm going to show you the quickest the fastest the easiest way to do that and before i do i want to say big shout out to stephanie liu who is seriously one of my sisters from another mr she's amazing we're good friends she's an a fantastic live streamer in fact we're writing blogs for our site we're getting into blogging again you know and i'm like stephanie lewis a good blog so i was scoping you out this weekend stephanie it's good to see you on the show and of course my man over at live stream labs saying looks like you should be in the band blink182 yes blink from like 90 the 90s maybe maybe not the newest blink but we'll see i guess the jury is out guys which band should i best belong to in this outfit i'd love to hear from you guys in the comment section below now we are going to be answering your questions today so if you do have questions i want you to go ahead and ask them in the comments section and if you can type the letter q in the comment section so i can see what your questions are and we'll answer them all at the end okay let's dig in to our training today and to do that i'm going to go to a screen share and carlos i think can you put the screen share on there you go okay so i'm going to let carlos kind of control this for a little bit and i'm going to talk about using restream to go live into multiple places at the same time okay so the first thing you want to do is you want to get the free version of restream now i have the full version it's 15 bucks a month it's not a big investment and we get so many clients from our restreaming that it's really just a cost of doing business okay so again you can do this on any like any number of softwares but if you want to do it quickly fast easy get restream okay now here's what restream does is it multi-streams to different platforms all at the same time today we're going to talk about going live in three different facebook avenues but you can actually go live on facebook in your groups you know on your pages and also on twitch and also on youtube and also on linkedin in fact we're live on two uh youtube channels right now so there's really a lot of combinations that you can go to let's talk about your facebook strategy right now what you're going to want to do is click add channel and i want you to know if you mess this up right if you like royally screw this up you'll you'll have lots of opportunities to fix this and i'll and do it right and i'll show you how so you're going to click add channel and then you're going to click facebook live okay after that what you're going to do is you're going to connect your facebook page and this is the step that you're going to do multiple times so the first thing that you're going to do i mean you could do it in any order you know you can add your page and then your group and then your profile whatever whatever you want to do here's what i would recommend though you want to like go live in relevant groups um can you can you believe that you want to go live in relevant groups which means you know if you're in like a you know like a all natural granola weight loss group but but your whole thing is business marketing you know the temptation is to go like oh i'll market to the businesses in that group but that's not what i would do so i would strategically sort of pick the groups that you're going to live streaming now you do have to be an admin okay of these groups but let me tell you there's a great strategy here that you guys i want to kind of share with you here's a strategy start making friends with people in other industries and connect them like let them stream in your group and you stream in their groups okay so this is kind of like baller baller status here okay let's go back to the screen share so you're to pick i think in this group what we'll do in this page we'll we'll start with our personal profile but you can also stream to your public page and you can also stream to any number of groups on which you are an admin so once you choose the group you want to go into you're going to click save okay and that's going to that's going to like complete the deal like you did it you just added a group okay to to your destinations is what they call it so now what you're going to do is you're going to add another channel right and you guys are out there going like but oh and it's not it's a youtube channel not a facebook page and i get it it's a channel they restream to multiple channels your facebook page is one channel your facebook profiles another channel your facebook groups another you know so that's that's what channel means don't don't get it confused with like you know your your uh youtube channel so you're in this page now and you're gonna click add another channel and you'll come back to this remember how i said earlier if you screw up don't worry about it you can always sort of just fix it later well this is what it looks like if you if you mess you could just come right back to this page over and over and over again so notice how it says facebook live at the top now along with all the other platforms that you can go live on and you're going to run through the process again you're going to connect your facebook page this time you'll choose your profile you'll save it and now look in our destinations we now have our group uh excuse me our group and our profile here so what are we gonna do you nailed it right we're gonna add one more channel come right back to facebook live add the page uh you know here and then now we've got you see we've got three different destinations all logged into our restream channel and by simply toggling them on or off and this is really key you can toggle them on or off because there might be times mind you there might be times where you want to go into just facebook live but you want to like dominate facebook live and then there are other times where you might want to add you might want to add um youtube to that or again mind blown here right like partner up with others in your space that have youtube channels even if they're small and go live on their channel and your channel all at the same time right so there's partnership strategies here that you can learn from when you're going live in multiple locations okay let's let's land this plane so that we can get to q a and start talking about some strategy things so now that you've got your channels your three channels all set up here's what you're gonna do next you're gonna click on events and you're gonna schedule a live event click on this button here and then you're gonna choose to schedule a live stream event by the way with restream you can schedule a pre-recorded video to go out as well like how incredible is this okay and then you're gonna create the event with a title a description now the title of the video on facebook ah no one's really gonna see it's the description box that people are going to see the description box is sort of like the captions box on on facebook so like uh when you make a post and then you you you like like you upload a video then you comment you kind of like leave text that's what the description is okay you set your day and your time it might look something like this here here and of course down here you'll set up the day and time for the schedule and then you can even upload a thumbnail image so it helps to have a great looking thumbnail image that you can choose from your computer you can go ahead and crop it you can use a square image to take up more screen space which is largely what i would recommend for facebook and that helps to get more click through on the videos and then you're going to click next which will lead you to this page here where you can choose to toggle on or toggle off the places that you want to live stream to and when you click the blue button at the bottom to create an event you will have a pre-scheduled event now you do have to schedule about an hour into the future so you can't do like uh 10 minutes i'm gonna i'm going to stream in 10 minutes kind of thing right you it's not going to work like that and take a look at these buttons down below here when you click on these buttons down here it will take you to the url okay it will take you to the url of the video so if you want to go to see where the scheduled event is on facebook or is on youtube you can click on these links here notice the number seven guys it means that i am streaming in seven places at one time that's all with the help of restream okay so we've got that and then when you're ready you can enter the live studio where you can customize the look of your broadcast using the built-in studio that region provides you click go live and within on facebook it takes about 10 seconds so within about 10 seconds you will be live on facebook now if you don't have restream if you're using something else or maybe you you're like using obs or you're going live

replay and you wanna now watch something else or go into another tutorial then check the links in the description box below and you can do that what we're gonna do now is answer questions from the live audience about anything that i just covered here today and we're going to answer any questions y'all might have y'all y'all might have any questions you all might have about live streaming growing your business with video in general so oh let's do that now let's so good to see you guys out there today there's times like this where i wish i had a co-host i do i wish i had a co-host or a guest i could ask ask a question to and and just stop talking for a second because it's like imagine i want to do a video of like you know like when you're lifting imagine you can only do this you know so many times folks and my tongue is doing that the entire time that that i'm talking and that's that's part of why i love the game so much all right let's go to our questions for today leelovetv is asking can restream stream to a facebook event that's a great question as far as i can tell no you can stream onto pages profiles and groups now if i'm wrong about that somebody please correct me because i want to make sure we're giving the most up-to-date information that we can now here's the thing though is you want to use facebook events to promote your live stream so i would like to think that you are scheduling you're using the events to get alerts and gather people together but then when you're live streaming you want to share that within the group to get them watching you on your business profile okay because here's the thing long term i want all of you building your business profile all of you like how many of you are streaming more from your profile or more from your page okay now if you're streaming in groups you're streaming i guess you can stream from your business largely it's from your profile okay i'd love to hear i'd love to hear what you're doing so the the question is is that really the best strategy for you and i recommend that you're using the events to gather people to build alerts but because events are like they're temporary and they're hard to reschedule and they're hard to reboot they're hard to re-engage past audiences you want to keep getting that audience to new platforms right and this is like the ascension model of funnels right so first you get them to engage on a video where you maybe drive them to an event and now from the event you drive them to your profile and so on and so forth content upgrades is is is what we call it's a great question lee and we are so pumped that you are joining us today marco vincente is saying is this live or pre-recorded video this brother man is as live as it gets we we're i'm an animal on the live stream and you can be too so glad that you're out there but we are a hundred percent live today in fact i am uh i am drinking the hottest cup of coffee you've ever had i went to costco the other day to buy a new uh mug uh ridiculous because i got these new mugs that actually make your hot coffee ten times hotter than it was when you put it in and i burned my tongue the first drink i took out of this i burned my tongue in the middle of church i'm sitting in church and i'm i like start to ha ha you know and i i was lisping the rest of the day nutristars is asking can i add an instagram account no it is against the instagram terms of service to live stream from a desktop now there is a software called lulatv and lulatv is sort of a workaround here and so what you could do is stream on lula tv uh and be streaming on instagram at the same time that you're using restream and you can even build in this build in the screen share feature to kind of like hack your way around it so there are ways around it and i'll tell you the the tip i just gave you about lulu tv like that's big in fact somebody reach out to lulatv let's do a brand deal somebody somebody calls somebody and that'll that'll get it done so so yeah instagram has very specific rules about live streaming from a desktop great question my girl charlotte ann moore is in the house good to see you talking taxes saying i'm joining uh for the first time on this channel because i'm wanting to learn more about restreams since i have it well today's episode was fantastic if you missed it be sure to mark it in your watch later and watch it again because it's like really the first thing i want you to do right if you were to to like say oh what should i do to grow my live streaming platform i would say first like get really warmed up with facebook because facebook kind of builds your confidence you know and then we want to sort of open you up to youtube and that's where the big that's where the big difference can be made in your in your revenue there so something to think about uh good to see you here talking tax larry kozin my man air five whoop thank you for being with us today and by the way where's teaching with paul where's paul duke today man looking for you buddy uh does streaming to multiple channels split the upload speed fantastic question okay let's talk about that so um let's imagine you're in your house you're in front of your computer and it's a mac it's pc it doesn't matter um and you're gonna go live onto facebook okay just from your desktop that's gonna take somewhere around three uh megabits of upload speed and so the internet service that you have from your provider whether it's xfinity or you know whoever does the internet in your house i don't even know cox communications i have no idea but you have an internet provider you have to make sure that you have at least three megabits uh upload speed otherwise you don't have enough speed to get on the web most home accounts have like 10 um in their basic and i might be staying around but it's like 10 mbps or something like megabits per second something like that now i have 30. okay and the reason being because if i decide to live stream it's taking three but if my kids are are uploading dropbox images or uploading or my wife could be uploading video for the video marketing school right that's also taking upload speed similarly in a live stream on facebook from my computer onto youtube it's three megabits per second for facebook and four for youtube so now i need seven if i have only 10 and somebody else is using the internet then i could have disrupted service or i could have a bad stream like there there's a number of things that could happen it could lag okay so the question is you know with restream like oh and you're you're restreaming like seven different channels here like you know what is that doing to your internet that's a great great great question here's the thing with restream their technology takes care of all of it so you don't need to have an advanced internet service provider to get the benefits of restream it was the very first question i asked them i was like how do you guys do this how do you do it okay because there's a lot of software's that can live stream here or there but to be able to livestream at least like 250 250 locations at one time is amazing and that's why i love the software okay so no when you're with uh restream what happens is your three megabytes megabits goes to restream and then restream has the technology to spread it on the web and then that's what that's kind of what your monthly uh your monthly membership pays for is keeping those pipelines open but they have a free version as well and you can get started for free and stream in just a couple places at one time you know which i think is a good way to get started and if you want to get started that way we are having a giveaway this month if you just joined us so if you get started with a free trial at restream by going to openvideo.com restream get a free version of restream uh then you'll be entered to win a full uh a full pro account and that's that's pretty uh amazing okay next question christopher bovin is a member of the video marketing school my private training program for business owners and entrepreneurs looking to leverage youtube and live video and chris is asking oh and can you invite a guest who's in the audience by sending him a link absolutely with restream there's a handful of buttons right down below me right now and one of them is a little like it's a symbol of a person and a plus sign next to them so they add a person to your stream when you click that it gives you a link and then you can give that link to anybody and that person can now join you on your restream show and you can have up to like four guests i think i think you can have even more on restream but you can have a handful of guests on restream you can also have guests coming in and out of restream and i think that that's pretty pretty fantastic too okay so that's something to uh to think about there i want to give a big shout out to ahmed who is giving us a super chat 10 us dollars flop he says owen so glad you're live i was approached by a sponsor but i read that youtube won't allow burned ads in my video so how do other people do that great great great question now what is a burned ad a burned ad means uh it's in the the video file that you upload to youtube okay so so you you do a commercial for a sponsor you put it in your video and then you upload that that one file to to youtube and uh the the thing is is i read that youtube won't allow that that's that's actually not the case okay so what you're talking about here is a sponsored video so in a sponsored video you can have a a promote a company uh be promoted by you in that video and we've added um small commercials into our videos you know film riot is a channel on youtube that does this extremely well so go look at film riot's channel and they're i mean they're thriving they're hundreds of thousands not millions of subscribers i mean they do extremely well now the trick is is that when you upload it it's like doing taxes you have to sort of declare that this is a sponsored video somebody else already sort of paid for this video and if you think about it it's extremely fair because what youtube is trying to avoid is they don't they don't want one of their advertisers right somebody paying youtube to advertise in front of your video if that video is already spoken for right if somebody else is already advertising in that video so you do need to declare that that that video already has an ad in it and you do this when you upload it it asks you very specifically and then once you've done that uh you can upload the video as normal they will not run ads in it you will not monetize it um in the same way shape or form great question thanks so much teacher paul hard-boiled english my man look at the second shot i wanted to show you i look me and teacher paul are buds uh we we've been you know you've been what we've been hanging out together for a long time as live streamers business we've never met in person which i think is amazing but i wanted to show you my new like second shot here and you can see my little my little x keys right here by the way guys if i made videos about how to do like my whole setup you know would you watch them i'd love to know because i'd love to make them but if you're not gonna watch them i you know i want to make videos you're going to watch people watch my videos though you know but i want like what are you guys looking for i can show you how to use all this stuff great we got another question coming in from reagan v films yes my man good to see you with a fake sponsor do we have to market as sponsored oh my gosh great question what's a fake sponsor so in my program the video marketing school of which reagan v is a member in my program then i teach what's called a fake sponsor and it's really like a it's a goofy term what it means is that in your videos you're saying something like hey welcome to the show our show today is brought to you by my email marketing company you know get a free trial of my email marketing company you know today and you can put that link in the description box below okay and what this is designed to do is to um get traffic over to affiliate links that you own right so that you could be monetizing your channel or making money with your youtube videos we do the same thing if you like if you made a video about headphones or microphones and then you you wanted to do something like hey i put i put amazon links to these products in the description box below um so you so that you're making money on amazon's amazon affiliates that's also a powerful thing to do it's kind of like a fake sponsor okay but do you have to mark the video as sponsored no absolutely not and here's why because no one paid for that video and that's key this it's called a fake sponsor in my group right but in real life it's not really called anything it's just called affiliate marketing but if we called it affiliate marketing no one would join you know what i mean so yes that video space is not spoken for you have links in the description box that can lead to purchases there's nothing wrong with that there's nothing wrong with it in fact we don't say this show is sponsored by we say this show is made possible by or this show is is brought to you by okay we use very specific language to uh to annotate that this video has not been sponsored or paid for okay great great great question and you know we got a lot of a lot of you guys commenting that yes you should market that is incorrect you should not market as sponsored look your goal is to make money on youtube you know and and you got to know the rules remember the word fake sponsor is a word that our company uses it's like big mac right it's like big mac is is a meaningless word outside of mcdonald's you know what i'm saying like it's a name for their hamburger i'm booga who guys who knows what that movie is i've never even seen that movie i've just seen that meme so think about that remember because like if you're in my programs you're gonna learn like keywords and or you know branded words and and and hook points uh that um i help you understand a concept but in in the real world it's affiliate marketing is what we're doing so i'm glad that we could have this conversation another question coming in from gabriel taylor is streaming from restream smoother than obs cpu overload and obs you know i'm really glad you asked that question because i love obs i got my start on obs i still have obs installed on my computer but i use restream because it gives me a smoother more reliable more in sync stream than anything else that i have ever used ever and i have live stream what how many of you guys know about my life i mean you guys even know like how many live streams i've done i mean hundreds hundreds since like the last five years since meerkat you know we have tried it all we used to use obs to like share our screen where i was streaming onto instagram and then broadcasting all of that onto facebook and youtube and cpu overload's a real thing i remember we did a whole episode where the whole episode was putting so much you know information through the the bandwidth that it we had to like cancel the show like it didn't work it was just too much so it's a real question and yes restream is a software or like hardware it's i mean it's it's a thing you log into so you don't download anything on your computer for restream and because of that you have a much higher quality vehicle and they have they have a whole team of customer agents that are like and developers that are working on this all the time so so yes i i would i would switch and i think you're gonna love it i really do can you customize and do everything that that obs can do not a hundred percent you can do some of the things for sure but you can also integrate obs you could use your obs verbal cam i'm using a virtual cam right now to switch back and forth i'm not using obs but it's like obs same thing obs can do this and we can do a lot of other things so i would actually encourage you to look at an obs restream combo and if you want to know more about that then let me know in the comments and guys and i will make these videos for my channel like i would enjoy this stuff okay next question great we have another question about restream versus stream yard and i feel like it's a hard question to answer because i am sponsored by and i am firmly in the camp of restream that being said that hasn't always been the case to be with another live streaming soccer company that also offers a great service and when restream approached me and showed me what they were working on i made a decision to switch to restream now i've used restream and i use restream as a guest on other people's shows so like i'm a recurring guest on other people's shows and i'm used to using the restream software to do that or the stream yard software to do that so what is my professional opinion restream is the best software for live streaming on the web it's the best it's the best studio it has the best features it re-streams to the most platforms the analytics are the most robust okay there's there's just so much like as soon as i hang up on this stream i'm gonna get an analytics report that goes so wide and so deep on who was watching for how long on what platforms it's an incredible platform okay so i love that now is stream yard bad no i think streamyard does a fine job some things that i i think are are big differentiators as a guest i can't respond to the comments you know i left a lot like even if i log in and do all this stuff i mean it it's a hassle it can only restream to a couple platforms at one time you do not have the studio options uh the scheduling options or the uploading options of restream so you know restream is a more powerful service is that me saying you know i hate all the other services no i'm proud of them and i think that there's room for everybody to thrive if you want to thrive fast powerfully get restream you can get a free trial today at owenvideo.com restream and if you get your free version you'll be entered into a drawing to get a free pro version so that's really exciting okay next question uh dragon fruit is saying owen can you get the verificate youtube even if a channel is not in the ypp but has a hundred thousand subs you know that's a great question i don't even know that that youtube does verification marks anymore largely i think that they're working with the gold button and the silver button standard so i would i would look into that that's a great question maybe you could google it for us but i certainly this certainly no one in my circles is talking about youtube verification so maybe i missed it i'm open to that i'm i'm at my root of broken hollow man with limited knowledge on the universe but uh but uh i i don't know anybody talking about the verification mark on youtube so help me out with that dragon fruit good to see you here by the way glad that you're with us today okay next question reagan v films is saying off topic no such thing my friend how can i get more gen millennials on my channel about tech while maintaining gen z using the youtube formula book by daryl about demographics okay look so your your channel this is a question by the way about audience development and this is not off topic in fact it's really the first and only conversation we should be having i i don't i think this is like the first question about audience we ever got on this show and that's i think it's important i want to encourage you guys to be asking more questions about developing audience and who it is so here's the thing your channel is about tech and so your audience therefore is people interested in tech that's it whether that's gen that's millennials or z okay those are what i would call silos what daryl calls buckets okay those are like silos inside your channel and a silo is like a playlist okay it's a group of videos all on a similar topic and by the way we teach this in depth in the video marketing school and what you want to do then is if you're targeting millennials you're going to want to make a series of videos that that use the language of millennials about or you're going to be about tech but titled and described in the language of millennials okay the same with gen z or maybe you'll do a series of of tech that's more going to be googled by gen z so here's a good example you know early on in my channel's existence i was doing doing lots of tutorials on like web design and how to add into your web and funnels and and all of these things but i wanted to get a younger crowd and so what i did was i went ahead and made a video about snapchat because i knew that it would bring in the right people to my channel and those channels those videos blew up by the way they blew up and what i did was i was able to bring in a whole new demographic of viewer into the channel still interested in video marketing but in a different age group which expands the network so that's what i want you thinking about reagan v is like i'm gonna make you say i'm gonna make videos for millennials and and here's five examples and then i'm gonna make videos for uh gen z and here's what those look like okay and then even inside those silos you could have multiple silos like you say okay for millennials i'm gonna do this software this social media and that headphone and then for gen z it's gonna be like i'm gonna do this software that app and and this um i don't know pokemon thing i have no idea like what i don't know if you're gen z like what what what tech are you into i'd love to know because i'm way into amazon alexa tech and smart home tech i have a whole channel on it great question oh my gosh question of the day if i had you know an award prize to give out for the best questions ever it would be this question right here shannon broadbent is saying i want to get started where do i begin i think that is a great great great question and the first place to begin is the video marketing school before you start live streaming you need to develop your show and that includes who is your show for what is your show about and what is it not about one of the biggest problems i see with brand new live streamers is they make these live stream shows on topics that they should not be talking about they're off topic topics and that's a problem when you work in the video marketing school we have a program called launch your live it's a series of pre-recorded on-demand videos that you can watch at any time from your desktop or your mobile device with templates and guides that go along with it if you want to know more you can go to our website at thevideomarketingschool.com or i will shortcut you shannon if you want us to do a youtube strategy audit for you then i want you to send an email to info thevideospot.net do it right now info thevideospot.net that will go to my wife teresa who is sitting right here listening to me and we'll do a live stream audit for you and will will help you get started on the right path okay but what you want to do we'll do that for free that's not a charge then we'll do that for free right now today okay so if you want to get started with live streaming and you should folks you need to have sort of like your goals in mind what is your goal now it might be different on different shows right like for this show it's it's really different every single week sometimes we want to have a big viewership show right we have our best viewership when we invite guests on the show there's other times where our our real goal is to drive traffic to the restream affiliate link that's our goal today because we just started this new contest okay so is that like i don't know i don't want to sound slimy when i say stuff like that but i hope i'm like letting you guys into the behind the scenes like today it's like okay we want to get people to restream channel today that's like our big goal for today's show so you know what now here's another thing i'll give you another goal here's another goal our goal today was to create the screen shares for a future video we're gonna do on youtube so it's like well let's let's go ahead and get the screen shares ready for restream and then later in the week we'll use them on youtube in a shorter pre-recorded video you see how that works so shannon it's a great question you know if you are fired up and you just want to go live today then get restream go live on your facebook profile go live on your group okay and and no it's thevideospot.net and use restream to do that you can get a free trial owenvideo.com restream um the email is info thevideospot.net pam is logging in pam good to see you owen has a tie on should we be dressed for this no as i mentioned before the only thing i'm wearing is a certain tie and i hope that that doesn't disturb you ahmed is saying thanks a lot for the sponsorship question uh two quick follow-ups if i don't monetize it what's in it for youtube to promote it will i lose viewers second question am i responsible for the comp services i'm not sure what comp services means but let's go to your quick question that kind of goes back to this rumor of like if if i don't monetize a video will youtube promote it um no because youtube is going to promote every video youtube is going to run ads on your video whether you're monetized or not okay except except if you if you put that it's it's monetized so that's a new policy that's changed recently right before it was uh we got to choose which which at which videos were advertised on now it's kind of like no now it changes a little bit when i guess i need to know the size of your channel because it changes a little bit when you're when you are monetized but this idea that youtube won't share your video if you don't monetize it not it's not the case at all youtube wants users on the platform okay because users using the video users watching videos on the platform equates to them to watch time and engagement that they can sell to advertisers similarly you know your videos are going to lead your unmonetized videos are going to lead viewers to monetized videos so i think that youtube's possession is like position is like why would you do that you know what i mean like keep uploading the video they they want they want your videos published to the platform and they want people watching them even if they're not you know even if they're not monetized um so something to think about talking taxes saying obviously i stream about taxes that was my hunch too i started with zero and in a month and a half grew to 102 subs how does that happen well it means that you're targeting the right topics you know that's that's what's happening is you're targeting topics that people are interested in now what else do you have working for you well what time of year is it right now right it's tax season so you have you have like seasonal relevance in you know working on your behalf right now so sort of the hardest thing to do and i i i i've probably approached or been approached by multiple tax people never has a tax person ever like hired me for consulting and and here's why it's it's it's the you are the business thing and i'm not insulting tax people i'm saying you have to get off this hamster wheel right is because they come to tax season and then they get busy because it's tax season and then after tax season they're like i need a break from tax season okay so here's the thing if you talking tax wanna surpass your competition cause i've worked with your competition and they're right now they're they're getting ready for tax season if you can make videos during this season and continue to work your client base you're going to crush you're going to absolutely crush because p this is when people are searching you know guess what people aren't really searching for tax questions after tax season's over you know so that's kind of one of the things you got to do it's kind of like when i'm in a conference you want to post about the conference because everyone's talking about the conference and it's very easy to get into that place where you're like i'm too busy to post about the conference i'm too busy at the conference to post about me being at the conference you got to find a way to do it great question i love it uh pam is saying hey harley harley good to see you i seriously need staff to tell me what day it is totally totally shannon glad you're here i hope you tune in every single week make sure to find us on youtube at owen video and join the community pam is saying yeah i just realized that this is tax time so i rushed out a video about sorting finances out hey great great point here folks like you know even if you're not a tax consultant right even if you're not a tax consultant you could be making videos that help your clients or audience members get ready for tax season right right so like if you're doing videos about designing for b2b and you want to attract small business owners like we do you can say like how to how to get your taxes ready how live streamers can get their taxes ready you know what i mean that that sort of that sort of thing reagan v is saying you guys got to see this reagan v is saying uh i'll worry about taxes in the next two to three years and that's because um he's still in high school and i just think it's it's awesome that we have um you know the the next generation logging into the show and being a part of the revolution the real evolution glad to have you here my friend okay we got time for a couple more do we have any other questions out there while carlos is looking i want to say what's up to life on youtube and facebook it is great to see you and we've got talking tags costume co so many good people larry kozen out there uh ahmed is out there pam love to see you guys here today lead with jim of course is crushing shannon's asking about expanding viewership well the first thing i do is i would stream live on to multiple places at one time i would stream live to multiple and if you're not look if you're not get if you're doing that and you're only getting you know a couple views because you then you need to build those platforms right that's the problem is you're not building the platform it's kind of like well i keep streaming in my group but i don't add any more people to my group you know what i mean how do you add people to you know keller coleman logging in my man um you know so look expanding viewership guys go it's like a multi-facet it's not one way there's multiple ways to grow your strategy and all of them i think kind of fall into i i hate to say that common sense but like common courtesy really is the thing you know in fact like if if you don't have enough people engaging on your profile then you need to get on your profile and go and engage with more people right i struggle with this too we like i i think we're streaming on linkedin today i haven't seen one comment from linkedin today i haven't seen any maybe they came in but why i could easily be like how do i expand my viewership on linkedin or i could go to linkedin and start meeting more people on linkedin right and even and even inviting them to my show and that's the thing is i think we get stuck in this place where when you're like networking with people it's always like well how do i sell this person if i if i have to do anything i want to sell them i i don't want to if i have to choose between getting them on my show or getting them as my customer i want to choose getting them as a customer so i don't want to waste this opportunity no it's the wrong attitude you got to be thinking in funnels right you got to be thinking in like okay what's the next step to keep this person close to me so you know when i eventually spend more time on linkedin and i see it on my phone i put it on the home screen of my phone and i still can't bring myself because you know why i feel like it's it's kind of like um like a business meeting on linkedin i do i feel like it's a zoom meeting and it's like uh i just want to have fun i want to like do this i want to do tick-tock videos and all the things that i want to do got to get over it because i do want to get into that business crowd more on linkedin so so here's the thing i got to just go on linkedin and get them to watch the show every week right and get them like you guys see the compliments people love this show so i got to get people to like the show more you know and then when that happens you know we you know now i'm engaging with them every week then from the show i move them over to a landing page where i have the email i can engage them in email so it's all funnels guys it's all funnels and if you want to build your viewership um then be a part of someone else's viewerships right like be be someone else's viewer if you want more viewers be many other people's viewers go in look at their show leave comments go to their youtube page leave comments go go to the place where they go to the place where they want viewership and be a part of their community there you'll find that it's growing quickly ahmed is saying you have private consultancy chef sessions i have a few more questions regarding sponsorships but don't want to annoy anybody yes i am a sponsorship expert why don't you give me give us an email at info thevideospot.net you'll speak with teresa and um she'll set up a time for us to chat a little bit more let me know what your questions are we do have a consultancy program and you will get you know fascinating results you know we've got um we've got a success story where um our training helped a a local business close a six-figure brand deal a six-figure sponsorship that included live streaming and travel and all sorts of really really great stuff okay i think we've got time for like one more okay lead with jim is saying how do you get linkedin to approve you to live stream yeah good luck pal look here's one thing about linkedin is that they they don't really have their their stuff together when it comes to approving people for the linkedin it is largely an unscientific subjective um sort of bureaucratic process right now and that's almost what the linkedin newsfeed feels like at times doesn't it like can we like lighten up here a little bit but look i'm not anti-linkedin so i i don't mean to be knocking them i just don't think they have the system down yet you know what i mean so here's how i got approved for linkedin i applied every single month for like multiple months and and then i added linkedin to restream when i got set up with restream and i went live and it worked on linkedin i never got an email saying that you're in i never got like an alert saying congratulations or a notification that was like you are now a linkedin live streamer i got nothing teacher paul is saying i applied to linkedin dude not only did i apply i actually was private emailed with one of their partners so linkedin live has partners i know i'm very close one of those partners he wrote me a cc'd personal email to the right person and was like hey meet my buddy owen you got to approve this guy no email back a few months later i was approved like jim i would say keep applying and keep trying to add them to restream because if you get approved they're not going to it's not like they're going to tell you you're just going to they're just going to turn it on jim is saying it's a hot mess you know maybe um maybe that's the case oh what's going on there i clicked the wrong one i hate when that happens i go to click a comment the wrong one it's a hot mess um you know is it a hot mess is it just like because i don't want to knock them is it a mess or is it like they're like a badly organized system is the way i i i think of it um is definitely the case charlotte is saying it's it sounds like a velvet rope at the club it seriously is and like at least at the club the right people can get you in like i i don't even know like what like how how to to to get to get in there but keep trying um uh keep trying and then carlos if you could put that email in the descript in the chat room for ahmed one more time adam's exploits great to see you glad you're here guys that's all the time we have for today thanks so much for joining us on stream like you mean it and be sure to join us next week where we will cover even more live streaming strategies to help you grow your business thanks for joining me today guys i will see you next", "SaT9NgiAsDA": "oh yeah [Music] ladies and gentlemen michael palmisano here again and uh thank you so much for all of the kind words from that uh last video you know who you are he wrote me thoughtful emails thoughtful messages i tried to reply to as many as i could thank you so very much so today i'm on my website trying to do a react request uh from one of you that's a subscriber and i'm going down here and the one that catches my eye today is walk this way funky r b version and this is uh scary pockets walk this way aerosmith cover featuring judith hill this is from brian k meehan and he doesn't say anything he just drops the link all right all right let's do it i've been a scan of a fan of scary pockets for a while i've seen a bunch of their videos let's do it [Music] whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa is that my boy awesome osnoid with the nasa shirt [Music] a really young leader all the time could [Music] reminisce [Music] see [Music] just don't [Music] [Music] and he says oh my god uh okay so many things going on in here first uh dig the vibe dig the vibe she has that sultry thing going perfect rearrangement of this tune um that's why i clicked on it i i i wanted to see i wanted to see a funk version of walk this way so what are they doing in here uh super spread out arrangement in d so you got d7 sharp nine is your basic vibe that right that's your thing then when it goes to the that's in e which is where it is uh in the normal tune in the regular walk this way uh it does this [Music] something like that right you're walking from the four through the flat five to the five right of e so d d sharp [Music] sorry a b flat b of e it does a little pull a little tug off that flat three if i remember correctly but then it goes to the g after that now in the original version the verse is in c so [Music] right and then [Music] goes to a there so they rearrange it so it's d d7 sharp 9 you still go to the e so up to the 2 you could say to do that this little lick but then it goes to the 4 to g g7 so it's a total rearrangement and it works man [Music] [Music] the keyboard player forgive me i don't know his name has always been my favorite part of this band the the joy with which he plays it's just oh man is it infectious [Music] up [Music] who was ready to play that part is so sick her phrasing is so good uh your melody comes from d minor right or your relative f major if you will so it comes out with just minor third and root right [Music] [Music] oh man she does it so well who was ready to play all right facebook [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] oh yeah and then they're all standing all right no we got to go back we got to get some of this os noi what are we doing which we got here so he's walking up from d minor pentatonic and then he goes so again root flat three four five flat seven root flat three four bend the four and then get a petal steel grab the c the flat seven with your pinky [Music] he's got the bar i don't have it just shake it right flat three one [Music] um does he do that i think he's doing this four flat three one but going to the four from here and then grabbing the flat through there in one [Music] flat seven to the one root flat three flat seven to the one [Applause] [Music] one of those hendrix things [Applause] [Music] no i've never been good at those [Music] so it's like you bend up the second string and roll over and pull down the third string [Applause] yeah i'm sorry i'm just not good at that [Applause] right and then back into this that d minor uh pattern four kind of box but that that just never been good at that you just you bend up roll over the third string hit the third thing bring it down little easy top what you're doing here these are dyads double stops if you will this is on the fifth and flat seven of d so a and c respectively with the third and second finger so this gives you the sound of d7 push up two frets and now you're playing the major sixth and the root of d respectively but again when we go over the four chord here right remember this this whole vamp goes four one four one g to d right uh this is now the major third and the fifth of g right right so it's d7 to g and then back up to d minor this is now your root and minor third d and f again loves sussing out that four same we did all this that that that four flat three one same thing four flat three one in d [Music] yeah root to the nine [Music] yeah so it's some miles noise stuff in here man but basically you're you're banging the root through the minor third four go to the fifth and then it does this so like fifth flat seven five four three and then so flat three one and then again bending the root to that nine real tasty super os annoying so that's not what he's doing these are unison bends so he's bending d to e right still the nine and then going up in key i imagine in d minor [Music] is you got f sharp there or g yeah dude it's d f sharp g hello you with me you with me that for the first time in our whole little thing here we have an f sharp right now that works again d seven sharp nine we have a major third f sharp and a minor third f you guys know that the higher taunt the higher note always wins if you have major and minor sounds in both it's the major which creates the tonality right and it's the minor which kind of creates that bluesy flavor so when you do this at the end of the solo it immediately brightens up and i guarantee that's when that piano player and it's just a chromatic walk up back up all the way to that d he knows he knows he goes boy did you just f-sharp me in there yeah and on the five there with the hits you know at the a7 [Music] man uh scary pockets great uh obviously iconic tune judith hill crushes it osnoy crushed it who who sent me this again brian meehan brian amazing thank you so much for recommending this um again slow kind of funk spread out arrangement you know no one's on anybody's toes in there everybody's leaving tons of space simple changes you got d7 sharp nine is your basic tonality uh then it's one to the four to g seven in there your little riff is in e just like the you know the mother song if you will the way aerosmith did it and then it goes to g so they move those around right that's not how it is in the way aerosmith does it so super cool arrangement uh all your melodies stem from d minor um oz is solo coming out of the end you know hitting that unison bend on f sharp like just like a bright beacon coming through uh um so many tasty things in here the the actual videography the way it sounds scary pockets always does a great job you guys are fantastic and that's it dude super fun way to start the day here thank you guys for

are we at so currently bitcoin is at 59 700 having a hit near 62 000 in fact it may have wicked to 62 000 now it has gone it went over this resistance mark to power to new heights and it has since gone down now one of the reasons why i think this may be is because this has happened over the weekend now if we go to the um cme cme futures essentially there is what is known as a cme gap which is essentially a gap between end of trading friday and beginning of trading monday there is a gap typically that gap gets filled sometimes it gets filled immediately sometimes it takes a few days and let me just show you an instance of that so this was last week's gap and it got filled if it got filled pretty much same day got filled on either monday or tuesday where the price went down it failed it and then boom what happened after absolutely soared then the week before there was a tiny little gap here and then the price shot up monday morning and then it went down literally next day then there's another one here once it gets closed it does go up quite nicely not all the time but ultimately what we can gather from this is that whenever there is a gap it does eventually get filled so there was a gap here and then when i when the um future's open monday morning the prices soared again but then it took a few days but it did eventually wick below and filled the gap so what i imagine is that the gap essentially closed on friday at 57 000 before the big rush so it won't surprise me and i have drawn the support line here that if that should happen it should go it should go through a the all-time high support be the um broadening ascending wedge support and then hit possibly a bottom at 57 but whether it does or not i am incredibly like incredibly bullish about the future right i think that um this is going to be a hell of a ride rest of this year um most of this year i should imagine for bitcoin and altcoins so first of all let's have a look and see we're going to 62k actually got us on the sentiment check so as i've told you having gone down recently to 45 000 it brought the sentiment right down now we are able to hit near 60k 65k and actually be still well below euphoria stage so currently as it stands i don't know if you can see currently as it stands when we hit 61.2 we are at 73.7 okay so i think that that would roughly kick in about 70. so i do imagine there's going to be more sentiment cooldowns over time but what i will say though is that despite the increased attention and and value of bitcoin is that all coin season is still in full scale it's still it's the party's still going on so earlier today when i was looking when bitcoin was still about 60 000 and a half um let me just make sure you can actually hear me can you imagine if you could yeah you can hear me right fantastic and by the way i will get to your super chats people i will get to your super chat right anyway so it was 59 this morning when i was above 60. now that it's gone down below 60 it's now 61 on the altcoin season index so i think that like has happened very recently every time bitcoin goes up hits new high basically all coins then hit new highs right so you want to be involved you want to be in the money when bitcoin is hitting new highs you need to be getting there you need to be getting there before the next wave right now just looking at the f2 pool this has been the source of worry in um the cryptocurrency market of late are these guys dumping now you see you will see the larger outflows of the f2 pool which essentially means these are these are miners chinese miners a mining group essentially that are mining bitcoin and an incredible rate they have been selling um they've been selling when the prices have been going up now they have calmed down in recent times so you can see the cell activity has massively reduced and i think the reason why it's just literally because they're making way for this next move we went way below euphoria so they have now they haven't so now they're just letting i think they're probably gonna let the price price skyrocket for now so no real uh no real emergencies on that front so let's have a look and see what's doing well first of all before i get to a your super chats and b on to some of the incredible whale investor groups this is golden people and by the way if you want to be able to know who the whales have invested in other than watching this video is you need to take either my newest d5 course link is in the description um and also or my um bible course the cryptocurrency investment 2021 fund your retirement course both on udemy like they are both in those group the the um way to be able to find out is in those groups so we've got decentral and flipping hell 188 last seven days 40 hashgraph well i don't say i never don't say superman never gave you prior warning i've given you two years of warning about hashgraph now they are beginning to search and they are going towards that top 10. i'm telling her i'm telling it this is sugar then we got harmony 70 27 um terra 24 tara is pretty much on every single whale investors list every single one hollow chain theta hollow number 81 now i'm not selling that yet theta engine file coin right now let let us go to the market the low caps the micro caps team suppose micro caps and you will know i have you will find out from from what i'm going to uncover here that a lot of the coins that are in my micro cap list have actually been obtained through seeing where the smart money is going right so not only do they have to be fundamentally or you know decent relevant popular um and following a current narrative but they've also got to have a little bit of whale invest yeah a good whale investor in it for me to have confidence to go into a micro cap because micro caps where huge risk lies right they can pump dramatically and they can dump dramatically you want to be getting into them um into ones that have potential longevity right i remember because i've been around four years i invested in some of the best cryptocurrencies that exist today cardano binance coin and a load of others that are now in the top 30 that were once upon a time micro caps okay finance i remember bringing to you at 70 cents 72 cents or something right so on my previous channel um so you know you can strike it rich but some of them are coins some of them are seasonal pumps they are not necessarily long-term pumps they're not going to necessarily become anything in the long term anyway let's have a look so paint coin what have i told what did i tell you about paint coin now this is pretty much 8x since i first brought this to you 71 in just the last 24 hours 248 in the last seven days defy wizard this is whale invested sift chain this is whale invested now over one power get in get can i get an amen nah anyway 36 82 in the last week z decks nice big because it went down quite a lot digicol 81 cents people this is 8x2 chain guardians this was much more yesterday ac dc token or should i say ac acxt i'm your pressure so this is now uh one dollar this was 60 cents 69 cents i remember bringing it to you the other day this is whale invested two butterfly protocol dior that's doing well as well decentralized oracles essentially um and yeah and then the rest of them are relatively moderate pumps so let's take a few um what's it called let's take a few super chats and then i'm going to show you the greatness this is this is um this is confirmed these are confirmed whale invested coins okay confirmed all right this means that the people with huge amounts of money in the pursuit of getting richer because the rich get richer people understand that the rich get richer so you want to get rich as they get richer get it so these are confirmed whale investors that have gotten into small crypto currencies and also some big ones we're going to ignore those ones right anyway so let me just talk let me just take have a look through some of these super chats then so first super chat is kudos so kudos let's have a lucky work i remember looking at qdos before not being altogether impressed but does it matter whether i'm impressed or not necessarily because months on despite it having a dog looking website it's still getting two million and this has been out like three months no two months now and it's getting still maintaining two million um it is roughly eight to one i would say ratio of market cap to current volume so it's doing quite well so let's have a look so layer two oracle which i didn't get from this is this is basically a uh decentralized cloud from what i understand um so i didn't get the oracle aspect at all they uh they link the kudos network links the blockchain world to the exclusive kudo platform through a a layer 2 oracle reducing the cost blah blah blah um let me have a look so strategic backers don't know who these guys are coin division coin vision um coinbase moon whale partners algorand ultra ultra what's this oh ultra dot io okay we'll go back to that ultra let's make sure i put that one down so block sync oh gather that's another one i wanted to look at gather um aha right gpv moon rock yeah well i suppose so then but it's 18 now isn't it what is it so despite having a dog website it's 18 million market cap so apparently layer two oracle decentralized cloud so it's a little bit like a cache a little bit like crust but it is aetherium based so anyway yeah so it seems okay actually seems okay happy is so undervalued at the moment yes it is let's have a look at happy cause i'm happy to uh there we are happy happy is undervalued i am patient i don't care i don't care believe me like this is gonna exceed all time highs very soon but it needs that little it has a spike calm down and then it's gonna soar again okay this is gonna be huge in my personal opinion okay so this is just accumulation time i'm not worried not at all worried um and this is essentially a chain link killer people my words um thank you very much lindsay for your kind words regarding my mother hive hive right now hive i know has got venture capitalists i know it because i have seen it in my list so 3.5 mil and it's basically the volume actually exceeds the market cap so this could be 253 gain and it's not really gone up hugely this is new look this is new it has been one cent which puts this uh well 15x less but i imagine that people who had real early faith are the ones that are really profiting at the moment on that but that doesn't mean this may not still have a long way to go so let's have a look and see what this is hr hiring is broken we are not touching that with a 10 foot barge pot or 10 foot pole apparently we're building it from scratch hive is a defect centric autonomous ecosystem built on top of a multi-billion workforce industry where's hive community governed ecosystem that solves the current problems in the global multi-billion freelance and workforce market leveraging a pair of decentralized technologies while adding new features and mechanics that are non-existent on any platform um fee sharing yada yada agents getting reward for so this is basically an infrastructure for recruitment recruitment people hr human resources recruitment agents getting rewarded for finding candidates this is a protocol i imagine that they can bolt onto offers allowing you to sell service packages nine to five jobs bringing recruitment agencies to 21st century the opportunity worldwide research and advisory company guard gartner assess that with current platforms not yet that with current assess that with current platforms not yet ready for the imminent change people starting to work independently will need platforms with functionality lacking in current solutions unspecialized employees bias disputes centralized governance primary models so this is potentially the recruitment agency of the future right or the recruitment protocol of the future high fees industry average fee is 25 if you're taking a job or tasking hive tokens the fee is zero so this is basically like like so what i'm kind of getting initially is that this is like a bit of a uber for recruitment agencies so that finds you jobs or it finds if you're paying for a job or task so it's yeah so it's like connecting employers within is connecting employers with potential employees without a fee attached to it so the agency i imagine data leaks protected i imagine slow settlements currently for freelancers having to wait weeks to withdraw their earnings on hive our own funds our your own funds as soon as a pro job or task finishes no waiting times your own funds as soon as the job finishes right okay bad grammar but no complicated processes oh amazing global outreach not just like a local reach it does actually sound great does actually sound really good now do they have so the token lies at the epicenter erc 777 asset that is backwards compatible with the arc20 with governance staking functionalities our partners i've never heard of any of them right okay so we can't see on here whether they have got a venture capitalists so they're making it difficult for people to find out hence why people probably haven't bought this so let's have a look and see who is in this because it does actually sound quite good it's not it's not a trend it's kind of a trending narrative because i think they've got some d5 aspects to it defy centric autonomous ecosystem they seem to have only one i think that was the investor i saw and that was vendetta so if we just have a look and see who vendetta this is this is to give you an element of i suppose confidence that vendetta are not a venture capitalist okay so let's just have a look and see who vendetta have actually invested in and this will lead you to be able to make your assumptions if you can trust vendetta so let's go and find them and as you can see when i was putting together my list of whale investors like vendetta's third so that shows that i kind of respect them so scale has done really well lately polka starter very good woo trade has really um has really flourished lately alliance block bridge mutual uni land apy finance they're excellent royale finance 217 they've they obviously they obviously know their stuff because that is good they've obviously seen hidden value in these i've never heard of geek archer doubt i've heard of zenfuse insured and hive look at that so look at that it's already gone up 111 last well it's only really a 2x i guess but it's pretty much gone up 50 of that in the last 24 hours so as people have started to catch up so there we are um so alex olivier olivieri great shout good one um you see p chain you can see p chain let's have a look at pj because they are not on any of my lists or anything even though i'm still highly invested in them two two cents about 103 thousand dollars of volume it's really irrelevant right now um that doesn't mean it's not going to could potentially power in the future but this was a 2018 narrative got into this roughly the same time i got into bit max but they they just fell off a cliff super can you check out uh c e eq ok blair not that patent pending consensus protocol called proof of honesty interesting it's not there either um let's have a look oh geek not seek right okay um so that was literally the one that we just saw was also on um vendetta's radar so this has a ten to one reach no not ten to one so a hundred to one ratio of market cap to volume it's pretty this has been out since the since the um kind of summer last year altcoin run let's have a look and see let's see if they qualify at all so patent pending consensus called well they're on um vendetta's list so geek is a multi-block chain platform secured by our proof of honesty protocol safe enough for mostly available date cheap enough for iot which is the internet of things flexible enough for any use i imagine these could be their partners so i've never heard of these morpheus labs trust plasma chain link ibm cloud limitless ecosystems very clean website very sick very um salivating kind of website actually and pass security built to last everybody wins this is basically like a trust network for the internet of things integrating chain link again they haven't put their their partners i think after a while they stop doing it they probably do it to initially gain trust embrace blockchain with confidence vendetta they're just they're only on vendetta um so it doesn't seem to be anything defy related this seems to be something that's belt kind of for the seasons um okay let's have a quick look at their white paper see if there's anything we can glean from that hi-fi finance rico lexo thank you for the five whatever chf is check out hi-fi finance that is basically previously mainframe and uh you know i am completely off mainframe so go ahead i hate them um new blockchain consensus empowers users to who hold tokens on the platform to determine for themselves whether the network are validating losers behaving honestly this allows geek to provide 99 for byzantine fault tolerance that's basically a consensus algorithm which means that the most honest parties flash out the um you know the bad actors whilst during rapid transaction finality so this is basically going to be an ecosystem i imagine multi-chain architecture interoperable funny though that only vendetta seems to have seen the the promise of this instance of geek chain is the blockchain that uses validation protocols principation of chain token names it basically seems like an incredibly trustworthy protocol or should i say consensus pro consensus algorithm application layer customizable support smart contracts logic dapps validation manager's basic toasting transactions this is multi-layer it's basically a multi-layered um trust network uh ecosystem so he's pretty good actually for the price seems pretty good 11 11 000 surprised i think this must just be i think it's because it's not a current narrative it's not nft it's not by the smart chain it's not d5 it's more a generalistic operating system i suppose um b pro be pro unfortunately you're never going to find me caring too much about b pro because of what they do um although that i mean they're basically three to one maybe even less than that but i just don't building the future of d5 gaming i mean it's like exceed me these things just they have they they hold literally no no in my opinion i would never invest in it hence why i never really cover it but um that doesn't mean this isn't quality if you wanted to get invested in it for uh speculative point of view i think it's already kind of gone up too high 17 million and it was down at 205. so it has what 50 next in essence um staking farming gaming prediction markets it concentrates on gaming like if it actually said that they concentrated on predictions like polka markets i would actually find you have to you have to really dig into that one then uh can you look at cardio chain let's have a look at cardio and then i will have a look at um these whale whale lists 118 pointless um [Music] meter i just see the thing is just just so you know i have no interest in anything that's already approaching 100 million it's just pointless it's just they're not going to deliver 100 x's um so meter let's have a look at meter then now meter seems to have let me just let me just have a look meter actually has defined structure with uncensorable sound money they are kind of building the base layer for d5 now they say now on the whale app if they've only got a u-21 but if we look further down they've actually got pantera and g big so that is pretty insane because these are two humongous crypto currencies okay now this is 1.9 mil this is 1.9 mil okay and they have got pantera and gbic now they don't even put a u-21 in here their partners suitor asu which have been trending on coin market cap pretty much five days in a row chain link is that origin proto nurse not um elrond anchor stp dos what's that matic nest which do you like thermostats and smart smart home um you know kind of appliances so let's have a look more into this the chinese team it looks like let me just have a look at the co-founder it says here top qualifications from leading academic institutions wharton which like top top american business schools where donald trump went to stanford don't know purdue us ucsd oh that is uh world cup experience gained from google cisco huawei looks pretty looks pretty mad ceo at decentralized finance labs cmt capital so he's the ceo of a fund that invests in fintech etc fintech blockchain but he's also the ceo of meter so he is not one of the googles actually let me just have a look oh he went to wharton right smart lad smart man very smart man let's have a look at yang yang nothing but he's from some he's from the bay area it's pretty cool um let's have a look at the cryptographic architect i take it this is the guy with the brains stanford future way principal system architect senior director at this place as well she's doing two jobs so meet has been around two years how long has this been trading for since summer so they've been around a while then core developer co-founder and core developer here's the other brains purge you i don't know what purge you is senior software engineer who are way nanjing university of science it seems a smart team to be fair seems a very good team they're um institut their investors really check out um road map fully launch the ethereum bridge erc 20 token token functionality launch developer program implement governance process those three things so you can buy on mxc uni swap who gate io which is good because it means you can avoid the gas fees um i think that what what's confusing if you go to if you go to meter is that there are a couple of tokens me to stay will meet a governance meter so really there's there's like two let's have a look and see how that one differs it's stable oh it doesn't and that's got even less volume so anyway let's have a lucky work and have a look at look see see what it is so it looks like d5 infrastructure with uncensorable sound money highly decentralized ethereum scaling solution with a metastable gas currency it connects to ethereum and other public blockchains as a layer 2 protocol so it seems like it's quite similar to zk ck swap meter meter is a layer 1 permissionless low voltage currency without collateral oracle or regulatory risk so basically it seems like they don't need outside technologies bolting into it because they've got quite a lot built in fully decentralized no collateral needed to create meter making it immune blah blah blah fast and scalable so it seems like it's already got built in our class both me to use an innovative economic and consensus design that separates currency creation proof work with record keeping proof stake and is supported by the price of 10 kilowatt hour of electricity which is more stable in purchasing power than any fiat currency in the world health meter can be used every day payment store of value meter can be used for everyday purchases store of value it maintains its long-term value so are they looking to essentially create a online online online micropayments currency with fast settlement because it's it's um it's within it because within it has a layer 2 protocol but in itself it's built-in speed it's got built-in speed so yeah that seems what it is essentially it's meant to be a micro payments platform seems cool actually it seems good seems like it's got clever people and uh i think the only confusion here is the fact that this has got quite a few other tokens but otherwise that is i think i think meter actually is very good and i was quite i think that was a quite in-depth look gala games so this 209 million market cap literally no point can you check out sing i'll have a quick look but there's just no point at this level like we're not looking for ones that have already pumped we're looking for pre-pum owned by players already hate it join revolution today gala games mission games smart contract gala node yeah it's already pumped go for chain guardians i would say can you check out a signature chain check out signature chain signature chain 44 5.8 mil with 11 000 volume eleven thousand volume did this it was a thousand two hundred like five hundred this has been around two years and now all of a sudden now it's been around two years had essentially all invested in it like volume zero zero 400 this is a gamble massive gamble it looks like it's just been pumped it's built on waves which is like well ancient now and waves was basically a tokenization ecosystem that people really used back in mid 2017 simply the process of document certification yeah look oh  let me have a look and just just make sure i mean i pretty much think i know the answer to this see if any whale investors have gone into it no decentralized document certification using blockchain technology bowler bricks in my opinion coin this is a this is a coin season pump um let me catch up uh marcelo morales thank you very much right okay cool i've gone to the end of the superchats for now so let us let us now go and have a look right so we're going to just start from the top right we're going to just start from the first one and and work our way down so what is that i think the first one is going to be pantera sky no limits up champ condolences i have too many coins to sell a bunch go on to all in on five coins which five coins would you choose i ain't gonna answer that like you have to make a personal choice i can't tell you what to buy i just tell you what's around who's invested why you may want to invest but i will never say you should buy etc right so let's start with the pantera panteras biggie so as you can see they are in ethereum terrar file coin near protocol they they can pick them they can pick them pantera is one of the big big eight vcs icon 0x omg one inch wax etc so if we go down where where we want to be looking is kind of sub sub 30 million i would say um so the sub 30 millions rpo is like flipping old so an api has really gone up so let's have a look so power trade data i think is an outlier meter we've just looked at gems is old atari bloom i think bloom has been around a while and flex a coin why aren't they these two have been around a while why haven't they got any price data so let's have a look at power trade fuel first of all i think that's already kind of gone up a lot but let's just let's just check it out anyway so it's 18 to 18 to 1 roughly there's 17 to 1. so this has been around since october let's have a look let's have a look at this crypto options level up with bitcoin options trading quick straight forward all mobile so mobile enabled i think the first time i saw it i was puffed by the name like who would call their business powertrade fuel i mean you got google facebook twitter um uber you know paypal those are cool names and then you got power trade fuel just sounds stupid now why would you do that the branding's awful but the value proposition seems like it it's it's not stupid now crypto options that's derivatives essentially now it's mobile it's mobile enabled futures trading apparently power to the trader without with options you'll be bullish bearish or both on bitcoin it's your call you're the boss provides an intuitive powerful interface to help you easily analyze the market manage your risk and seize profitable trading opportunities so essentially what this seems like is it's like i suppose a mobile enabled by bit that's what i think they are trying to be mobile enabled by bet so let me just have a let me use this as a starting point and have a look and see who else is in power trade i don't think there are many from what i saw but let me just quality check it oh wow they have three commas cms holdings they're good dan eliza from mit bitcoin club um signum i've heard of kane warwick founder of synthetics and pantera and bobby ong who's the ceo of coin gecko wow wow okay no that's pretty good so it's all-time high was a couple of weeks ago so it's probably still due it's probably got a lot of room in the upside then given where this is it's not ideal really so it's a 92 cent so at its lowest let me just look for its lowest ever value all-time low was 13 cents so we are somebody can probably do this much better in their head ninety three divided by thirteen so it's only seven x it's only seven x really it's probably got a hell of a lot of way to go in this i like it no i do like it actually it's just i think i was put off by the name crypto options you know even if even if this goes nowhere even if this dies like the risk is mitigated simply because of how many um how many of the big whales are in this so basically one two phoenix vc i think i've looked at phoenix but then kane warwick bobby ong and pantera so that is five people i would trust there pretty good pretty good i'm gonna add this to low cap d5 plays at some point but not right now because that would be a little bit annoying on the old time scale right so now this is what's annoying about doing this whole process by the way is that you've got to come out and all the way back into it again it goes right it defaults right to the front page of coin market cap so i'm just going to have to try and be as entertaining in the interim as possible and guys please if you could if you want me to literally stay the longer you want me to stay on the more you should smash the like so we're 179 likes 464 people so all you need to do people is quite literally very little i have to do all the work you have to only go either that or um yeah but just smash that like just smash it anyway so um let's go um [Music] let's go to the next one fen bushi van bushi is one of the big ones and you can see that by who they've invested in they've been around a long time so v chain eos uh rsr um kyber seller seller um math woo basically seller was okay but matic it was basically what what made me drop seller was matic i invested into matic from my seller profits so i think that was a much better move but anyway yeah they seem to be doing okay now essentially they are made the scaling solution um like plasma i think they are um we trade nkn dx chain hash god that's old um okay so let's have a look so under 30 hash guard now hash guards old but it has gone up recently 167 000 volume not that interested in that now atlas let's have a look at atlas because it's gone up 82 20 in the last 24 hours so let's have a look at this so this is a two to one ratio so that shows us highly relevant so remember this is from fenbushi fombuchi is massive so let's have a looky work atlas so who are in atlas uh consensus ledger oh no they're nothing to do with actual and fembuchi so they seem to be the only ones really in it fenbushy nebulous i've never heard of them um yeah so really it's fen bushy and maybe consensus lab i've heard of before so alice interactive leader leading blockchain advertising and marketing platform large scale commercial implementation of atlas right okay so new interactive ads transformed form from online to on chain new interactive ads transformed i think that's not meant to be there transformed from online to unchain advertising value is effectively transmitted within the ecology through incentive interactive incentives programming advertising and intelligence analytics to prove it so it's basically it's basically an advertising platform all right so we've had um what was it i don't remember the name there but whatever the the cryptocurrency hive hive was the recruitment and this is advertising um one free trial one click instant results hundreds of channels with not when one stop advertising covering millions of blockchain audiences advertiser finance oh cool so this is like so this is like advertising only in the crypto market so you're advertising and marketing in the crypto market so let's say you got a new blockchain or let's say you've got a crypto news website and you want to advertise it you've got a token sale you want to advertise it you can advertise on binance who ob don't know who they are gate bitmap buy box neo contentos contentos is essentially like um like a youtube ish platform seller one chain and some others publishers who will you be any ones i really recognize so as a leading blockchain advertising platform atlas interactive applies one-stop programming solution to get access to high quality advertising inventory reduce cost increase roi investors and partners i should just have gone to this so there we are van bushi and consensus and i don't recognize any of the others aws or amazon web services press anybody can get press that seems pretty cool but it's not trending in my opinion i don't know why quite has gone five five point nine mil but that just shows you that smart money follows smart money right so you know fembouchia in this um they're obviously like they've obviously got in much earlier wow so this has actually been around a while it's actually been around a while should have gone to this first shouldn't i that's been around ages i wonder how many campaigns they've actually done this has been around a long time and its highest value was all the way back and about three cents and now it's point four cents so it's 10x down 10x down but it looks like it's exploded in relevance recently let me just have a look at the let me see how recently it's exploded so before today it's like someone got hold of this list before me or something and just kind of rinsed some of the top the the low low market caps so it was look it's been nowhere even as low as 86 000 a couple of weeks ago and now all of a sudden it's just pumped to six mil so something has let's have a look on medium see if they've what they've done token economy eddie eliader so that was ages ago their last medium post was october what the hell um okay so let's have a look on twitter this makes no sense let me just check out the super chats as i can see people are super chatting defining blockchain interactive marketing yada yada what this makes no sense unless something's going on we don't know about this makes no sense at all their last tweet was to set was 2020. hmm yeah i ain't touching that i don't know what the hell that just seems like a risk something either something's going on or something's wrong with this picture so anyway yeah don't know what it is but that seems to be quite sus so let's go back now let me just have a few let me just have a look and see uh well super chats may have may or may not have come in in that time um yeah meter just just talked about it uh oh meter is the gas token mtrg is the moon investor token all right so hold on which one did we look at then yeah so the one we looked at was the governance token yeah right okay okay so so mtr is gas um soda's flying is it let's have a look at soda i think this was probably the only nft not to pump recently 68. holy crap so this was on really low volume and now is absolutely sword yes well done peeps well done peeps i did like the look of this i really did like the look of this and it took a long time for it to pump but it's still 1.12 but it's like uh wow it's a one to two ratio which is actually a massive positive um okay and then i know you like how great it's just found a sleeping sleeping giant unidex unidex mark cap 3.4 i was testing the beta man it's amazing you'll love it um all right let's see is you need dex on here oh it is oh i don't know if you people saw but elon musk honestly a guy is a is a massive meme um but anyway elon musk uh tweeted about shiba whatever it was inu was that dumbass um d5 platform just because it was like doge and then it just shut up like 10x i think the ultimate defy trading terminal built on ethereum take control measure ethereum one in one place london borough then borrow swap tokens limit orders does that mean it's mobile enabled limits limit orders that's cool limit orders is cool you don't know what limit orders is basically you sell you you it's like buy or sell triggers at a certain price uh manage your default positions liquidity blah blah blah draw liquidity from multiple sources one inch etcetera competitive profit share governance let's see how big their community is a telegram 2400 okay and this is 3.4 mil apparent yeah 3.4 million apparently but it's got like uh absolutely terrible volume but a 3.4 mil market cap and essentially it's an exchange an aggregator it doesn't seem so bad actually let me just have a look and see if anybody has actually invested in this mofo you need dex no results so outlier anything anything others um hidden gem arianny ariani oh that's actually there area 20 169 25 mil wait a minute this is 25 mil this is essentially a 50 mil market cap which is 260. yeah 60 ml market cap what is the  point um if that is the if that's the real market cap then that's terrible can you check out nash exchange nah check out wow.finance they filled the pre-sale at 300k it's on bsc and filled in seconds dum dum non-inflationary d fighter designed to provide profits generating strategies to the holders executing autonomously with a complete decentralized approach farm seems all right i mean it seems shite but it seems fun what was that wow i bet that's not even on here is it no that's not this is wow swap 300k let me just make sure it's not this one well swap no it's not right okay um check out economic pro yep done right okay so let's uh but thank you very much sorry that may sound like it was really really unappreciative thank you very much brian for the contribution really appreciate that um e e r sdl i'll look at that in a while e r stl right so um so we looked at one from pantera one from fembushi let's go to genesis block ventures these are my favorites to be fair these are amongst my favorites phoenix flow look at that as well so let's have a look so gbv omg reef these guys have gotten into the hottest latest projects omg reef linear so look lily is their third best performing one so thank you gbb super farm ethernet chain public mint pools so under 30 is public meant pools apy swap happy these ones we don't know because they don't have the market caps play sent um i wonder if that's on here it really does annoy me when they don't have the market caps so annoying right okay apologies for the slight rant there um let me just see if i can find it now how long has placent been around this let me just make sure that it is uh sod off let me just make sure that it is um a low cap oh son off um 7.2 million 7.2 million right okay so 7.2 that sounds like that sounds like it will be a three three point six let's have a look uh seven two zero zero zero zero zero that might be a bit much there three point three nice three point three right three point three four so let's have a look and see what this is so play sent was ngc right so let's have a look at them not in gc globe um gbv so let's have a look and see what play center is oh how long has it been around oh wow oh no hold on i'm looking at a 24 hour view oh no it has one two three four days four days this has been out and you can get it on uni swap 502 000 but it's point three and a half million market cap so 3.2 million market cap somebody's dming me 3.2 million market cap so that's about six to one so it's not that bad actually six to one ratio so that's and it's only got four percent upset rating look four percent of people are upset with it that's pretty high so let's take a gander and it's 10.2 now play center is a blockchain power template based platform allowing developers gamers and creators to monetize their skills developers gamers and creators one platform for any use case let me just check out place and let me see how many venture capitalists they have are we getting ee interviewed for decentralized wix so this is basically a consumers to brands our templates oh so this is like a mode this is like a website builder or uh um it's just like a business like i suppose a platform builder for dapps games nfts and social tokens play center is a blockchain based user generated content platform for interactive apps and games remix tool now that anyone can use to make interactive games mini apps and memes tick tock popularized remix culture uses remixing existing video that's good but playset wants to go once and further by making mini apps games and memes re-mixable so they got moon whale gbv and phoenix which i said earlier block sync yeah this looks this looks really good actually social esports dapps nfts many apps games now i got into um linear when it was 1.5 i want to say anywhere between four hundred 000 to 1.4 million market cap so this is current standpoint is just about double what linear was and it's not really taken off yet it has been 32 cents so it has it's like gone up just a little bit since it's low it's only gone up ten percent since this no 43 since all time low yeah this one looks really good this is probably the best one so far today well this and power fuel wow this is a good video peeps this is a good video all the people missing out on it yeah wow wow wow wow some great ones here i'm gonna add a couple now to um are there any others while we are here ap weiss what we've looked at pools pools pools pools pools i think is basically a polka starter competitor so i'm going to look at pools in a minute and let me just add this to the low cap d5 plays because i think these are two these are two potentially really strong ones placent don't know why i just get a really good feeling about that one i think it's just because it looked very colorful and clean on mofo why is it got polka dot oh area and power trade yeah add those two oh tell me this is not a great great stream people tell me this is not a great stream and we are not even done yet so market cap was um 3.2 mil 3.0 3.34 mill check out font have a quick look at font 14 300 i wish let me have a look and see if it's on um on here oh yeah they have got my cap on here so 4.4 mil ten to one market captor trade volume ratio how long has it been out three quarters of a month it's already gone up a thousand a thousand percent so it's basically a 10x um nft nft font dot community and it's aetherium doesn't sound great but this could this could be one of those nft based decentralized font marketplace front of d5 enabled nfts you know what right think about this okay like i'm just gonna play devil's advocate i'm not telling you i'm investing in it but just think about it right the current font marketplace system as it were so if you go to one of those font websites daffon or something like that um you can buy the ability to um get that font onto your computer but you don't own it you don't own the font you literally just have the rights to use the font just like anybody else who buys it but imagine that you've got this really quite incredible font that no one else will ever be able to use and you own that and you can sell it because in of itself it's artwork right but it's dynamic artwork because you're always you can always write with it right it's not a static thing so there is a potential market for this display mono space or if sensor if handwriting community and dft the nft based font marketplace font equals nft plus d5 plus del transfer ownership issuing a share creators can split the font ownership as a share and start selling it to the community oh so you can like share you can't share it okay font owners can borrow money against their font for lending protocols this actually doesn't seem too bad a speculative bet to be fair let's see how big their telegram is a thousand not hardly anyone this is hardly known interesting so look at that twitter me just see if it's got any investors i doubt it i see that a lot of the big whale investors aren't even bothering to get into um the current nft plays no no not one but it is the only one from app 2.0 colorful design advanced ux compact blah blah blah so this will probably go up just based on that how do we turn comic sans into an nft we can do that it doesn't seem too bad actually uh it doesn't seem too bad at all i kind of like it i kind of like fun i gotta be honest with you i kind of like it um it's just is the marketplace that interested is that is the ecosystem that interested in it could be don't know anyway um okay so we've gone through the super chat um so let's now go back so we've gotten two good ones so we've gotten of ones we've looked through the list so we've got place and power fuel now let's look for a third look at ken can i'm gonna look at crap tokens um right okay right now um should i get another one let's look at au21 ae21 i've got some good ones recently too oh uh the graph reef the one that shall not be mentioned injective super farm carry frontier um terror purlin crust you know their these guys have gotten involved in somewhere i have seen promised and no other venture capitalists have seen promise so let's have a look so under 30 mil they got zero props props has been around a while public meant that's not only 16 mil that's essentially looking tricky to create like a currency system replicant it's almost like the digital fiat system ensure content box and meter they're also in hopper exceed me defy wizard ether lend let's have a look and see what market cap e for lenders i think it's four mil eight mill okay forget that one then and now we looked at it the other day anyway um hopper what's hopper oh i've looked at hot powder um let's put it to you guys let's put it to you what do what what one do you think we should look at of what you can see here so essentially zero well we've kind of looked at zero props public min ensure content box what are you guys liking oh yeah we said we look at pools didn't we we'll have a look at paul's men looked at mint why didn't i even say min really looked at it okay um so what's hopper there seems to be quite a lot of we've already looked at public man there's literally no need to look at that again we looked it in a previous episode in detail i think hopper's already already flown actually let me just have a look it won't take me two seconds to find out while we're waiting people if you have just joined please smash the like i would be very very appreciative uh 88 mil right yeah too far gone too far gone no point um snow snow's not even on there is there snow's on there i don't know why people are saying snow on odd odd right let's have a look at content box then because that's one i don't know about i don't know content box now how long has this been around and let me have a look and see who is in it oh it's been around ages i hate ones like this it's probably got some legs in it still au21 spark god they've got loads of investors ld capital link vc but then this was years ago i don't really see the point in looking at this one because it's oh it's old no forget it they up um and now we start right from the bloody beginning again i believe oh no we don't yes we do pretty much um yeah okay so that was a u-21 and i thought that was a bit a bit shy so let's look at um one of my all-time favorites ngc they tend to find some beauties uh no i was about to say these guys got me into bit max but they didn't anyway let's have a look at ngc so they've gotten involved in polkadot solana algorand elrond zilliqa reserve rights ontology scale reef anchor reef is is more valuable than anchor now utter utterly ridiculous um okay so marlin nash that was many years ago god 274 now that's pretty good so that has nearly 4x okay so they've got some beauties here so under 30 we've got razer which we've covered kira which we've covered this is liquid staking headget which we've covered which is basically options trading ap white swat we've covered multivac now this has been around a while multivac raven protocol there might be a few in this one there's only got 13 000. plot x look at this trinity right this is lola's trinity yeah lola's trinity it's 145 up in the last seven days this is a dead project what are people thinking and it just shows you just shows you how stupid money is around around this time um okay so let's have a quick look at plot x because that is the lowest market cap and it's four to one we'll look at plot x and orego right so we've got a few to look at now we've got pulls our ego and plot x so let's have a gander at this because this is on a dip so this could be a good opportunity potentially so yeah so this is this is relatively new november that's all right that's all right and it's only just started to start to go up so it was four cents it's only gone up 4x in all that time so it could be right for the picking let's have a look plot x 303 likes people thank you very much i love you all ah d5 prediction markets products is a non-custodial that means you don't put the money directly on the uh prediction protocol that allows you to earn rewards on high-yield prediction markets why has this not been picked up ngc trg genesis block 2 three commas partners matic chain link that is ridiculous these actually look alright wow so right people on the face of it this is 4.4 million market cap it's four to one five to one i suppose five to one market cap to volume ratio and its predictions so let me just have a look at some prediction protocol so prosper what's prosper on now so that's 23 so that is 8x maybe 7x 7x more than plot x and where can where can you get plot x let me just have a look oh you can go on bit max oh cool so you don't need to even spend that much like in gas fees that's excellent right okay so it's predictions what's another prediction one why does my brain escape me right now guys save me other predictions other prediction protocols trinity is a joke i must admit power trade fuel is 19 mil polka markets that's it that's what i was trying to think of so how's poker markets doing no you can't even find out um anyway um option room that's another one option on my doesn't i don't think has really gone up that much 40 right so this is 10x so plot x has essentially got all of these partners and all of these venture capitalists and yet it is still 10x cheaper than optionrum which is already cheap so automated market making i think polka markets an option on polkadot whereas this is i take it this is aetherium yes ethereum i think that is what what stands in its way a little bit it's not trending right now but market automated market making quick turnaround crypt focus crypto markets its own focused only on prediction of crypto asset prices instant rewards but on a theorem interest reward settlement on chain or may calculations liquidity mining can you actually do any of it let's have a look yeah yup yup whatever so this is beta markets created obviously create a market it's not real that's not that's not really my domain it doesn't charge any fee for market creation however you need to pay gas fee to the settlement infrastructure okay that's that is that is probably something that's a little bit annoying interesting yeah i gotta admit i think that's great i think that's a really good one right plot x is going on my list now that's quite weird that's quite weird how this is so low in value how big is their telegram six thousand it's just arguably quite big let's have a look on medium see if there's anything new plot with new simpler safer login plot is going to be moving to layer 2 soon how'd steak plot oh you can stake plot and earn ro roya paid razer and om dot to become a third pair in markets yeah quite like that that's pretty good yeah i like it i like it i like it safe safe safe safe safe wi-fi is not a bar call on this vessel book but check out bsc v which is owned by bsc pad as the next dex tools finance bar chain i think that's bsc is that bsev oh right right now i am an antichrist i'm not really okay i just felt like singing a little bit of whatever their names are sex pistols have i missed anything check out vibe vibes old isn't it i was a ancient coin yeah oh oh vibe maybe i was thinking of fib i don't know let me have a look i don't know yeah this is enchant um i hate these platforms they they they start off as something and then decide that they want to get into nfts or get into d file or some nft vibe vibe net rare auctions game nodes let's leave it in the past in my my personal opinion um yeah i think that's that i think i've gotten to the end of the oh yeah bsc view so do you see this has been an incredibly fruitful um yeah incredibly fruitful like uh strategy here it's basically just taking all of the best and replicating them following the smart money people this this video is going to essentially be a time stamp on the prices as they stand today and we'll see uh bsc view anyway so this is two to one six million is it really twelve percent a bit pissed did this start off quite high then i started off high 2.2 so this has gone down 4x so this was previously what's 24 million 25 million it's gone down to a six million market cap i guess people probably got involved when it was um because it's bsc pad right pulse of finance smart chain trading so it is essentially better decks tools it's basically dex tools in collaboration with bsc pad and ferrum bsc is on a mission to create the first destination for bsc traders it's all right but like access fully featured charting interface uh for pairs across my smart bios smart chain ecosystem gain and educates users who trade blind okay i suppose that's what it is right i guess that's what it is you kind of have an early indication of of what could be profitable on buying a smart chain and finances is really becoming has really emerged just like an aetherium beta recently so that is not a bad that is not bad good morning superman sending cool vibes from down under we would like to know what are your thoughts on casper.ico okay so let me just have a quick look actually so anyway bsc view looks okay yeah i kind of like it looks a good good um entry point um however my my the reason why i like it and dislike it at the same time i like it because it's relevant and i dislike it because it doesn't look like it solves a pain as such like i can see there's a little bit of a benefit but there's no real pain and if there was pain the money would definitely follow um oh yeah casper okay casper labs so they have been invested in by au21 woodstock woodstock so-called woodstock thunder essentially they are um they're a venture capital fund they're relatively new they're not traditional vcs they're relatively new and it's basically a community of people who believe in the ethos of woodstock which is like free thinking and and uh creativity and all that kind of stuff and that is what they invest in so anyway so there so they've invested in them um arrington xrp gate dot io that means that's going to be listed without a shadow of adele so arrington hashkey i've heard of au21 and woodstock 25 investors in casper so let's have a look right okay okay let's have a look at this then until now blockchain technology has been a series of compromises no layer one protocol exists in the market that supports everything enterprises developers and consumers need from decentralized applications we've built the casper network to provide the existing and emerging blockchain ecosystem with a solution that makes no compromises and finding my name for sustainable enterprise consumer and developer adoption i'm meta parlicar co-founder and cto of casper labs the team behind the casper network previously i've overseen multi-million dollar tech stacks including adobe avalera mp3.com divex and many more i'm renault manager co-founder and ceo of casper labs we have assembled technology experts business leaders and experienced advisors from across the blockchain enterprise and cloud industries to bring to market the most advanced secure and reliable proof-of-stake smart contract platform casper is not a fork of an existing blockchain rather it has been built from the ground up based on work outlined in the original casper cbc specification on top of that scalable secure and decentralized proof-of-stake architecture we have included features to optimize it for mass adoption casper is developer friendly instead of using a proprietary language casper supports web assembly there are nearly 30 million developers in the world and casper is designed so that any of them can start building applications right it's that's a four minute long video so i'm not going to go into the whole thing but essentially it looks like it's a scalable ethereum it looks like it's a ethereum um uh competitor essentially um so somebody said the other day that noddle.io was a cardano killer or whatever i think that actually might be so yeah i quite like that that is probably a slam dunk i would imagine if you got into the right time i think that's almost certain slam dunk what do you think of yieldprotocol.org now there is one which i know is going to be absolutely belter and that is this yield is now i was hoping the yield protocol was actually yield is in disguise because yield.is is basically a powerhouse lending borrowing dap that looks utterly insane and i thought that this was because there's no token for this so i thought that your protocol was that it's not unfortunately but um yield dot is looks great i haven't really looked at your protocol other than to check it wasn't yield is deploy algorithmic device strategies your protocols open source platform allowing anybody to create and execute yield farming and trading strategies on the ethereum t5 ecosystem simple and secure smart contracts multi-purpose design smart contracts open and permission lists one token type altogether yield shield which is uh yield farming aggregator okay so it's essentially a protocol that enables anybody to create yield farming strategies um let me see how big is that thingy majiggy thank you very much bart everybody if you can do the batman no no no no no no no my thoughts on safety finance was i thought it was very good right somebody is saying aced check out aced i imagine that's giancarlo who's been saying it for the last 10 years and unfortunately i don't have a moderator which actually annoys me but what can you do um 75 masternodes come on all right let's have a look aced several i can see if it's on the whale app no it's not all right okay let's have a look then oh hold on let me just go back have a look how long has this been around what it's been around forever and it's gone up two million percent in a year all right okay let's have a look it looks utterly awful digital entertainment hub it's finance smart chain that's all it's got that's all it's got going for it crypto based sports book live sports betting it looks god awful but if you want to invest in a gambling website or gambling whatever platform on binance smart chain there you go people there you go um okay um is noodle and ada keller no it's not the casper is but ada is not casper looks like it could be the birth of a big powerhouse actually i have to admit i think it could be the birth of something special um let me just get rid of some of these summer lease yeah meter meter looks really good did i add meter i'm not sure if i did actually let me add it to the huge list of micro cap d5 plays some of which have actually graduated since then [Music] um come on mofo twitter from dot is takes you to yield protocol are you sure all right let me just um let me just clear some of these because linear is no longer a micro cap it's graduated basically that's what we want to be doing is we want to have a load of graduations which we still hold so we'll take that one off as well well purlin has become an 80 million market cap now wow crust that graduated quick this was 19 million when i brought it to you now it's 56. i'll keep it on there um because it's not just on the cast bsc pad 44 mil let's have a look let's have a look so you go down go down the list well play sentence got right up now uh mutex token right okay cool cool guys we've had a great stream so far this is the stream of prosperity um okay metallics metal x mtlx all right i'll check that out chris marks thank you for the ten dollars would you go all in on convergence or moonbeam if you had to choose one that is a friggin fantastic question uh but it would be moonbeam yeah b moonbeam easy easy he's throwing the sweets in supposed direction isn't he he's angry though look at the screen he's bending down there doing something powered by fetch ai okay well world's first dex focused on token based commodities trading accessible 24 7 with type trading spreads and unique hedge instruments yeah good but it's already this is 32 mil and it's a seven seven ish seven to one ratio which is all right actually pretty good pretty healthy um it's aetherium it's got 100 satisfaction push me and i will get my satisfaction satisfaction yeah 78 cents ages ago and it's 10x since then um yeah yeah it looks okay advanced autonomous marker makers petrol liquidity mining let me have a look and just make sure no one meh metallics derivatives exchange fetch ai are the only investors in this um yeah i mean it's okay but it's not low it's not micro and it's not um well investors so not that interested but if you are then by all means research this and what the f is alex alice is basically my neighbor alice is a new uh cryptocurrency coming to um finance very shortly well will moon be much on polka dot unfortunately yes is my neighbor alice any good yes my neighbor alice let me just find out um let me help see who's invested in my neighbor alice so that's coming out on finance and it is invested by genesis block um ngc an x21 so one biggie and two mid tens so that's a good that's a good one and of course some finance so they've probably got a stake in it too um all right okay let's let's look for one more one more let's have a look one more um let's go back to the ngc um let's look at alameda let's look at alameda now remember people if um i'm not really one to be like saying buy this buy this or whatever yeah buy my course by michael's by my course i'm not really one for that but i mean i'm just just trying to if you want um if you want a really good explanation about the uh the thingy majiggy then essentially this is the course to get the d5 cryptocurrency investment course 2021 how to invest in the best and i cover all of the uh how to how to essentially get um your hands on all of this info right okay so let me have a look again ap what opm i bought you the other day opium oh oh oh no we won't go through this one actually so they're in convergence persistence i'm taking it that's not out yet covalent as well let me just check persistence i doubt it is out no it's not right okay fair fair fair um or as harry would say fair fe fe all you enough coverage armor i've kind of covered so we'll look at a different one now i've covered a lot of these anime that are good i'll give them that they are very good at picking them they're almost as good as the superman hit factory i've got to say nearly not quite but nearly um let's have a look at three arrows i don't think they've done many actually three arrows are one of the they're like premier league i would say um yeah so anyway look ave synthetics kyber they're really big on d5 m stable but that's yeah okay that's a bad bad example they they very rarely get involved so i suppose keep a dow because that's 13 mil that's probably the the one that hasn't yet lifted so i had three arrows what's another one paradigm i got paradigm in here paradigm they're very selective i wonder if veil now that can't be that fail let me just check i think there's two veils let me just go into that one yeah the veil that i'm interested in is a prediction market as a predictions one and that's veil.market and this is veil hyphen project so this should not be in here oh well that's a shame because that looked like it was it was okay god sift is doing so super well get in there sift chain linea when top 100 when that goes on finance i imagine it will how do you get into moon beam i have no idea i have no idea oh i get it now um karen what the is alice that's a saying isn't it you weren't actually seriously asking um vortex vortex i've looked at um i tend to only want to cover um new ones that's really my area hold on just mute that have i looked at fbg let's have a look at fbg and then all right so they got into terror chili's die silica ren i they're good these guys are very good so let's have a look in the low cap area there's not many that's i imagine it's low cap for them anymore um p chain old arc blocker old cred oh or ego i said i was gonna look at that didn't i you chain i think that's old dfx finance that sounds well good konomi's gonna be good rate three let me just have a quick look at rate three how old is this oh it's ancient that's a sm that's annoying um okay so let's have a look at a few more so let's have a look at our ego first of all let's have a look and see what's doing well so far to path paint still smashing it placent acx meter wow these ones these ones are flying now as is power trade and happy okay um yeah so let's have a look at our ego how long has this been out because this has been on a couple of lists and it looks pretty promising um right so this is nearly two to one nearly two to one ratio here so that's very healthy how long has it been around july two june that's flipping annoying let's have a look and see what it is let's do another tweet bang right our ego privacy preserving pro platform for decentralized applications privacy is dying online blah blah blah blah first decentralized application platform that protects your privacy like this may have been true back in yeah forget this one that's just a waste of time let's try pulls okay paul's let's see if this one's got legs so it's gone 12 13 million market cap has only been out a little bit 33 33 was this all-time high 687 jesus 687 to 33 and now it's 19. so it's not fallen hugely and the market cap is the volume exceeds the market cap so let's have a look at this ah nice nice nice nice cross chain token pools and auctions so i imagine this is a way of raising funds for star projects no matter what blockchain so it doesn't necessarily have to be polka dot last idea bot ocean bhatt ocean let me just see if that's a quality project it's obviously um what's it called um pokestar does do probably the best poke polka dot projects okay i'll look at arga for you gumo thank you very much for the four dollars um okay let me have a look safer by ocean everybody if you can do the part man no that's a bit disappointing otc deals create a pool for your token where investors get immediate access to your tokens token pools specify custom lock-in periods nft auctions bring them on to nfts to d5 create an auction for your non-logical tokens one-stop liquidity manager competitive swap environments why not the potential of decentralized finance make blockchains interoperable so if this is if this is cross chain they don't they have got binance so binance launch pads so binance projects can launch on here already integrated moon beam tomo chain so moon beams there's going to be a platform for moon beam ethereum tomo chain oh so they haven't got it yet so cross chain swap integrations coming quarter two so that will be next month so for migration polka dot nft support so these are essentially what's giving it some short-term value someone can see how many followers they got on twitter this looks great i don't know why i've never really looked at this before 31.4 million k followers who else who else follows them of my network dima polka project okay two units eating lunch three units right let's have a look and see how many they've got in their telegram 16 000 there seems something very wrong here 13 million this has got 13 million market cap 16 million volume it's a starter it's a um a starter for ido's ideo auctions it can run across polka dot ethereum moon beam tomo chain finance smart chain and future in the coming months this could be a potential goliath i mean let's look at another one right so this is one that's come out recently walt finance now this is seen as a binance pad bsc pad competitor because although they've got good yield uh within the d5 part of their platform they are also a um launch pad launch pad for new bsc projects now this let me see if walt is on it won't have their market what that's not true hold on one minute let me have a look because this could be very deceiving wall um one million one million uh i think that they've got 400 400k let me have a look circulating oh no that's right 623k 623.5k six two three five hundred times twenty six it's still not that bad i guess sixteen million market cap so it's uh pretty much double what it is on here um 16 million market cap and it's just finance and it looks pardon me french but where is it i mean look at that right look at this and i kind of like the font maybe they got it from font maybe it's their own nft but um look at the difference between that and paul's right and paul's actually has let me just find out let me see how many when investors are in pools decentralized layer 3 layer 3 what does that mean with pools we envision a trussless crypto market which offers prospective startups unbiased access to a willing and liquid market able to get a project off the ground while there are seven prime well there are several pioneering platforms offering liquidity pool opportunities the idea of pools is to make liquidity pooling available for the pre-selling phase of the project and for existing assets too so it takes out the initial barrier to entry blah blah blah so they've got genesis block and genesis block ventures so they've been invested in almost twice alphabet oh okay so we've only got really genesis block ventures phoenix vc and alphabet let me see who alphabet i've invested in launch pool paul's satoru so sar network rye finance wow yeah paul's paws is really strong i'm gonna add it it's more it's stronger than this and it's cheaper which is very weird and it's actually got um road map items which means that this should spike hard in this whole altcoin season and essentially what i'm interested in is if i was to make an investment now in something existing i.e not something that's new like moonbeam or convergence or anything like this new coming out if i was to invest in something that has been existing i would be looking to get in as the best possible time during a dip day so that i could ride the wave all the way through to october or end of the year so that with with road map items you can do that with something like wall you can't do it as well oh come on oh come on right so this was a good one how would you imagine the right way of implementing real estate tokenization why all the projects till date are either dying or are really small good good point um there was there is one labs something labs i don't know if it's even out yet um box mining talked about it and uh essentially i would say that the best way to tokenize real estate um is to it depends on what kind of real estate that's the pro that's the problem because i would say the best thing to do would be almost to have a block of it would be almost to just do um it'll just always be to do real estate in a digital format via nfts i suppose i don't know it's a very good question i guess that's why i've never really gotten into it because i don't understand i don't see how real estate fits in with nfts as such unless in the future when cryptocurrency becomes mainstream you probably you may not have estate agents you may just have nfts um you may have local real estate um like search engines like rightmove or um whatever you've got in your country zoopla or zillion whatever they're called and you will just have the ability to purchase these nfts which will incorporate everything to do with the property but the nft will be the ownership and that will be locked in on the blockchain so i imagine that's how it'll be done in future but it's still very very odd economize is so old and i got involved in that in 2017 it's part of um any other super chats i may have missed some thank you for lena what's happening with mdx thank you mr bosk what's happening with ndx it's not really defy season well it is but it's not it's more nft season right now nft is what he's ridic short answer is i don't know but i'm not going to lose sleep over it because i've i'm i'm pretty bullish on the future look at aeger i'll have a look at aegon let me see if anything's widely changed hmm i just think that nfts at the moment are the big thing they really are the big thing they all come it'll come back but we can still come back you get to come back let's have a look at agar then 29 000 it's not an awesome project that is a thousandth there's one in one thousand what the this is stupid it's annoying apologies but i get annoyed by dumbass projects thank you for the bitmap call it made me back scored me a lot of money do you think something similar to that can make big games yeah yeah of course and these have the right combination of all of the various money making qualities low micro cap whale investors soles of pain does something different um long road map etc but yeah there's loads of things yeah bit max bit max is just one of many that i mean the thing is with bit max is it's quite it's quite old 2018-19 and it's taken a long time to mature um it has gone through a despair stage which was the best time to buy it and it is now going through power stage which at the moment let me just have a look at bit max last i saw bitmaps about 1.30 so it's 130x and i still have 2.1 million bit max token so that is essentially two and a half million  insane just from 25 grand just goes to show but yeah there there's lots of them there will be lots of them but um it's kind of like it's kind of like a roulette table okay so let's say there are 36 half decent half decent um uh projects um really uh you know what you kind of want to do is you want to kind of spread let's say 10k across three and although all three may not win you know when the when you spin the wheel around when you spin the the thingy roulette wheel it may not land on any of them it's gonna land on something you just need to make sure it lands on what you have invested in and if you go all the money on one um it's a big gamble sometimes it can pay off you can win big but um you know with with with bitmaps because i do a lot of speculation um it was a winner you know i've invested in about 90 coins in my whole time in cryptocurrency and uh i've probably had five five or six hundred x plus hits so the average then is about oh so 90 divided by five 18. so imagine that being a roulette wheel where instead of 18 it's um instead of 36 it's 18 right i've essentially managed to strike it big one in 18 times you know so it's not easy but what i will say is that over time you know bit bags will probably be about 10 over time as long as you as long as the the project maintains activity relevance all the way through markets which is what you can do easily you know with defy and nfts they are very hot right now but cardano is going to be hot forever because that is an ecosystem that can utilize like well ethereum ethereum cardano these these particular projects they can utilize icos oops icos defy nft predictions you know whatever comes next security tokens identity whatever you know platforms come out these ecosystems like hedera hashgraph cardano and all that they are going to last but sometimes the the the defies the nfts they're very hot right now and they were very hot last summer and they're gonna be very hot through this bull market but they're probably not gonna be very very hot in three years four years time it's gonna calm down and it's gonna be a new narrative so you need to so the way to get most successful in cryptocurrency is to pick something that can outlast the narratives that's why i invest in infrastructure anyway where was i going i was going somewhere i was in aeger wasn't i a decentralized bitcoin mining protocol decentralized bitcoin mine protocol horizon agent for governance and aj agar art token for monthly rewards seems interesting but my bitcoin mining is not profitable so i can't imagine that it's going to really be able to produce much profit for people but i guess it's a way of having exposure to bitcoin mining as an extra passive income thing so it may not actually be that bad i think that perhaps it's being sold a bit short with its current or maybe people just don't get it people don't want to get it um super check on my i've checked it ten thousand times not gonna do it again uh property yeah it's true but it's old alpaca stock's in the house so you can now keep on um top of some of these thank you patrick glad you're here um in in a past video you referred to a ratio like one two one reviewing projects can you explain our ratio again yeah sure so basically what i look for um is relevance when i invest in anything like if you invest in something that's not relevant then really it's not going to go up um when there's a bullish day okay so what i mean is is let me use a better example than this let me use pools i guess so what i look for when i look for one to two is i look for if the market cap is 14 million and i don't look for one to two i look for one to five as a minimum so if the market cap is 14 then i would be looking for that to be around about two or three million volume that shows it's got relevance the higher the volume is as a ratio to market cap shows the relevance so two to one would essentially be seven million volume on a 14 million market cap but because this is 18 million essentially it's actually almost one to two nearly it's probably more one to one point 1.3 or something but this shows you that it's highly relevant this project is highly relevant which is very very surprising then this is down um but i think this is hot i think it's hot this is paul's finance gotta say and uh i have kind of flirted with with reviewing it but you know there's soon there's been so many exciting things lately that i haven't been able to get around to it but that is essentially what it what it is please slip not in the church i am a world before i am a man i um then you're all day paul's fake followers i don't know about that i don't know about fake followers let me have a look um what's this leprechaun game if i defy liquidity pool that was six hours hmm fake it till you make it peeps fake it till you make it oh here we are i think this is it is this the labs labs group yeah this is this is the labs thing i was talking about let me just go to labs what i've already i talked about decent decentralized oracles in the last video gringo nothing much more to say on it this has got a high amount of followers considering no one really knows about it how many have they got in telegram seventeen thousand anyway let me have a look at labs group so this is b this is launching shortly and this is trying to um tokenize real estate as an awful  website that looks terrible the world's first end-to-end blockchain powered real estate investment ecosystem so it's less than 24 hours it's coming out disrupting real estate investments in the largest asset class through world's first end-to-end investment ecosystem by fractionalizing real estate investments fractionalizing means you're buying pieces of it i don't don't mean to patronize that is basically what it means um what is labs first 10 10 they're using the same fractionalization allows investments to become more accessible eliminating the barrier of high investment minimum investment the average retail investor can access can access real estate investment products uh previously offered to qualified institutional oh cool so it's it's basically derivatives so it's enabling retail investors to have access to the same um in real estate products offered to institutional buyers and accredited investors that's actually okay not sure if many people will see necessarily the point of that but actually this could be the uncovering of another trend investors will be able to invest in real estate worldwide and fractional shares and of course the blockchain will act as the the um well you know the ledger for that the legal document and also you can use it for lending security exchange oh wow so this will probably partner up with um convergence i imagine labs governance access priority access oh cool cool priority access with lower price to real estate investments what can you imagine that if that was the token utility but essentially you are able to get lower prices for real estate investments now as a person that is doing a lot of real estate investing i gotta say that that does sound quite attractive however you will essentially own fractions of a building somewhere it could be cool but at the same time i don't know patrick tang patrick tang is from v chain isn't he i may be wrong not v chain yeah v chain hold on let me just have a look yeah yeah he is why is he not on there then so he's founder of a ceo of player which was a v chain um online gaming yeah i thought that was him university of san francisco university of san francisco so why hasn't he put v chain on here but anyway he's managing partner of um labs that's pretty cool let me just have a look and see if labs is uh being invested in by any venture capitalists i know that um gbv are in them there's quite a few labs so labs group hmm can't find it i don't know how to find it actually where was i was it in here street light believers shout out to mick and enzo advices box mining what a dude rio d5 rio d5 seem to be quite strong with them ah here we go so here are their partners pools oh okay so they probably don't have genesis block ventures hmm interesting okay maybe it's not as strong as i thought unless oh no sorry here we go investors so partners is purely the crypto or blockchain projects they're working with so gbv plutus well gbv seemed like the only one and um box hmm i did talk to box about them but i wasn't i just wasn't sold on it um 2020 2020 2021 so rio blah blah usa hmm it could be okay it's a new one you never know if um property property fractional property ownership will become a thing so it might be a good one if you get the right price but uh yeah interesting interesting um right okay so any other sphinx any other sphinx can you sing us your best crypto banger oh who knows who knows what's that what would i say was the best one i've ever done [Music] hmm i don't know they will escape me right now i think paul's is a great ideo launch pad moon beam boom beam soon on pools let me have a look at that if that is the case i'm buying it today if that is the case i'm buying it today let me have a look because i am in the moon beam i know i'm not in the moon beam let me just have a look and see if moon beam are actually launching on can't find it um bear with me two seconds because this could be quite important let me see if i can access the moonbeam telegram group everybody if you can do the crypto that's a good one everybody if you can do the crypto no everybody if you can do the superman oh yeah we are got it got a good one there um right here they are if they are on pools will there be a pre-sale blah blah blah no no no yeah yeah yeah pulls when grandma finally launches will it be done pools they've not actually answered that which platform will you be using to to launch glimmer token whether it be pog star or pools there is no idea in the plans apparently from the moderator okay no so we don't know essentially we don't know how they are going to launch we don't know how they're going to launch but it does not seem like it will be with pools if it is god can you imagine that would be insane breathe the pressure you'll play my game i'll test you psychosomatic and i can see you right any other questions i think i've gone through everything that i said i was going to go through oh there was another one wasn't there er something for other er energy e equals m c squared oh yeah this on federal reserve looked it already um yeah don't care 121 mil that's um okay so any other questions any other questions you've got me you got me i'm free right now no other distractions so any other questions you just make sure i have gotten through all of the super chats and i think that i think i have yeah so any super chats anything anything put it down now graph it's already too far gone what's the point hold on let me just get on to a oh on 60k get in see us here okay sir network thank you renee that's a good one sir network is actually um on a lot of the venture capitalists that i've just gone through a lot of their their lists let me just have a look at this decentralized data so it's about like crust but like um a cache decentralized data and finance cloud for enterprise backed by wow man look backed by binance arrington fenbushi alphabet kinetic ld capital ngc au21 woodstock see um gfs good effing i don't know why he said effing but then actually did swear next but so you play the mind boggles when it comes to superman okay so don't try and understand me just enjoy just enjoy the experience essentially so anyway um quite a this quite a big front page isn't it i don't know how they're launching okay so delivering fast track compute oh man delivering fast track consumer enterprise adoption so this is like a v chain competitor as well working with this already have millions of loyal users next gen snowflake establishes a more secure first party data foundation in the cloud pioneering sas data d5 better utilize sideline capital oh wow and here's polka dot it's polka dot pogba inspired next-gen distributed network layer 1 enterprise chains layer 2 private wow and then an application layer i imagine distributed apps open data place marketplaces wow sir tech lead at twitch and amazon kevin previously head of marketing who ob head of pr multiple finance backed projects early at bibo early at bibo  um founding member of the sas defile our alliance inaugural members aspirant smart change center network lron matic chain link plasma there's no way there's no way you'll be able to get into this like und under 100 million i wouldn't have thought there'll be no way there's no way sir convergence moon beam are three of the strongest oh and akala network are three of the four of the strongest projects ever um they're going to be sure 100 x's they're going to be short 100 x's so there we are people launch pool i've looked at not bad but then again not great moonbeam or ser oh good question patrick um still moonbeam still moonbeam by a mile actually um but this is a very close second moon beam and then this yeah and then convergence probably um and then a carla super years ago i watched your first video and you were broke and had issues with these community of hackers long road until today's status congrats is the video now gone as well is this video now gone as well i don't know what you mean um but thank you very much for the kind kind words fmta what's your thoughts on unique one yeah that looks quite interesting was um nfts wasn't it matchy matchy that's like a combination of matcha tea um matchy that's half seven matchy well half seven my time anyway coin gekko gekko dude [Music] key tango what the is that key tango what name is that matchy matchy matte chicks my chicks i'm just calling in my crib with my chicks 15.8 three it's a it's quite a lot to one thirteen to one maybe ratio alas isn't that good it's ethereum and fts so not great 25 percent confidence uh lack of confidence uh how long has this been out it's been our ages it's been out like what eight months um let's have a look matcha tea matches collective of artists and patrons curating and trading digital art there's so many of these now i'm surprised this didn't do well earlier i guess it's because they didn't concentrate on violent smart chain maybe um artists sean chen dude lush what is this um tiger king that's half decent that's not quite a half decent painting actually australian street artist lush is the first world's first and therefore best meme artists over 1 million followers cool i mean i think all the all the nft platforms are trying to get like some superstars because a it leads to um great sales like they what every nft platform is going to be looking for getting the best sale of an item that will give them like it's almost like an auction house it gives them like the the kudos um at the moment bondly is the ones that have that seem to have probably the best um credentials so far in that space but this could be good for speculation three million that's pretty good for speculation but there are a lot the market's saturated with nfts just like they were saturated with um yield farms shitty yield farms as well i want to see what this key tango is because it sounds quite no it's not even there is ki tango on here what why say it if it's not even oh there it is ki tango that sounds funny ki tango one million volume what's the how long has this been out anyway oh come on oh come on i'm guessing it's just out or something because there's no data whatsoever maybe it's on here oh is that right let's see if they got market cap no and how long has it been out 24 hours um yeah this has just come out essentially let's have a look and see what this is is that tango from tango and cash is that what that is because that looks like kurt russell key tango is comprised of three layers discover and learn today you know wrestling tango so discover learn invest key tango's platform free to invest discover and invest in deep d5 such yield liquidity or the other our team consists of mit y combinator really and enigma mpc alumni we are proud to be backed by outlier ventures who's out let's have a look at key tango that sounds quite fun um i've been on flipping ages ki tango oh it's on here outlier ventures they're the only ones who who else have outlier ventures invested in none i've never heard of d well dear evanim um fetch ai iota ocean a couple of good ones but anyway no they don't look that great that's probably not the best people to be backed by but at least it's better than nothing um derivatives nfts games let's do that one yeah this is like an inactive ethereum address i don't really care nothing's happening why continue but anyway it seems like it's got quite um oh here we are oh cool oh cool i like that your next venture should be that's wicked i like this um let me have a look and see the that's pretty awesome i kind of like that i haven't seen any other platforms doing something similar so apologies if i sound way too excited about something that may not be exciting to others key tango um so if you're in the kitango telegram say hi um circulating 2.45 million um okay so that makes it about what five million then [Music] yeah five million five million for key tango um interesting i kind of like it it's not really gone anywhere yet but it is starting from quite a high position i would probably be looking for it to um i'd probably be looking for it to be more like 400 000 if i was going to get into it let me just have a look and see if they've actually got any team member team members sergeant ferry says hi um uh make a million bucks oh key tango was an idea on duck starter nice nice i'm in your area oh the area i'm in your area no information on team except for the fact that it seems to have been made by clever people uh can you take a look at cyberfi loving sunday church tonight thanks father super excellent people if you haven't yet please do subscribe just so you don't miss out on any future videos because even if my old old um channel comes out i'm not coming back to it this is it this is the home of money making uh look at cyber fight i think i have looked at cyber fight actually it's funny to think that something as low as 555 rank is still 29 mil that's ridiculous like it used to be the case that you probably find about maybe 200 000 at this level but now it's 29 million market caps quite insane brief the pressure you'll play my game i'll test ya psychosomatic and it can see him come on um oh oh oh oh it's magic you know i remember this crap um this is a horrible website anyway not necessarily crap platform um d5 intelligent automation platform enhancing the default experience why cyberfi user friendly new layer features multi multi-chain will enable users to create cross-chain automated complex event scenarios yeah it's not my thing at all um right relate now safe moon i've seen that banded about a bit let me have a look at safe move seriously 22.7 it's dumped hard and i'd almost say rightly so without meaning to sound mean um let's have a look see what it is i haven't actually looked at it so let's have a look let's have an lw aka a lucky work [Music] quick swap i'll have a look at that in a minge i mean a minute oh man what okay that's why it's probably gone down because it's a bowl of bricks a pile of  so have yourself some treasure flakes um i'm gonna look at two more so i'm gonna look up one more suggestion and i'm gonna look at one more whale token lindsay coyne will rock it to a billion pounds probably uh quick swap let's have a look at quickie quickie swap i bet you any money it probably is if it's anything under 200 or something come on 25 mil trade volume oh it's 40 million quick swap is is i think i think that um ideally ideally you'd get in a better price level but it's it's i think this is going to be pretty big um there's a lot of competition in the space but but quicksort teams seem to be winning a lot of the the wins to be able to to get into these these um binance smart chain dapps uh right okay so let's have a look at one more why did i say it hi super would you sell half of ada roon srm what's that so half of aida 30k roon srm 5k or full positions 500 on uni swap dot link air wave to buy happy c c g mu refinable i won't put mute into the same category as those but um i would never sell a full position unless i really didn't didn't want it anymore um so i would if if i still had belief that something had a lot of legs because this this this all season is going to explode like where are we now it's going to explode it's going to max 100 definitely max 100 so 59 now it's going to definitely max 100 and you want to be making sure that you've got at least the position in the promising ones um and obviously aida i wouldn't i wouldn't say later to be honest uh i may say sell a bit of profits yeah i may sell a bit of profits um but yeah i would i would um definitely do it to get into refinable um happy and see cgg or their train guardians yeah perhaps as well depends on the entry point but refinable you're getting to a better entry point especially if you're part of the team supo initial investors come unbox make sure it happens by the way people we just need two likes come on be the first be the first to get us over 400 likes on this video let's see let's see who can do it who can do it who can do it come on come on come on come on betting ends it's not even gone over over 400 likes come on oh now it has now has shot over thank you people 409 likes i really do appreciate 415 now really appreciate your attendance peeps and i hope that you got quite a few oh yeah there's one more i need to do one more okay like i said i would ain't nobody like the one i got no one can you better i actually meant to say ain't nobody like the super man um all right god we have picked some gems haven't we in this list this list will age well believe me right okay let me go for um [Music] let's go moonwale let's go meanwhile because they're one of the most recent and they've been they've been quite good avalanche celsius orion super farm mask they've they've really hit the nail on the head with their investments but they have still got a lot of low caps they must be pretty much beginners moon whale so let's have a look and see what they've picked so they've got kudos which we looked at at the very beginning gourmet galaxy curio we looked at the other day i'm pretty sure play sent sissier um what was curio trying to remember and what is curio as well that is oh i didn't need to do that that's 1.1 is it the same here yeah less than a million but yet less than a million oh 11 000 how long has this been out oh it's been out a while it's been out over a year let's have a look at this then curio invest oh yeah i looked at this didn't i curio invest invests like a world class this is the bit car one wasn't it bit care because um this is interesting i think it is fractional quite a few people have said would you i would never get into this like the last one you know bit car was a complete up um so i would never get involved in something like that again to be honest but maybe the world's a bit more ready for it now than they were previously um right but no that i wouldn't i wouldn't go into that okay forget them forget moon whale uh um let's look at arrington because they're they're hot they're amongst the best i would say terror phantom look at that ah weave oasis fun thunder some of these are quite old wow bella protocol 79 mil now jesus never saw that coming we looked at that look at that they're old what is persistence let's have a look at persistence we've just looked at csu and that was  insane say network so let's have a look and see if we've got another belter here god knows probably going to be a massive like polka star to say or something stupid dark matter i looked at that the other day look absolutely wank but then sharp like 200 percent oh man see why can't some of the websites that people ask me to look at look like this like it's just you know it's a dog when you see most of the websites but like you look at sir and you look at um persistence and just looks great you just want to invest in it just look sleek building an ecosystem as financial products serve institutional and crypto native users and xr xprt what is our focus decentralized finance enabling users to interact with both traditional and digital assets in an open global context does that mean derivatives like synthetic assets non-functional tokens proof of stake creating products to generate opportunities and address challenges who are around the proof of knowledge what are we building comdex decentralized commodities trading yes so they are pretty much doing that audit.1 staking as a service liquid staking hello asset mantle is p lend debt financing who's backing us arrington woodstock au 21 ngc three commas i'm not as hot on this they look like they're creating some big oh alameda as well they look like they're creating some big products commodities change things i think really to showcase what their technology can do but i'm not as i'm not as keen on this one we've raised 3.7 million in funding so that means it's already going to be quite a high market cap matic times persistence stake matic and what can you already earn it then let me just make sure this because i'm pretty sure this isn't out um xprt no um so you can already earn it can you because if you can that's pretty that's pretty good steak drop if you can already earn it early earlier in the process fifty thousand uh will be distributed to matic stakers during the massive street uh okay okay that wasn't quite what i was expecting um persistence is an interoperable protocol built to facilitate the creation of next gen financial this is like a modern day one chain basically modern day one chain this is what one chain could have been essentially using the features of define utilizing nfts to tokenize real world assets nice i love it i love it i love it right right that one's not out yet so let's have a look at just one more that is out potentially what's your opinion on vid crap is what my opinion is um duh duh duh um let's try woodstock actually let's try woodstock if i can find them how did i not i may not have saved it oh that's a shame i was quite looking forward to looking at woodstocks okay let's just have a look at one more though um i'm trying to remember what ones we haven't looked at should we look at delta hub okay so they invested in elrond reef anchor so they're definitely quite modern um yield app stp constellation  but won't go chain this old endor rio bonded sent or sent or lattice they've gone these guys are definitely more into the lower lower um standard decent defy like not the premier league they're not bad they're not great but not bad they go into union glitch glitch has gone up quite a bit actually recently fire e money all right so let's pick out we've looked at nord we've looked at kira we haven't looked at centaur there's 21 mil let's have a look at centaur anyway i wonder how many of you guys have actually i've looked at vidt um i wonder how many of you guys uh have actually been here from beginning to end would vote for super to create fun pools i would love to yeah i i've actually thought about doing so i've actually created thought about creating the hit factory um that would be my fun's name um simply because that is what we are uh but um yeah i don't think it's quite as um quite as easy as it sounds but uh centaur utilizes semi constructing this makes no sense to me lending asset management digital payments these smart contracts have community members to stake funds prior liquidity protocol agnostic decentralized oracles a decentralized network of oracles will provide cross-chain data fees through a simplified consensus procedure it's powered by tendermint core process this is still in test now which is pretty cool oh wait hold on what's last year um launch of main there launch of lending platform for the uk and eu our partners i've got quite a few good partners seems alright actually yeah it seems all right without really knowing what the hell it does other than just oh bridging defying the traditional finance so i'm guessing it's a little bit like um alliance block yeah i'm guessing it's a little bit like alliance block um but they're not exactly brilliant with their descriptions their marketing is utter um super how many how do you manage to stay calm for the long term for cash out major gains uh because because if i believe in them long term then i know they're going to achieve 100x it'll just be a matter of time so uh that's that's how i stake up yeah stay calm getting a bulletproof entry points and ride it um the thing is is because i've made so many wins like i don't really like i don't know i don't feel the losses so bad anymore um either connecting all the major dex coins thank you very much db for the 99 1999 um ah either swap right okay okay all the major dex coins if bnc and dot exclusive nft aren't for the people who stayed there either yes you can save your coins only 5 000 coins 3 500 great super chat because you've actually put the supply which i'll take your word for it 3500 circulating holy 3 000 a coin that [Music] um i'm not interested in that potentially let me have a look exclusive nftr i hate the price i wouldn't bother getting in decentralized asset management volts gain swap nothing amazing there decentralized launch pad raised capital nft platform integral part bad actually not bad bit pricey though well i mean like i just i just wouldn't bother buying it that's my own personal perspective i think it kind of puts retail investors out no one no one it seems from the whale world in there uh yeah probably do well in coin season but i'm not massively into that i don't think so let's have a quick look at the road map so we got that the decks next quarter launch pad yeah it might be might be worth getting in speculatively but i hate the price price price price of right people i think that is it let me just see if there's any general oh hold on oh that's fine let me see if there's any generalistic questions cardiac chain it's too expensive not interested um uni decks looked at that already today haven't i oh there was one i wanted to look at gather oh it's really 37 mil let's have a look at gaba everybody if you can do the part man no it's everybody if you can do the super man a new way for businesses to monetize online gather as a platform now it's published to monetize without ads and provides business okay so this sounds like no isn't expensive no one likes that number of miners a solution gather online gather enterprise gather cloud we had our web and mobile developers monetize to monetize that's stupid i hate when people make dumb thank you very much rish richette for all you do and just for being a nice guy i really appreciate that that's lovely of you um let me just have a look and see gather gather gather multi-layered protocol trg is that it i'm sure i saw more than that in there [Music] yeah transparent secure yeah i don't think i'll bother now just seeing as though um it's only trg and it's 37 million already right any other questions peeps literally last minute last minute court chain cautions dead them they're dead i sold it like three years ago they dumped on their on their um retail investors not interested at all can you check out bifrost i'm sure i tried to add that and it wouldn't let me fmta let me have a look at fmta then fundamentally no no point the 16k i've spent more than that today that's stupid um i've looked at this it's utter [Music] um this give oh 76k at um six million that's utter cancer okay i think that's it people i think that is it um one last question super are all your watch list coins backed by these investors before you post them what do you mean are you all your watch list coins which ones do you mean the ones that are actually um the venture capital list list or my list because if so then yeah i mean they get involved at seed stage that's how the information um is on the app a checked hive i guess you probably weren't here at the beginning super what is your favorite nft project hmm i'll tell you something i kind of liked i'm not sure i would invest in it but i kind of liked this little site here i don't get i don't get what you mean if my list like my list can be a mix of i don't know hold on maybe it wasn't d fight maybe it wasn't dot i o i was d five filter finance like um it's a mixture of some are some aren't but i tend to go with them i don't like this d5 ville yeah i kind of like it i like quite a few to be fair um probably a gotchy is my favorite superhero legend thank you very much sebastian i really appreciate that and will make us all rich your thoughts about juice yeah i think i think that's the um i think the ship sailed on that one i'm afraid my microcut list is like it's a bit of both like it's got some it's not it's also some don't have it um let's see uh yeah some most of them have got venture capitalists not all of them that's why you need to make sure that you research and that's why you should use the whale app yourself um like for instance the one i did the other day decentralized oracles that has not got any whales in it um yeah i didn't give a honestly forget quark chain i hate it those guys are sharks i couldn't be less interested if you tried um what's the whale app you have to go to my d5 course like i've said this course here um yeah this course here you will find out who it where where to find it and how to use it um how do i look to convergence yes uh anyway i think that is it i think we're coming to an end unfortunately um so anyway yes so bear with me just two seconds once again just need to quickly swap c swap accounts no no oh yeah sorry sorry yeah um yes so um that's it people that is it for today's video so i really have to say i appreciate all of you for sticking around um it's been excellent and there have been quite a few that have been looked at and at the very least uncovered so that you yourself can see if you even if i didn't like it that you may want to get into it and you've also looked at what i look for when i am looking to make a large play or a large stake or investment in a particular cryptocurrency you've gone through my entire process so thank you all for being here mass is over god what is it three hour mass let me just have a look yes three hours that is quite possibly well probably one of the biggest longest masses you may have been to in your whole entire life but it's a mess of goodness the collection plate has gone round a lot of you guys have contributed it and a lot of likes were received as well so i really appreciate you all for being here remember to smash the like um on this video and subscribe if you haven't yet um because you know

"JVwrqs_z0h0": "hey guys rich here welcome back to the rc informer youtube channel got steve on the camera and it is time to take a stand uh you guys have seen we've had multiple stands on the you know our videos things we've used and i'm here to show you another one uh real similar the ones we've already been showing you that uh is really kind of one of the best stands around but this one actually is coming from banana hobby this is the blitzard c works brand steve if you can get in on the the logo here um this is their brand of another really great stand that i've been using for a long time um the only difference on this one really is is that it seems to have a really wider stance for bigger models like it's less likely to kind of tip over and then the other thing is is uh steve if you want to get right here there's like a lot of extra foam padding in the tips it seems like so you know you don't ding things up with the aluminum thing sticking out so so they they they sit really far out like that and it'll hold it's really designed for kind of bigger models which we're going to have a lot of bigger models on a channel coming here to show you guys and of course it has this really nice kind of d-shaped design and then steve if you can get in kind of zoom in on this part right here yep can you get it on that the teeth are really have a nice positive lock so when you undo this you can change the height of this thing to almost anything you want so you know you can have it tall and thin for a short uh airplane for a shorter model or something and then you can also lock them in and it's a real positive lock and you know you can go kind of real low with it for a longer model and uh you know it's good indoors it's good outdoors me and steve are constantly having this using these things and now like i could never have enough of these i only had one but now i got a couple of them to use and they come in so many colors so you know you guys can check them out at banana hobby in the description below they've got multiple colors red blue like this gold i think silver they maybe have a purple but just check out the links in the description below for that and what i'll do is we're going to do an actual kind of live unboxing assembly of one of these so you guys can see uh see how really nice this is you know stay tuned if i hadn't had them out already we're gonna have some videos out um on the osprey too which we did a live on and it's uh i got an unboxing assembly so check that out on the channel as well and uh we got one here in the box new to kind of show everybody just so we can kind of run through run through what this is and we can all take a look at it i think i just cut myself with that let's see yeah i snagged my finger just a little bit but that's okay gotta you gotta be careful playing with knives steve you know what the heck so here's what you get with this thing um just take a look at it this way everybody can see that's basically how it comes you got uh you got the top foam padded parts you've got your you got your legs here you've got um the feet there we'll put this aside and then somewhere in here is a bunch of screws let's see there's a little bag of screws so we'll unbag all this the wind is not going to cooperate with us here today but we'll do our best with the uh i think if we landed across one right we ought to be able to assemble something in a crosswind so get these things out of here nice foam padded again guys you choose your color here let me get this in there so then i'll blow away uh the legs are real nice here let's see uh let's see that might be gone all right here we go get these all out of the bag and show you guys this real time but again you can see here how nice these are you can see they're all locked in i would recommend and i don't have my screwdriver with me but check the tightness of these two screws you want to make sure that those are secure same with these okay and just make sure they're tight before you put them together but essentially this is really all you have so uh probably the easiest way to put this together is just kind of lock these in somewhere and then through your little bag here which i'll go ahead and i'll open this up and uh let's see we'll get these out of here and we'll show you what you have in here you've got this little you know your little uh kind of locking knob there and then you've got a bunch of screws and there they are they're all hex screws and i am using a two and a half millimeter to put those uh put those things together so um so we'll take this i'll just throw this in here first tighten this baby up it should screw down pretty nice and uh get that going and then we'll just stick the legs on now steve this will get it so you can get in there and see how nice this is can you can you see that okay yep those just fit right together okay they snap in and then you just put uh put two screws in there so you know with your two and a half millimeter here if i did get the right size that should get us uh should get us in place let's uh get that thing to tap in there there we go we just get uh get those all together so there's two in each one and really the long and short of it is is you get the two legs on you get your two top pieces on we'll just show you one going on here complete and so you guys can get the gist of that just make sure they're nice and tight you can even check the security of these down here we'll get that in and then i'll just pop these on see how nice that uh it's a very tight fit but that's what you want you want it to be pretty pretty darn snug so we'll put that in place and i have this set to be really kind of kind of tall so we'll widen this up okay and then your others should go on just the same right here it's a nice d shaped tube in fact let me get in on that see the d shape to the tube yep okay and that's that's how they're they're actually a little stronger i think than an actual just regular kind of tube design but that goes in and that goes in as well you just put the remainder of the screw so there's really only eight screws to get this thing uh that this thing together and that's that's as easy as it is so anyway guys just to bring you a great product this thing is awesome um and we've been using this stand and the other stand or our red one now we have two more to kind of add because i usually use two or three of these in the shop but uh but really nice outstanding item coming from uh you know banana hobby and their blitz rc work so check it out there below steve you got anything dad i'm taking that one home yeah steve's gonna take one of these from you know that's how he is he takes all my stuff so but anyway yeah nice stands guys i use them all oh and one more thing too uh let me see if i can do this without this might blow away um one thing to note too is the cool thing is is these do and i might have showed this before actually you know what instead of doing that with this let's do it with this one since i didn't assemble that fully thing is about these two is when you want to transport it they fold flat so you can get them locked in see the teeth it's like designed specifically that they'll lock in so you can transport it you know just really easy and flat i think this in my trailer actually against one of the walls and it just kind of stays there so real easy to operate positive lock with the teeth that are there very adjustable and just uh really really a nice thing so anyway guys check these out coming to a banana hobby they're there now check the links below please guys like and subscribe to the channel we'll have new stuff coming um and uh hit that notification bell and uh we do appreciate you guys watching morris coming we'll see you guys next time [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] you", "tv8Z0xUUJ5Y": "hello and uh welcome to my video uh today i'm talking ac dc on friday the 13th ac dc released this album uh power up i got this exclusive vinyl from walmart that is a cool red color it's pretty sick i got the cd as well and i had that in my car i didn't get the uh deluxe box set that uh was released but uh had i known about it i probably would have bought that as well my favorite song as of right now is one called code red uh there's just something about that opening guitar riff i love it it's ac dc and uh if you're like me you know a lifelong fan of ac dc um you should check it out and uh i mean when i say lifelong fan i mean he'll i've still got their their cassette tapes up here on my shelf anyway the first and only time i've seen ac dc was in 2009 and it was on the black ice tour this album right here they played magnetic hill in new brunswick here in canada and uh it was by far the biggest uh audience i'd ever been a part of something around like 85 000 people massive massive uh crowd of people and uh ac dc that night of course this switch was on um i think what even what made it even more special was the fact that uh it was the original lineup in all all original members of course malcolm young was still alive and uh great show memorable one of the highlights for sure of my concert going experiences and i have been to many concerts but anyway what i really want to discuss today are these guys right here so you're looking at is a pair of ac dc converse which back in 2009 prior to going to see ac dc i saw these in a store and i had to buy them for the concert so i wore these for the first time ever at an ac dc concert recently noticed these shoes for sale on ebay asking hundreds of dollars i'm like wow are they really that rare and are they really that worth it well i can tell you this i have had these shoes since 2009 and not only have i worn these for that ac dc concert i have worn them for every concert since and believe me in in the matter of 11 years i've seen a  ton of concerts and uh i was wearing these the whole time so when i met the guys in metallica i was wearing these when i met john five from rob zombie i was wearing these not only are these my concert going shoes but anytime i go anywhere and do any uh distant traveling these are my traveling shoes and to emphasize more on on that when i say travel i mean i walked across the golden gate bridge in san francisco and i was wearing these i walked las vegas boulevard i was wearing these i toured alcatraz i um you know i walked along the grand canyon the whole time wearing these these these are my my weapons of choice when i need footwear to travel and uh i mean 11 years old they're uh they're in pretty good shape you know i don't think uh converse have released any uh shoes like this since i know uh i think vans are now releasing a shoe with the highway to hell album cover because that's what this is highway to hell the album cover but uh yeah i mean for them to be worth hundreds of dollars um okay i guess so but uh i tell you these are worth more than that these are worth more than any any amount of money for me you know like i said i wore these when i visited um stephen king's house i wore these when i visited graceland and i will continue to wear these if i have anywhere to go i will be wearing my ac dc chuck taylor's converse anyways guys i felt like talking about ac dc with the release of the new album and uh i just wanted to discuss my my um devotion i want to say to ac dc and uh yeah how i've rocked these shoes throughout the years and i still plan on rocking them some more all hell yeah like comment subscribe thanks so much for watching hope to see you all in the next video so [Music] almost forgot i also wore these when i went to see the evil dead musical and i sat in the splatter zone they gave us these white

song says it all alright here we go [Music] [Applause] wow [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] one [Music] cause [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Laughter] [Applause] oh [Music] [Music] down may god bless is [Applause] yeah that was off the chain man see that's what i'm talking about guys i know y'all talk about things about folks having uh you know the studio version and all that but you see what i'm saying being able to look at him doing what he's doing seeing the facial expressions it's so crazy because if you are switching between breast and bottle to go smoothly our natural bottle this is weird y'all a commercial came up [Laughter] excuse the commercial came up with a bottle that has a texture and movements and feeling of a boob and that threw me for anyway love this man absolutely love this yes workout playlist to the fullest now i'm not gonna sit in front and act like i heard everything he said so i know this in this case i am gonna go and listen to the studio version and see what this is about but just what i was saying is that being able to see them live doing this stuff seeing the drummers and gets it all into it the guitarist and all them seeing him just push his stuff out making those facial expressions that's what i love about it see i don't get that same feeling the sensation from just hearing the studio version without seeing it performing that's why i told you i love a lot of live stuff i love to see people turn their mouth a certain way and do things like that you know what i'm saying i don't know maybe it's just me anyway thanks for another workout genre song because it's warm outside now and i'm definitely gonna be out there a whole lot more now love the gym but doing stuff like outside there's nothing like it anyway absolutely love this love this 100 playlist teresa anderson thank you for this one sis everybody else y'all should know what to do by now right y'all know what to do right yeah we're gonna see i'm ty smith model renaissance man hoping it printed every last one of you have food shelter and clothing and most of all i hope and prayer realize when you guys are in great health god bless you through jesus what is going on folks appreciate you guys watching do me a favor if you're trying to get to the next reaction video that i did after this video it's right

maybe last spm biology in your life maybe not last biological definitely last spm biology class so how are you guys feeling today are you guys excited for tomorrow to be over hopefully that i think you guys are loud okay since today's chinese paper and for those who don't think chinese you had like six days to study biology so hopefully that you guys fully utilize the six days that you had because it's only last day today so hopefully that you guys have really studied well okay hi for those who i didn't say hi just now hi guys hi who is potato so cute the name potato toto oh my god so cute how young carson kent okay hi guys hi hi guys hello um we will start in like maybe three or four minutes time we will let people to come in first you know malaysian timing they don't come in early they always come in late and hopefully that it will not be a heavy rain later on because it will be like a very heavy thunderstorm later hi guys hello okay so um actually for today class strike i really hope that you guys had really studied everything already so because this is just like a quick revision uh i'll be doing larker paper too because initially i was planning to do pinning paper but i think the opinion people is a bit similar to mris them at spp so i didn't i didn't like choose peeling paper i chose like malacca paper to do it okay so blocker paper has a lot of various different kind of question actually like different kind of questions teacher can you speak a little bit of chinese like you know what yes it is okay hey guys very tired want to sleep plus raining also guys don't sleep one last paper me unless you are taking unless they are taking uh it comes next week then it's different oh my god it's buying biology oh my god it's brighter food so excited cheer my away oh my god please don't rain so soon feature can't rap today i really want to wrap today mean i want to go in a faster speed because if i still go in a very slow speed uh i think the cars will end like 10 o'clock uh hope that the cars will end before night because to finish the entire paper we need about two and a half hours so hopefully that we can end before night so you can study the rest of it so for those who haven't watched how to answer paper tree you can go watch at my youtube channel because i actually teach the answering technique to to answer paper tree which is section eight and section beta so for those who haven't watched and watched here okay here also remaining here really oh no hopefully that pj don't rain yet okay i already heard the thunder strong because when it being shine then you guys will heard hear that actually the the brain pain drops i don't know maybe hopefully that the mic is not that good i don't know whether but then now i have to use i have to like want the mic to work better or don't work better explain this using some chinese guys don't worry my english is not very good i use the very basic english to to explain okay really don't understand my english or the part itself i will try to use some chinese to explain because uh i have a lot of students who don't understand mandarin actually my own student so i have to find a middle point i will use a very basic very very basic english to to explain everything okay so in two more minutes we're gonna start we're gonna start at 605 so for those i haven't print the paper yet please go and print it out okay go go go and print the paper um same thing i actually i uploaded the paper uh with one of my own version because i don't like the messy kind of chives paper so i typed the entire paper out already so if you prefer the one that i typed you can print the one that i've typed so you don't have any any printer at home you can use your own paper please guys write it down today okay for the one last time one thing last time please write the things down because if you don't write and you only just listen right i don't think that you will be able to remember what you have learned today please write everything that whatever i write please write okay whatever i don't write you can also write okay please write uh if you don't change your brain at least i train your hand a bit so today is the last time that your hand will feel like breaking because my student always say that attending my class it feels like the hand will break into half so yeah hopefully that you guys will feel the same today your pain you'll feel like you you write a lot of words today and hopefully that the one that you learned today will come out tomorrow i want to say it's the same thing but hopefully it's similar thing that it will come out okay okay so you can also share with your friends that you can also share with your friends that who take biopaper because it's really the last time already like the last last last last time of biology in their life if they really need help you know some of the students are very pro they don't need help it's okay okay so if you really need help then you can share with your friends and the video can be replayed anyway but i don't think that you have any time to replay the video i don't think that you have time to replay the video so you ask a friend to come in like okay just ask a friend to join the live class everyone can learn together at the same time your first time watching live okay welcome guys okay we're gonna start right now oh no i heard the thunderstruck oh no no no no okay it's okay i think that you guys will you guys hear my voice very well right i mean dislikes the thunderstruck the voice okay right i mean like that is the background but my voice is the main one is my voice okay right right right right okay do you recommend going through pressure and scan mark quickly enough you mean what you mean you mean like uh like now for blocker people will be doing together so it's okay okay so okay good so let's start the class now okay because the the reply time is a bit slow so i don't think that i can wait for a reply anyway okay so this is marker 2020 paper two okay 1.1 shows the cross section of leave on the green plan so let's look at this one this is actually form four chapter two but at this part right you have sponge chapter two and also form four chapter six so i will also be teaching from chapter six in question one as well you it says name structure p and structure q at the same time p is the upper part of the leaf so obviously that p will be the fp jeremy is okay p will be fp that means and then we have q right q is a one arranged closely so obviously that q is a paralysis mesophyll cell okay palisade mesophyll cell so basically we already have the labeling for p and q next what it says green plants produce food through the process of photosynthesis explain the adaptation of structure cure to increase the rate of photosynthesis in this question what they asked we asked about what photosynthesis so obviously that what do you think gas m is guessing is the one that goes into the plant right so in order to carry out photosynthesis what do you need obviously you need carbon dioxide obviously you need carbon dioxide right so they ask you to explain adaptation of structure q okay now when it comes to structured cure palliative muscle fuel cell carry out photosynthesis besides using carbon dioxide and water what do they need they also requires chloroplasts so palliative mesophyll cell characteristic is what they arrange closely and it contains high density of chloroplasts so when you have high density of copper plus it means that you can absorb more sunlight to increase more photosynthesis so you expect your answer is it has a large amount of chloroplast okay so you can see it absorb more sunlight that increases rate of photosynthesis exam tomorrow please don't write ropr because i just want to be faster so rate of photosynthesis that produces more glucose and oxygen okay more glucose and oxygen so this is the answer for cube so just so we already know what it is guess mri because as i mentioned in order to carry out photosynthesis you need uh carbon dioxide water and coral plugs so it says guess m is needed for green plants to undergo process of photosynthesis explain the effect of increasing concentration of gas and in weight of photosynthesis okay when you have more carbon dioxide okay when you have more carbon dioxide obviously that rate of photosynthesis will also increase why okay for those who don't know well about photosynthesis and you haven't watched the video yet it's okay we're going to go through again for photosynthesis so for photosynthesis we have two parts okay let me erase this part because i want to write here so we have two parts we have light reaction and we have that reaction light reaction and that reaction so two different process we have two different name right like reaction it is known as photolysis of water that reaction required as reduction of carbon dioxide reduction of carbon dioxide so we have two in order for you to know how to expand you must be able to understand what does photo of photolysis of water means photo means like lysis means breakdown so that's why they break down water molecule with the presence of light so water it will be broken down into two ions which is h plus h plus and oh minus so actually before they carry out this light reaction right they will carry out a thing where the light is absorbed by what it is absorbed by the coral field so over here you can wrap it up because i think that photosynthesis it has a very high chances of coming out so please wreck it down at least you can increase your muscle memory or whatever so absorb by chlorophyll black is absorbed by chlorophyll so it excites molecule of floral fill to higher energy until it release energy to form atp okay now what is the importance of atp as a photosynthesis if the plant i mean if the coral field cannot release any atp right they will not have a complete photosynthesis atp is then used in that reaction later on so they must release atp in order to have a overall process of photosynthesis so again as i mentioned photolysis of water means what you break down water with the presence of sunlight right it will break down into two ions so first we have water breakdown into o h minus and h plus remember o h minus is not known as a hydroxide ion it is known as the hydroxyl ion because this is biology not chemical hydroxyl ion and h plus obviously required as hydrogen ion so oh minus and h plus they have a charge i don't want them to have a charge what can i do i can release which is loses electron or can i can also receive electron so if it's a minus obviously it means they will lose because minus i don't want to lose electron so when they lose electron whereas the electron goes to the electrons it will goes to the chlorophyll loses electron to chlorophyll to chlorophyll okay so when it loses electron there's no more charge if there is no more charge what do they actually become they will become into a thing called o h group hydroxyl group hydroxyl group it will combine together to form into two products the first product will be oxygen the next product will be water but obviously oxygen is the main product why because oxygen needs to be released to the atmosphere to carry out cellular respiration by organism so if they if you want to explain the o2 you can actually say that a release to atmosphere for cellular respiration hopefully that you guys already know what is the cellular respiration uh because this one is like four four chapter four kind of hormone chapter two kind of thing and also information you'll learn the same so since we have done with light reaction we must go to that reaction how do you start that reaction because it's a reduction of carbon dioxide co2 it means in this sequence here it requires carbon dioxide so from h plus because plus it has charge right i i don't want them to have charge i want them to be stable so over here i will receive receive electron so as i receive electron the h plus it will form into hydrogen atom so this hydrogen atom they will combine with carbon dioxide to form into glucose and water but obviously that glucose is the main product water is the side product so glucose events condense oh yeah yeah use the wrong color but then oh my god okay so glucose they will condense into starch and store in plural plus okay and stored in coral plus so this is like and that reaction please please please remember this one uh i don't know whether i should hope this question come out or not because every year there will be a plant question if it's not this one then it will be oxy in i don't wanna you'll go through oxygen it's only later as well so this is light and dark reaction if you want to write an overall equation for photosynthesis it will be water plus carbon dioxide with the presence of light energy or sunlight and chlorophyll to form into glucose c6h12o6 plus oxygen how do i get this equation from this equation comes from light and dark reaction because what light reaction it is known as what it is known as photolysis of water so this is from light because water right what does light reaction produce it produces oxygen okay it produces oxygen then carbon dioxide right for carbon dioxide where does carbon dioxide come from carbon dioxide yeah actually come from the reaction this one also that reaction so this is the overall photosynthesis if you want to balance okay i know i missed atp okay so uh if you want to balance the equation uh don't have to balance it's okay because it's not chemistry right it's biology but if you really want to balance right shorter chemical formula you add a six in front six six six then you have a balance equation but if you don't want balance it's okay as well sometimes the question will ask you to write a chemical equation and sometimes they ask you to write word equation if it's word equation please write water instead of h2o just do something we miss atp right where does the atp the atp actually is here when hydrogen atom combined with carbon dioxide they will use atp okay this is the atp so this is the light and dark reaction for photosynthesis it sounds very important please remember guys actually if you remember the thing that you write it over here i think you should be able to wreck it into sentences but uh of course you have to pray hard for a diagram because if you have diagram you just form sentences based on the diagram that you see because there's a lot of question with diagram one so you can see that atp is here okay now anyway back to the question over here okay so obviously that when you have more carbon dioxide means well you have increase of reduction of carbon dioxide means dark reaction increases in order for you to have that reaction please remember you must have light reaction first if there is no light reaction means there will be no dark reaction so light reaction must take place first before you have that reaction again light must come first before that okay yeah now we're gonna form sentence for this so you can see that rate of carbon dioxide reduction or you can see fixation if you want to increases more dark reaction take place more carbon dioxide combined with hydrogen atom to produce glucose more carbon dioxide combined with hydrogen hydrogen atom or you can see more carbon dioxide combined with hydrogen atom with a hydrogen atom by user using atp to produce more glucose also okay if you want to write like a very complete sentence this is the answer okay now that is why we're going to move towards the next question next question requires you to draw the diagram up uh if you're drawing it's not very nice it's okay because my drawing is very bad as well but as long as the teacher understands what you draw is fine okay for example this one it says draw and labor the organelle that controls transmittation process implants okay if you want to control transpiration okay and organelle right okay draw the labor the organelle so if it's transpiration it will be the stomata so you're going to draw a stomach okay it's okay that you draw very ugly as long as you draw it's either opening also can closing of stomata also can doesn't matter opening and closing also cannot so let's say i just draw opening right okay it doesn't really matter which one that you prefer okay opening it looks very ugly okay so it draws something like a bean shape or something like that like okay and then you draw a back hole inside black hole and you talk a little bit now okay you dot dot dot to represent the cytoplasm and then you can draw some organelles if you want to like whatever organelle is it don't have to label one it's not gonna have because this one need to label sorry what do you need to label but you don't need to label the organelle you need to label the stomata and the gut cell so just labor this one as a gut cell this one as a stomata so this is the diagram that you have to draw like so you're going to draw a stomata by that they are opening or closing also can the gut sell doesn't matter if you want to drop closing i also can but my diagram is a bit not very nice i'm not very good at drawing but it's okay this one is okay already explain how the condition of the organelle in c1 during afternoon so during afternoon time okay you have to know one fact okay afternoon got sun or not obviously afternoon got stunned right we cannot expect that afternoon raining and now we have to accept we have to assume that afternoon confirmed means what god's son okay god's fun means what means they will be photosynthesis because in order to carry out photosynthesis you need sunlight right so since they carry out photosynthesis the stomata it will open why they will open is because that the gut cell itself it contains a chloroplast it contains of coral plus what does the coral plus do we know that in other choroplast is actually to carry out photo synthesis okay to carry out photosynthesis so since right now i have a lot of glucose okay i have a lot of glucose okay i have a lot of glucose it causes the gut cell to be hypertonic so since gut cell right now it's hypertonic water from the surrounding cell it will diffuse into the gut cell as they diffuses into the gut cell the gas that will open that's why during afternoon time the gut cell will open so that's why during afternoon you also increase the rate of transpiration as well means more water loss is called transpiration okay okay so we're going to expand on this color so you're going to say that the stomata open because gut style contains a horror plus that undergo photo synthesis okay they undergo photosynthesis so a lot of glucose is produce that causes gut cell to be hypertonic to surrounding cell if you do want to write surrounding cell you can write adjacent cell it means surrounding cell a neighboring cell also can like copy the cell okay neighboring cell okay to surrounding cell and then uh got one more sentence a direct it over here okay the one more sentence you can see that water diffuses into a gut cell by osmosis causes the gut cell to become clergy and bend outward or curve outward also okay bend upwards or curve outwards okay so this is how it works uh whenever they ask about photosynthesis you must know this one and also know about the greenhouse as well greenhouse you can control all the emitting factors right so you can know about that okay next question second 1.2 shows the transfer of glucose from proximal convoluted tubule into blood capillary in kidney uh actually the reason why i choose malata paper is because malacca paper is very messy okay in a way of saying that because there's a lot of question in one question one so for this one question i can explain a lot of stop topic so that's why i chose molecular paper i mean like it's too messy that i can explain a lot of things okay one point two shows the transport of proximal convoluted tubules is under kidney actually it says you have the labor one is structured experts so for structure x okay structure axa this is obviously a mitochondria with a feature i need to write hypertonic two words or two it's a same okay hypertronic two or two same okay so this is my third project and what the question asks you explain why a large number of structural eggs are found in epithelial cell of proximal convoluted tubule this one goes back to kidney question we have to understand what happens at pct of course but if you don't know never mind because the question i really say what transfer of what will cause and they give you mitochondria right so it means that in order to absorb glucose you need microchondria so obviously it is the active transport i mean if you don't know anything about kidney you can find the key words in the question itself glucose mitochondria means what effective transplant it happens at the pct but um i will go through an overall idea of the kidney for those who don't remember as well uh i have a diagram over here i know that it's not with you but you can just google whatever okay uh this is the diagram that you should understand the diagram so this is the nephrons required as nephrons so these nephrons right what do we have to know number one you have to know the labeling in order for you to answer all of the question you must know the labeling first the sequence is also very important so number one you have to know where is the global rulers woman rulers is a blood capillary within the bowman's capsule so this is the bowman's capsule the c shape and you have the gomer rulers inside it's a it's a bunch of blood capillary law okay so this blood capillary it has two endings one is efferent arterial the other one is ethereum arterial so afferent and ethereum is because there are different lumen in size one is bigger one is smaller efferent is bigger different is smaller in size so it's within the global rulers the blood capillary so vocabulary you have the starting point which is afferent arterial the ending point is ethereum arterial efferent is larger in size is bigger in size or larger in size and impairment is smaller in size okay so this is the number one part everything happens here first okay the number one part okay so this number one part right what's so important about the number one part this number one part it has the process the first process that we have to learn about kidney is ultra filtration now let me recognize ultra why it's so thick can be smaller okay let me write him ultra ultra filtration so what does ultra filtration means ultra filtration it means that it will allow certain substances from the blood capillary to diffuse into a space called glomerular space why do they have distinct because the pressure is different because afferent arterial they have a larger lumen bigger lumen and if it goes to smaller lumen right it will cause difference in the pressure the pressure required as hydrostatic pressure uh to remind you hola okay we're gonna write the sentence oh just in case tomorrow y'all don't remember again so they have hi hi hydro septic pressure it is high hydrostatic pressure is because of different five of lumen between efferent arterial and efferent arterial okay afferent arterial and efferent arthritis you can just write number one since you have no diagram right it's okay just write number one there okay ultra filtration it happens that the glomerulus and the bowman's capsule okay so since they have a high hydrostatic pressure they will force most of the fluid out from here it will goes into the space which is the capsular space so the second point if they ask you to explain you must be able to write these causes blue wheat to force out into capsular space okay but okay but there are two things cannot diffuse into it the first one is there is no red blood cell no plasma protein no red blood cell no plasma protein because they are too large but the thicker one is better i mean the pan thicker is better the thicker is better is it lucky because if it's thicker one i don't i don't know whether i can wrap like so small or not okay okay let me try the thicker one later so this is the ultra filtration so it will diffuse into it right so when it diffuses into it they are known as a glomerular filtrate okay it is known as a glomerular filtrate yeah it's on my iraqis known as bloomer ruler filtrate is it better the thicker one is it better okay so this is glomerular future now the end without charge nutrition because ultra filtration can only happens at the glomerulus okay from the guama rulers the bowman's capsule the capsular space okay so when you reach the capsular space the next part is what the next part is the proximal convoluted tubule okay i had like okay proximal convoluted tubule in short required as pct in exam can you write pct you can only write pct when you write one type of proximal convoluted tubule okay after you write the piece after you write the proximal convoluted tube this is our filtration yes this is also a mutation everything else here in red color is ultra filtration because every different part i will change color what is blood osmotic pressure i can later explain this and then we go back to the blood osmotic pressure okay now second point we're gonna goes to proximal convoluted tribute so for proximal convoluted tubules what happens here is there was a process called re-absorption okay we have re-absorption i thought i write number one two three no okay v-absorption okay re-absorption means what what do they reabsorb will we absorb five main things what are the five main things glucose amino acid and acr water and acid water glucose amino acid and acid water this is the important one but the thing is you have to know what process that takes place for example it is glucose and amino acid whether it is a simple diffusion or passive transport whether it is an active transfer or whether it is cosmosis this is the part that you have to know so for me absorption and pct this time i think about five things right all glucose and amino acid is fully reabsorbed so reabsorption is the one that goes into that goes into the blood capillary okay next one if you want to reabsorb glucose and amino acid it will be active transport because just now we mentioned my glucose mitochondria it will be active transport right so this is by active transport is the thicker pan better or just now the thinner one better you all let me know okay okay besides glucose and amino acid what else we have and ac all right so nacl is by a passive transport passive transport and then next month we have water water obviously is by osmosis feature you haven't answered my question why is the question teacher is human or plant facial logic easier to score i think it depends on what you what you what you are good at human has more thing plan quite fixed though so i cannot say between either which one is harder it depends on which one you know better okay right some people think that humans is easier some people that plants is easier so i think it's your choice okay we absorption now done with this one at pct so remember they must be fully reabsorbed of glucose and amino acid because if it's not fully reabsorbed when it goes to as a human right when the person when the person urine contains of glucose the person will have diabetes mellitus when a person urine contains of amino acid the person will have kidney failure so they must be fully re-absorbed okay fully re-absorbed next one what do we have it will goes to the look of heller i don't know what you can see here now look our pen is over here this is number three look of hell okay look up headlight so look okay they have two limbs one is descendingly monitor standing limb so ascending limb and descending limb or cupping is here okay so ascending limb and descending limb right you have to know uh may we absorb what things at these two parts okay we're gonna start with the descending limb first law okay let me write over here descending limb they will be absorbed water so if it's water remember it will be osmosis always water is or small sieve okay next one ascending limb ascending limb they will be absorbed what do you like just so we have any cl water glucose amino acids use glucose and amino acids fully we absorb uh osmosis already absorbed at the standing limb what do we have we have nacl right so we left naclo where the base of okay you cannot write salah you have to write an a or cl sodium sodium ion and uh iona so you cannot write a chemical formula okay so nacl is by this one it's active transport hey just not wrongly already guys active transport sorry sorry this one here is not passive is active this is active the cancer of activa active transport nacl is active transport okay next one we have the dct so for dc tia is number four part this number four part also be absorption so let me use other colors let me use blue color okay v and also secretion so for reabsorption at bct what do they we absorb same thing what do you left an acl water but of course you'll be absorbed nacl water but when it comes to reabsorption at this part right they will involve a hormone there are two hormones being involved the first one is adh number two is aldo steroid okay adh and aldosterone if i mix up we absorb and we absorb it okay a singular plural and whatever grammar error or whatever past tense is okay guys it's not important because it's biology feature can you teach how to sketch diagram for contrast contraction and relaxation of muscle in phone five chapter two if you have a question for that you're gonna schedule they don't ask you to sketch they ask you to finish the diagram only one if it's contract or relaxed contract means they're thicker if it's relaxing means they become smaller okay anyway um this adh hey what i say adhi is to reabsorb water okay is to reabsorb water and aldosterone is to be absorbed nacl so water is by osmosis and acl is by passive transport over here is by passive transport because the the confusing part about kidney is the nacl at the front part is active and the back part is passive so you have to know where it's activated specifically that is the tricky part about the kidney i cannot what do they have they have another process we call it as sufficient what is secretion since we absorptions are the things that we want we absorption are the things that we don't want okay feel if we don't want what do we don't want we don't want you yeah we do want ammonia we do one the whatever things that is harmful to the body right we call it a situation okay secretion okay now drugs and alcohol we do all right okay so drugs and alcohol is by simple diffusion simple diffusion and then urea ammonia the rest of it or even uric acid it will be active active transport okay so this is the distal convoluted tubule and then collecting dark is the part that they will form you win the last part so it's like formation of the wind that is the end of the kidney okay cancer this is the entire thing of kidney so we have to go through with one five factor three kidney also just in case you all don't know okay let's go back to the question where's my question again i have to click back okay let's go back to the question over here so this question is actually quite simple it's because they give you hinderable close mitochondria pct you just need to form into sentence over here so you can just write that more energy in the form of atp is produced by structure x glucose we absorb glucose reabsorption in blood capillaries occurs faster by active okay so this is the sentence that you can form because this question is a bit simple because they give you kim already okay now okay next question next one is phone five chapter five this one you also have to know how to do this question because i think it has five chances of coming out it haven't been coming out for many years if they don't come out in paper too uh they will also see in paper one like anyhow you still have to know this chapter okay if it's not paper too then people don't confirm you will see this tough question one lion two shows the process of ovum formation so since this oval formation we know that this is obviously it's mayonnaise right because ovum is a gamete gamete it will be meiosis right if it's obviously it's may or csi so in order to form over like another form program it must start from diploid number and then it will ends with haploid number right so over here the unsuited label phase m and phase q so from this diagram this is phase m and this is phase q right the m is a bit lower but it's supposed to be higher so when they are at the middle what is at the middle so if it's middle right obviously it's the metaphase just like you mentioned this is mayonnaise right beyonce is two by two metaphase one is two by two so you can see this two by two by two two by two by two so this is metaphase one okay this is metal phase one next q is one by one by one right after metaphase one you finish out of the process already right obviously they will follow by meiosis two so this is metaphase two method phase two so we have to answer metaphase one and metaphase two because we are at the equator and the middle which is the equator next one is explain the chromosomal behavior during phase m remember chromosomal behavior they must be something related to chromosome required as chromosomal behavior if it's prophase one sometimes they ask you to explain prophase one you cannot write spindle fiber starts to form because spindle fiber starts too long it's not something to do with the chromosome it's only just the the structure itself it's not a chromosomal behavior you must explain something to do with the chromosome because chromosomal behavior so obviously this one the arranged and the metaphase right they arrange a line in the metaphase because this is meiosis the term that we use is not chromosome the term that we use is homologous chromosome homologous chromosome so for those who can't differentiate mitosis meiosis one meiosis two i also had a video for to teach you how to differentiate these three processes please go and watch before i examine okay um tj is it bold is it possible for a question to come up in both paper and paper too paper one question is all chapter obviously it's possible basically it's all chapter one chapter means chapter two until five chapter six they will never miss a chapter for paper one never miss a chapter so you have to know every chapter for paper one okay can i say cannot use equator because she said it's a cell not ugh um in spm you can use equator equatorial plane metaphase plate so you have three labeling for that it creates a metaphase pick equatorial plane so you have three different different labeling so it's your choice to choose three answers also acceptable one if you look at the marking schema okay so this answer remember homologous chromosome so you can say homologous chromosome aligned randomly okay synth is metaphase okay since it's a metaphase one right you can see a line randomly as a headshot what is a tet chart head chart basically it means two by two or called bivalent two by two that's it i mentioned this one two by two by two right required as tab chart okay if you never write as a tab check it's also okay align randomly as attached at um equatorial plane or you can write metaphase plate or you can write equator okay tree also for right actually can see a video before stm whatever video in my youtube channel you can also watch like okay uh the video is already at youtube the how to differentiate my classes mayonnaise is one that one is already at youtube i don't know right now but you're going to find kbs m1 under the kbsm if i see homologous chromosomes for mitosis consider wrong yes it's wrong because mitosis we only use chromosome okay anyway too much light means two points the first one is this one second one what we're gonna write we're gonna write for a centromere of homologous chromosome which is a spindle fiber how come in this paint this this question here we correct spindle fiber because spindle fiber they attach to the centromere okay as you can see from this diagram let me zoom in for you to see here this middle part we call it as a centromere okay this one here pentromia the spindle fiber they will attach to the centromere of homo logos chromosome tetra is is same as bivalent right yes it's same as laryng okay so this one you can write spin the fiber attached on centromere of homologous chromosome homologous chromosome we use hormone luminous commercial forming it's correct mitosis we use chromosomal okay next question is in the box draw a label diagram to shows the cell after phase m after phase m is what after phase m is after metaphasic it will be anal phase one okay and phase one i think you can check ksm textbook for also colorful um uh that one is news today but uh okay the one really you guys don't have the chance to look at or to learn from the textbook itself already tomorrow's exam you don't have enough textbooks already you guys just throw your textbook away you don't need textbook right now you need to practice more professionally i may just draw another facebook right okay first of all this is animal style because it's album right so you just draw a round shape okay brown shade and then please remember to refer back to the diagram when you draw why what does it mean it means that in this diagram can you see over here got how many chromosomes one two three four five six right six chromosomes means you're gonna draw 16 six butterfly because it's being pulled apart and the size is also different right this one and this one is bigger the middle one is smaller right so you have to follow the size please remember follow the size follow the number follow the color size number color is something that you have to take note when you draw the textbook okay so draw first centrioles at the side left and right side both one and then because it's ana phase strike and our face should pull apart means pull apart so when you draw and just draw they are being pulled apart the top and the bottom one should be bigger the middle one should be smaller uh my drawing is very lousy but as soon as you get the idea of how to draw this thing in a can already a smaller one it's some bigger one okay then you draw the spindle fiber but from the san centro trios but anyway if you want to draw more spindle fiber right it's your choice like no you want to draw like more ching chong ling long it's not thinner but usually i don't draw more spindle fiber because i think it's a bit messy but it's your choice to choose whether you want or not and it's supposed to be full color shaded right because this one would be hard to see like supposed to be full color shaded by circular yes whenever you drop page paper to the diagram no matter what question refer back to the diagram next one explain why the size of cell y is different from cell x okay cell y and cell x as you can see from the diagram is x is bigger y is smaller right why x is bigger y is smaller because when you form over you can only form one secondary or sex the red sorbit required as a polar bodies and polar bodies it will be degenerated later on polar bodies and this one is the secondary secondary ulcer so when they fertilize it collides with over anaphase ii is only formative yes the sister chromatids same as mitosis same as mitosis meiosis two and mitosis is similar diagram no need to labor did they ask you to label oh need to label guys sorry need to label the diagram so whenever you draw php the questionnaire okay please label the diagram i forgot to read so you're gonna labor so first of all you're gonna labor this yes this as a spinder fiber spin the fiber this is the centrioles and this one we have the chromosome or you can label it as a homologous chromosome muscle can chromosome also can because they are being separated already right so since they are separated you can just write chromosomes okay can okay now back to the question why x and y is different in in size is because that they will have uneven cytokinesis your normally cytokinesis it means from one cell into two cells p meant after prophase metaphase anaphase telophase right after telophase we have a process called cytokinesis they have uneven cytokinesis over here uneven cytokinesis only you will have one bigger and three smaller the polar bodies it will be degenerated later on so we have to form sentence from this we're going to say which one is bigger which one is smaller and the reason why they are bigger and smaller so you can say cell y is smaller than cell x and equal separation of cytoplasm during cytokinesis during cytokinesis so this is the answer for it explain the importance of gamete formation in maintaining the number of chromosomes in the human life cycle feature can i draw like butterfly not the one picture i can't as long as you show them they are being separated that can already okay so formation of gametes to maintain number of chromosomes in the human life cycle gamete is always half plug in number and right if you want to form a whole human it must be ovum plus sperm only you have an over over human okay n plus n equals to 2n so right now gamete formation must be n when you form into human you will have two n okay they will have two and m plus n equals to two and right foot you have two n so that's why you have to maintain hepatic number in gametes in order for you to form diploid number of chromosomes in human cell if your gamete is two and right two n plus two one equals to four and five is not even a human or guys oh yeah i think it's horse like i think it's horse or whatever it's not human so it must be 46 in order to have a normal human normal i'm not saying that what downstream germa trisomy is different case but as a normal human should be 46 in number so you can see gametes contains peptoid number of chromosome so this haploid number obviously is 23 chromosomes for those who don't know this is 23 chromosomes during fertilization diploid zygote is formed which has the same number of chromosomes as parent so it was 23 it becomes 46 823 becomes 46 okay so this is the answer 23 46 because this is human they will not ask you anything that is not related to human if it's animals okay if it's animal and they ask you to write the number of chromosome right they will always give you the hepatic number or the dipole number if it's animal because you only learn human as politics so you never learn any other organism right so if it's any other organism besides human they will always give you the number of chromosomes either in half point number or dipole number the one in hypothetic number it must only be obama and sperm the rest of the number it will be diapered in number okay this is something that you have to remember next question she okay we spent one number to do two questions okay question she 3.1 shows a part of human a woman reproductive system named process wise so as you can see process white is releasing of secondary ul sex releasing of secondary ulcers required as ovulation guys we don't talk releasing of over required as releasing of secondary sex because only when you stop fertilizing is currently quite fertilized as obama okay if it's not then require a secondary sex meaning the hormone they stimulate the process in a1 hi yang jae okay so you want to name the hormone shine what is the hormones for ovulation obviously it's luteinizing hormone so for luteinizing hormone you cannot write lphr you must spell the word out neutronizing from what lieutenanizing a hormone now you can break it as lh so as the bottom question you can write just spread out but i don't i don't um encourage your product just like short form for hormones you can write atp adp dna but you cannot write short form for hormones name structure x so structure x is a flower like structure this flower like structure right required as corpus luteum corpus luteum so what is the importance of purpose built in purpose nutrient it contains high level of progesterone so progesterone is to maintain the thickness of endometrium usually these copper's duty it will maintain okay it will maintain when the person is pregnant because copper's due to right during pregnancy time it will maintain for three months which is the first trimester the first three months they need copper's duty to produce enough of progesterone and estrogen when the progesterone and estrogen is not high enough you will have miscarriage so that's why proper steel chem it is a very important function so after three months this copper's built-in will start to shrink but it's okay because after three months the placenta will take place so the placenta will basically will have the role of corpus luteum where they will secrete progesterone and estrogen to maintain the thickness of endometria so you see a structure x degenerate after eight weeks of pregnancy and the woman experienced a miscarriage so as i mentioned like purple system is the one that generate is the one that produces a progesterone and estrogen right eight weeks it's only two months it's not even the first trimester it's only like half of the trimester so that's why they have miscarriage okay okay um the answer you're gonna see it level of progesterone decreases the wall of endometrium break down the wall of endometrial breakdown is it okay if i write only lh instead of writing in full form i don't encourage you to just write alkha because in the most of the exam you have to write newtonizing hormone actually and no mitchell will break down no progesterone to maintain the thinking of animation correct that's why you have miscarriage don't have to write the woman experience miscarriage because it's in the question already the woman decided to undergo ivf in vitro fertilization bitcoin as tested baby after she failed to conceive she is given follicle stimulating hormone in her early treatment explaining why because fsph is the first hormone that in order for them to have the entire process for those who don't remember the hormones in sequence please remember the first hormone for menstrual cycle is fsh second is estrogen the third is luteinizing hormone the fourth is progesterone so without the fsh the entire process cannot takes place what is the function of fsh what does fsh stands for fsh stands for follicle stimulating hormone stimulating means one any hormone that has stimulating they will stimulate the word in front so they will stimulate the growth of follicles so the follicle becomes bigger it says also you have secondary ooze secondary follicles that really secondary or sex only you have luteinizing hormone to release secondary ulcers may i know adh those also need to wreck him forward yes and me hormones also need to wreck in also need to wreck in the longer the full form i know mutual more becomes thinner can uh candle actually can you know also okay but just like today remember i forgot to mention the osmotic pressure please someone remind me later again osmotic pressure okay let me finish this one first okay so you can see that is to stimulate the development of follicles to ensure follicle to mature into you can write secondary follicles or you can write the largest follicle required as graphene follicles graphene follicle is the one that released secondary usage graphene follicle that can't release secondary oh sex actually if you want to inject a lot of fs hr um it's not good for human body la i mean in the future if you want to know it's not good for a human body because sometimes it produces too much of when you're stimming too much of um oh secondary uh section they kind of like harm your ovary and if it's worst case you have to remove the entire ovary so what do you mean by osmotic pressure okay i spend like one one minute to explain why it's cosmetic because i forgot to explain what is osmotic pressure okay guys for those who don't know what is blood osmotic pressure okay osmotic pressure blood osmotic pressure means what it means that is the amount of solute in your blood for example high blood osmotic pressure means more solute lower blood osmotic pressure means lesser solute more solid means what more solute it means that for example when you are thirsty when you carry out vigorous exercise when a person has kidney failure the person has lesser water more other substances right required as high blood osmotic pressure when the person is like me right now okay um there's no dehydration there's no sweating means we have a normal blood osmotic pressure we have lower solid in our body because when you have a higher solute in your bloodstream right you'll get you're gonna get dehydration if it's worse the worst case you have to go for kidney uh you have to go for the hammer that uh dialysis already which is worse scenario kidney failure future can i write uterus lining instead of endometrium t-shirt yes you can utilize stunning and endometrium tissue and the mixture is the same thing okay ken okay next question this is form five chapter three yeah this is a very this is a very messy question king white oh i remember you king y okay teacher g n r hormone can write in short form a g and i h comma you can write in choco this is a this is the special one but usually in examine you don't i don't think you have chance to write g and h by the way because it's very very rare to ask g and rh but if you want to write of course you can write about measure cycle okay two point two shows a ceiling which is placed in horizontal position during germination mean hormone involved in this response so we have to explain this thing it's also important some topic that you have to know it's because that this one also haven't come out for a very long time already please take note like this part what is a fumio what is a radical for those who don't know it means the shoot radical it means the root okay radical roots few meal it means should anything related to this diagram okay this diagram remember oxin guys oxy i should have wrecked it over here oxin okay oxy oxin has two things okay two characteristics in this diagram number one at shoot they will promote elongation at the root it will inhibit elongation it means if it's shoot over here because oxygen is produced at the tip of shoot and tip or foot right which is over here tip of shoot tip of root due to gravitational force of gravity they will be deposited or accumulated at the base of the horizontal base of the shoot and root so since should promote elongation right this one it becomes longer path radical inhibits elongation this part it becomes shorter that's why this one it will bend upwards this one it will grows downwards shoot and root shoot the one the reason why their bands output is because they need to get sunlight right in order for them to carry out photosynthesis the root that bend down was because they want to absorb more water and mineral in this diagram here can you see any sun no sun right no sun means you cannot write what you cannot write about phototropism no sun you can only write about geotropism because there's no sun how do you assume this is a phototropism unless the question gives you a sun then only you can write phototropism you can write the shoot is positive phototropism the root is negative geo or negative a phototropism since there is nothing here no sun here we can only base on the duotropism so for uh since we cannot write photoshop isn't right so this is a negative geotropism this is a positive jaw tropism it means it goes towards the ground goes towards the gravity in the space provided draw and label the observation which which will be seen on the ceiling after three days so as i mentioned just now the shoot it will bend upward the route it will bend downwards okay again i have to show my very ugly drawing so first you just draw the upper part okay you got that a bit ugly and then nissan had to go upwards again he said go downwards oh no i supposed to draw better version cannot draw better version okay like that okay i started to show one upwards one download scanner already please remember to label just actually just label everything that you draw is the safest if not just now see just have forward to labor missing walmart already so this is should or you can say pumu i direct you also correct one actually and this is radical radical it means this is a root okay explain how the restaurant shows by pumu occurs in this question right what they ask they only want you to write the should means you don't have to explain anything about the root only write about should don't have to write anything about the root okay so since shoots uh oxtin it will be deposited at the base of the shoot right it will it will promote elongation since they promote elongation it means that the bottom part it will have a faster growth rate so since the bottom part has the faster growth rate it was they were they were curved upwards okay just explain this kind of really two months only unless it's a ac question you're going to write everything down i don't know whether i did in mri summer sap or i forgot already guys i just remember i did it in my previous class oxin accumulated at the horizontal base of shoot due to gravity or you can say due to gravitational force or gravity also can gravitational also can gravitational pull so can stimulate elongation at lower part of shoot that causes it to elongate faster than upper part the shoot bends upward which shows a negative jaw chopism which shows a negative george orbiter okay i think i speak very fast today not bad which is my normal speed because i think myself svp is a bit slow that's why you can times 1.5 am i too fast guys it's okay like if i'm too fast you just drag the thing back okay check it back thank you already okay next one question four four point one shows the relationship between the blood circulatory system and the lymphatic system in humanness is five chapter one under lymphatic system whenever you look at lymphatic system please remember three parts with three labeling okay three parts with three labeling first of all you're gonna find the first part okay the first part it must be the blood capillary so in this question okay you're gonna find vocabulary first we have artery we have vein right it means this part here is the blood capillary but there are one part we ask you to label it is the blood capillary which is the vessel x if you know this vessel x is under artery right what is the vocabulary so this is the blood capillary let me label here blood capillary okay second one okay what is the what is the or your buy your power already so your speed is good enough you you should have the same level also actually let's get teacher can go faster teacher wrap faster in class in my normal cases faster right okay okay i will try to remain this fit because sometimes when i when i speak too faster then i cannot pronounce the word properly already okay so the second part is what the second part is the interstitial space where is the interstitial space you have to find in between an open space okay this open space site is over here now this one is interstitial space interstitial space also known as the intercellular space both also correct interstitial space or inter-cellular space whichever that you prefer both also correct so this is the second location the third location is the lim capillary so lean capillary obviously is obvious vessel right because you only left one choice over here so this is the limb kathy levy so if you don't know how to differentiate whether it is a blood capillary or limb capillary very simple they will give you some hint here one can you see this artery here right so this is artery the one that goes in over here this part here it must be blood capillary and for limb capillary if you notice this one here is limb right i mean it goes here right and then it's lean right so that's why vessel y is the limb besides knowing the name what do you have to know you have to know about the content in blood in in all of the parts here blood capillary content they have blood blood plasma second one interstitial space what do they have they have interstitial fluid which is fluid exact tissue space can interstitial fluid and then the last one is lima so this is the labor part that you have to know the fluid inside the labor part okay firstly we have all of these things already out we can go to the questionary name the following vessel x and master y we have the answer capillary and lim capillary uh intercellular space and tissue space also can but i prefer you to write interstitial space or intercellular space these two interstellar space because for tissue right required as tissue blue wheat blood but that one is kssm silica actually but if you follow the kbs m1 it will be interstitial space or inter cellular space also can okay explain how fluid zag is formed what is plus again fluid insect is the interstitial fluid right so if it's interstitial how do they form okay because as i mentioned there are three different part right number one two and three it means what this interstitial fluid comes from the blood capillary okay actually it's like that let me draw a very simple version this is the body cell this is the blood capillary this is the interstitial space directing shock formula this is the body cell okay because blood capillary has two endings i don't think i explained this unless it's in my video like my normal video i've seen this before so a oh by the way on this one we have two ending so the first ending the first part required arterio and the the other type required as venus and or daniel and also cannot avenue and sound spatula venue and smaller version of rtb venue it means like smaller version of b okay so an absolute end due to different size of the ending okay it has it will cause a high hydrostatic pressure okay just when we learn about hydrostatic pressure at the kidney right it's also because of different size of dome right bigger lumen to solid lumen right it's also the same because different size of lumen that's why they have high hydrostatic pressure high hydrostatic pressure since they have high hydrostatic pressure just now we learned about kidney it will force the fluid out from the kidney right what do they force out besides what they were besides red blood cell and plasma protein why because they are too large same as this part okay most of the fluid it will diffuse into it besides except the red blood cell accept a blood plasma protein plasma protein and platelet why because they are too large to diffuse across seams as the reason just now we learned about kidney because all of the fluid diffuse into the interstitial space it will cause odama means like your body tissue will be swollen i don't want that to happen so what happens is it will return back to the bloodsheet so let me use other color okay here okay it will return back to the ban your end okay how many percent return back it will be 85 to 90 percent return back if they ask you why they return back you have to say that because at daniel and it has a low hydrostatic pressure absorber n has a high hydrostatic pressure right vanillin has a low hydrostatic pressure so it will be turned back what about the 10 to 15 percent the 10 to 15 it will goes to the limb it will goes into the limb capillary as lima okay limb capillary as limb okay so this is this is how the entire things work so we're gonna form sentence right now so for this one you're gonna say that fluid zach is interstitial fluid okay we're gonna we're gonna start sentence from here first you're gonna say that high hydro static pressure occurs at observable and of blood can't be there is due to different size of lumen elephant chassis as same as automatic different elephant tells this is uh is caused by parasites orima is just that accumulation of fluid in the body in in the space so the body tissue will be swollen so elephant that is must have the paris factor a different size of lumen okay next one these pressure forces most of the fluid to diffuse into inter special space most of the fluid okay if you want to be more complete you can see the these pressure forces most of the fluid from blood plasma to refuse into interstitial space so this is the answer okay now then with this one we're gonna move towards to see okay you're okay here right you're okay up to here right can write okay you have any question you can just write it down i will i will explain whenever i see your question or whenever i finish a question okay next one 85 of interstitial fluid that leaves the blood must be returned into blood circulatory system explain what will happen if the excess interstitial fluid fails to be returned to vessel x so when you have extra interstitial fluid that cannot be turned back required as for them in this question if right elephant tlcs your answer is strong if you write any fantasies you must strike or demand not elephant chances or demons so this one you can just write a all demon occurs where excess fluid accumulated at interstitial space these causes bodhi ki shu to what is spleen spin is the one that breaks down the blood so it's the one that stores the red blood cells please it's on your one proper body so if you want to okay sorry this is not good okay so if someone murders someone uh they will pierce through the spleen because it's the one that stores red blood cell okay kent next one deep 4.2 shows one of the body defense mechanism that occurs in the lame notice is also on the phone five chapter one uh when it comes to the body defense mechanism we have first second and third line defense mechanism whenever you see the word antibodies okay this one whenever you see the word antibodies you want to remember this one obviously is the third line defense mechanism because first line is very superficial one like noroskina your saliva your stomach ah those are first very nuke one okay the second one is like better version which is phagocytosis which we have phagocytes the monocyte and the neutrophil they will carry up eating process third line is the strongest line okay this strongest line if it's not working right you're gonna get sick so third deadline defense mechanism is the strongest because they use what they use them for sex lymphocytes is the one that produces limb antibodies is the one that produces antibodies because it occurs at the lymph node right so you must remember a lymph node contains of lymphocytes lymphocytes is the one that contains produces antibodies they ask you to explain the mechanism used by antibodies to destroy antigen there are four different mechanisms when you look at this diagram because third line got treat are four different mechanisms the first mechanism is lysis lysis it means breakdown only no collisions second one is known as observation opsonization is coming suiciding like you commit suicide okay oh my god i just saw this name i'm sorry right surprise my student my ex student also third one okay we have mutualization okay neutralization means you neutralize it okay the first one we have agglutination agglutination so actually for this diagram it is the agglutination the antigen was sticks on the antibodies will stick on the antigen eventually it will be eaten by the phagocytes oxonization neutralization and agrutination they will carry out phagocytosis by the phagocytes okay so this is the one okay okay you all know what this antigen and antibodies are already right antigen is the marker for the bacteria requires antigen antibody is the one that is the one that helps us to kill microorganisms okay so your answer is agglutination and glutination so you can explain your answer by saying that antibodies form together and causes them to be unable to function unable to function next next one you can also explain by saying that phagocyte will then engulf the plum pink peptogen by phagocytosis okay can this diagram is bad while you blame the diagram any importance experiment in paper she actually like your try the state paper all of the state paper usually like there will be one question from a state paper one i don't know which one but it depends on your law and the question that usually haven't come up before you have to focus on these two points your chinese paper for all of the state paper this year and the questions that haven't come out before these are the two things that i can let you know i mean if you want to focus on paper sheet if you don't know how to study for paper sheet c health organization doctors and scientists agree that vaccines are safe and effective despite this they are there is a growing movement of parents choosing not to vaccinate their children and feedback parent nissan malaysia don't really have antibiotic parents usually that because it's a must to be vaccinated anti-vaccination are almost certainly contributing to these trends what are the effects of refusing vaccine to their child and community okay we don't talk about comic 19 guys no community here we talk about the normal vaccination like hepatitis a chickenpox are like misosa um polymath polio malatiza there's a lot of different viral infection that it will spread if you don't get the vaccination for the chiron so if the children get all of the viral infection right the baby gonna get sick so it's not very smart idea that if you don't want your kid to be vaccinated like why why i mean b6 covet 19 because carbon 19 they have have not enough of research for kids to have vaccination like below 16 because if you think about it right if you're if you have a kid like below 16 years old would you let the kid to be the experience the experiment for this medication no right so for guys every one of you please go and get vaccinated huh i mean like if you are the empty right mindset uh please go and get vaccination for kobe 19. save the world guys save your siblings younger siblings anyway write your answer not very smart parents refusing ah vaccination yeah uh backstreet nation finally cannot spell it with vaccine nation causes ciao to encounter peace with this week they are health and life ciao can be easily exposed to bacterial bacteria and virus or viral infection also can it is also it also it also spreads disease and risk of health of other people in community so please this is how we state the world by getting vaccination guys less immunity depending on what kind of a disease that we are talking about some of the immune some of the disease right if you get it you you die you die you don't even have the chance to produce antibodies you die okay but if it's chicken pox then it's different because chicken pox you can be covered right but if you get more polio malaria you're gonna die guys so yeah that's why no one in malaysia get polio anymore because we got vaccinations next one next question finally question five okay so question five is form four chapter eight question i actually mentioned for quite a few times before no matter whether in the previous video or in during my usual class i say that chapter 8 is not a very common ask question in section a but reason year which is last year and the year before they actually came out in section 8 means you cannot choose this question you want to study or you don't want to study because previously right you can actually skip chapter eight and chapter nine that's the easy question because it's four choose two ac right you can actually skip chapter eight and chapter nine if you do want to do the ac question but right now it appeared in section a since they appear in section eight right means you have to study already previously they can really don't like they can just don't study chapter in the night but you guys cannot lie because chapter eight is the question that you will see in your exam right chapter nine you will not see in section a chapter nine is only section b like it will be confirmed an aca question for for section b okay uh usually for section b question nine question uh like k but question like you have to think one is open question so you have to think we will try that equation later 5.1 shows the distribution of mangrove plants at the river mouth name one dominant plant at p and q so we're gonna name the species whenever we explain about mangrove swamp you must know four species here for those who don't know the species let me teach you a way to remember remember a sexy red bull okay a sexy red bull okay a is one a we call it as every senior species and be called as a sonar racial species r is rhizophora species b is bulgaria species y'all watch too much of uncle roger already i thought it's t-shirt lightning you studied too much of doctor already yeah you go back to your doctor's course okay this one is biology now they are spm only you already mbbs are you okay so for these four different species you must know in sequence why because you have to know for labeling since it's a s r b right okay a s r b right first of all you have to find the river the one that is nearest to the river or the mud bank because they actually label the money bank right so moneybaby is not a species of money being just a mud right okay after the muddy bag it will be the first species the one that is nearest to the muddy bank or nearest to the sea this is the sea right nearest to the sea so p is the first pc so we have a every senior species after peace what kill right after p is key right the one that nearest the river right here is a sauna racial species and then we have our rhizophora species and bubera species remember in this sequence you must know in this sequence asrbl sexy weight gua every single centimeter riser flora bugara and what do you have to know here you have to know which one is a pioneer species which one is the successor species okay so for pioneer species what does pioneer mean pioneer it means the first ever species we call as pioneer species second one second one is the suspect processor it is the one that takes over the pioneer species every senior and sonar racial species required as a pioneer species if you want to choose which one is first obviously it's ibiza it is the answer to drug only one rhizophora and bulgaria species is the successor successor species is the one that takes over okay it's the one that takes over how do we know is aggregation from the diagram you have to study the diagram you have to look at the diagram means you have to go through the diagram before later you flip your flip tree on notes you can see there's a difference between that i mean you have to recognize diagram this one um okay back to the question since we have flavor what is p and q already right uh p is every single q is for no racial species mangrove logging activity are carried out uncontrollably in zone p which is every single species explain the effects of mangrove logging activity at zone p on the manual succession process so basically uh this question it says they cut the every single species when you cut the every single species it means that the roots cannot anchor on the soil there will be aquatic animals underneath it at the there's no more animals no more animals it means that the the economy of state the economy status basically you will die and they ask you about the successions process right when there is no pioneer species obviously you cannot take over how do you want to take over when there is nothing for you to take over right it's like you're going for competition right you're the only one person who compete means you are the only winner right sourcing is the same thing you cannot success you cannot take over when there's not no one in front of you how to be number two when there's only one contestant right same goes to this as well so for every single thesis what is that okay we're gonna go through the the characteristic vessel every single species and sonar racial species they have long extensive cable route long extensive cable because they have to hold on the soy because they're soft and muddy sorry you can see there's muddy area rhizophora species they have prop roots okay prop roots bugara species they have buttress root guys it's buttress not buttless okay business no but okay it's a butcher's true okay anyway besides this one uh the other thing that you have to know about eddie senior and sauna rachel's business is they have a thing called yuma falls okay you marked her first yuma truffles it is a breeding root yuma of course it is a breeding root so for breeding root is the one that carry out gases exchange during low tide okay v6 this one what do you have to know about the mangrove song before we continue with the question because i want to explain everything first okay besides this moment they have to know you have no other characteristic of mangrove storm as well number one you're gonna know about they have thick and thick cuticle and succulent leaves what a succulent means succulent it means that they are they can store water be quite succulent so thick cuticle is to reduce rate of transpiration okay weight of that means the rate of water loss succulent leaf is to store water how to calculate frequency percentage there's a formula there you have to retrieve the formula can just want to know confirm tomorrow is a character form a point form must be in the sentence form sentence form okay you cannot write point only must be sentence from teacher verb is the high data hydrator later since you mentioned about hydratos okay next one we have high dark toads okay haida dots is because they want to overcome to overcome the high salinity of sea water so since adrian asked what is the haida torch right this is the leaves okay i cannot draw a very nice beef but these are leaves at the ending of the leaf there are high dark thoughts over here it's the same place where guttation takes place the dot dot okay so you can actually see there is water but you know almost regulation right also from five chapter one guttation okay guardation happen is between the leaf so in the morning you can see that it's morning dew so the droplet water droplet they are from the hyderabad as well mango salt they are salt on top so if you go to picnic and i'm not enough salt you go to the mango plants and you collect some salt i'm just joking guys please don't do that okay so this is to overcome the high salinity salinity means salt salt concentration okay another one because i'm just writing a very short shot like revising for you to remember what is the characteristics i didn't write the entire thing though hi that's those next one we have vb parity what is vb parity because this one have to overcome the seed from dying overcome the seed from dying so because there is mangosteen is muddy plant right so if the seed falls on the muddy soil that you'll be washed away by the sea water so there is no more no more germination right so they will actually they are they will actually grow on the parent plants before they drop onto the mud so they will drop before they before they they grow bigger that's human so humor is baby parity as well baby parity so because we stay in our mom's room for nine months it's the same thing baby parity and parasitism almost the same concept like almost like i would say almost concept because for the priority plan they will obtain the nutrients from the parents also like you when you're in the mother's womb but you don't call yourself as a parasite right if you said though you caught yourself a parasite you caught as few guitation and transpiration is different transformation happens during the day time afternoon time cartesian it happens during the cold time and also the night time so it's two different process open sleep process only okay no need higher those for the answer right a lonely nominee this characteristic is for what i'll discuss if you ask me this question this character you say it's called mangrove swamp all of the characteristic is for mangrove sun okay so uh the human toughness is the breeding world at the mention just already this is the mangrove song character we say how how do you want to have the adaptation for mangrove song okay mangroves also must study a little bit anders colonization and substation of pawn must study a little bit of solar okay in sentences for this one you can say the number of every senior species decreases lesser root to trap to trap mud the swamp of mangrove swamp mangrove swamp become less dense and no successor species able to continue with succession process because you don't have no yet nothing from the you have no pioneer species how do you get successes with this right just like mentioned the how does this entire things work right who is john happy birthday whoever you are okay a study on mangrove swamp in malaysia revealed that they were 25 times number of some fish species in mangrove areas compared to the areas where mangrove some have been cutting down it shows that the mangrove storm is a productive ecosystem that could provide numerous benefits to our economy based on the statement give two reasons why the ecosystem in 5.1 needs to be preserved and conserved from our economy economy will be venue okay so over here it says what it says this is the fishes it means what you can use the fish to sell is it increasing your economic status of malay or the country obviously yes right but if you remove the mangrove swamp basically you cannot earn money because the fish cannot be there so that's why you have to preserve and conserve you have to make sure that there are mangroves strong you have to make sure that there are mangroves some so that the economical status for proficient mana whoever or even for the mangrove trees are in order to be dead so that malaysia not because it's malaysia people like malaysia will be slightly better law right not so poor right if i write the species incorrect of course your answer is wrong pieces naming term in biology is important but let's say you stop then then okay you start wrongly or you spell therefore wrongly you spell those isa ara doesn't matter one but the key word you must spell correctly maintain food that also can maintain food right food chain also can so you can write any tool you can write as that as source of food or you can see a breeding ground breeding wrong and nesting place for animal aquatic animal also can't so your choice okay or you can say a main source income for fishermen or you can say as a theorism area also can usually for mangrove sun there's a lot of answer writing to your reason so you can see it as equal terrorism or recreation area also can okay next question 5.2 shows the modern farmer was observing the damage at his peripheral he noticed that the decrease of crop yield is caused by the mice in the area so you have mines over here okay the farmer carried an activity to estimate the size of mice population in his petty field the result is shown in table one so in order for you to count the population of mice you have a formula i have before before that okay you have to answer the technique that used by the farmer in order to tell population there's a technique here called capture mug release recapture capture mark release recapture capture mark really should capture if you miss one word wrong okay it's called capture mark release recapture technique what is a capture mark release recapture technique capture means you catch after you catch you mark after you mark you release back to the their habitat after that you'll be capture them again so this release and recapture duration right it will be two to three weeks one cannot be too long because if it's too long it means that the organism they will uh move away from the area they will die because of this predator they will give pub so that your number is not accurate anymore so two to three weeks is enough but why is it not lesser than two to three weeks because if it's lesser than two to three weeks it means that they cannot mix with the population yet so two to three weeks is the best idea so it's the ideal ideal time for them to hang around teacher is then possible that reproduction and growth will come out for ac i would say there are chances that especially for human growth and insects growth they are chances as well because for human growth and insects growth is a question that they have not come out for many years as well okay so you can also focus but there are a lot of questions that you have to no longer not only just this one you have to know about four chapter three from chapter six from chapter four also okay based on table one estimate the size of population okay what is the formula to calculate capture map relationship capture the formula very simple first time second over mark recapture okay first time second over mark we capture so means what your answer is 70 first right times second is 85 over 40 okay you all do your calculation by yourself so your answer will be a a one four nine i guess one four nine right if there is decimal place place a round off your decimal place less than four uh do the normal mathematic round off okay so this is one fortnight because there is no one four four four nine point one mice who is the point one minus only the third or only the lake 1.4.149.5 what is left left ahead is it so you cannot have any decimal place when you come for population feature for this video we posted after class yes it will be repeated anyway okay the farmer wanted to reduce the size of the red population by using environmental friendly techniques suggest and explain the benefits of the technique so suggestion is one mark by naming it is one mark explaining that benefit is another mug so what is the suggestion if you don't want to use any it's an eco-friendly technique eco-friendly technique means what this is the biological control there's no pesticides or biological control so your answer is control or pre-predator also can biological control so because if you use biological control right you will not harm any hydro organism basically let's say if you use pesticides or whatever whatever poison that you use right maybe it's not just the the mice who eat the poison so let's see the mice is the poison the other one who eats the mice the other organism will also get the poison so whoever we the organism will get a poison so basically it has a link for that so for humor who eats whatever things we also get poison i'm not saying that we eat mao style okay i'm not saying that we might i'm saying that other organisms as well like chicken or duck or whatever okay biological is the best one but it's less effective like if you control if you compare with the pesticides it's slow so biological control the disadvantage is they are slow okay so this one you can see it kill red without using poisons that will not cause pollution or water pollution or any type of pollution or it will not cause any other organism from dying and compare wise they are actually cheaper cheaper but less effective in a way to say that cheaper but less defective okay ken next question finally we are in ac questions so ac question this is form five chapter two actually for four five chapter two right if you ask me whether it will come out or not if they come out for a human question right usually like they are quite k but it means they are like disease question they don't ask what labeling question that's too easy guys you ask if this person got this position got what disease if this person got that thing got what effect or something like that they will not ask you or what is this one what is this formula is this bonus that's too simple so they will use another way for you to explain your answer so for question six it says 6.1 shows the bone tissue of 30 years old woman 6.2 shows the bone tissue of 30 years old individuals suffering from osteoporosis osteoporosis suggests ways to maintain the bone condition as shown in 6.1 okay you want to make sure that these humans here don't have any osteoporosis because you want to maintain or basically you want to prevent osteoporosis so you have two ways to prevent number one is by eating habit number two is by exercising your lifestyle your lifestyle and your eating habits so you can based on these two points to explain your answer four months right two for eating habit two for lifestyle okay so number one this is based on lifestyle so if it's lifestyle wise you can ask them to do more exercises but the exercises carry out by osteoporosis is not lifting weight uh lifting weight confirmed the bone will break so you're gonna ask them to do the weight bearing exercise what does the weight bearing exercise mean with bearing exercise it means that you use your own body weight or you use a very low weight thing to carry exercises like for example you stand with one leg those are known as weight bearing exercise standing with one leg uh or using one hand to support those alcohol weight bearing exercises you don't lift the weight okay so you can see carry out regular exercises okay so we call it as weight bearing exercise okay weight bearing exercise okay another one besides that why do we have to carry out with varying exercise is because that you want to increase bone mass you have to make sure that your body is familiar with your own body weight like if your body is not familiar right it means what means when you jump you fall your bone break if your bone is not familiar with your own body right now so that's why you have to carry out weight varying exercises so that your body will remember how heavy you are or how light you are okay iso measure is too hard for them okay next one we have eating habit eating heavy just now someone mentioned about increasing vitamin d calcium and phosphorous okay so vitamin d calcium and phosphorus can make it into two points because vitamin d increases absorption of calcium and phosphorus that is also correct okay so for eating habit number one you can see thick food that is rich in calcium so calcium they will form stronger bone you can say take or consume more vitamin d so you can absorb more uh calcium and phosphorus more calcium and phosphorus so basically you already have your four marks over here based on the point that you write like uh in exam please make sure that your your sentence is full sentences uh the one that i'm writing right now this one is a full sentence this one is a full scientific sentence so you can say take food that is high in calcium so that stronger bone can be found or something like that okay so you have to make sure that you you write in full sentences so don't write something like that okay cancer this is the answer next one fish fish question actually came out two years ago as a structure question chop max question okay as a as a chalkbox question so basically this question i don't know whether it will come out but let's practice a lot just in case never know maybe paper one you need to use this answer you need to use this knowledge also right six point two shows the lateral wheel of a fish six point three six by four shows the cross section of a fish at x showing the myotomes what is the myotomous myotone means muscle we call it as based on 6.3 and 6.4 explain the adaptation for fish to move in water six marks you can write three explanations vitamin d you cannot say okay you cannot go to go to go under the hot sun i mean i mean if you want keller but vitamin d consumer would better unless you choose the correct timing if you want to obtain vitamin d every day eight o'clock if it's 12 cop also got by telling me right but you'll also get skin cancer okay so for fish question actually came up like two years ago i think yeah your year was so sad okay so this one explanation okay again for those who don't understand what is explanation what is adaptation explanation means you have to write statement and explain okay statement and explain required explanation what is adaptation adaptation means characteristic okay it means characteristics so we're gonna write tree adaptation means explain uh statement experience statement and explain statement explain okay can i vitamin d not come from sun yes it's come from sun but who gonna go under the sun every single day you obtain vitamin d will be the faster one okay okay you you eat you can buy the sub payment supplement whatever my timing you want also got multivitamin okay what is the characteristic of fish number one you can write um they have streamlined body means streamlined like what you okay maybe you all don't remember your physics already okay so you can see streamline body shape so streamlined body shape is to reduce water resistance okay number two you can write they have overlapping skill this overlapping scale it fades backwards overlapping scale that face backwards okay why must face backwards cannot face thunder because the fish and the water is this direction so the skill is following the direction of water because if it's the same if it's opposite direction and water right the skin will drop will fall off so it must be the same direction of the water so that the skin will not fall off so the overlapping skill is basically same thing it's a reduced frictional drag which is the water resistant so if you want to keep on writing water resistant of course you can change other way of writing it such as you can reduce frictional drag frictional drag okay next one we have one more right slimy coating slimy coating because if you touch fish before you know that there's a slime a slimy coating area so slimy coating also same thing is to reduce water resistance since all of the answers are similar right what else can you write you cannot talk about pin later but let me write down surface and you can say reduce a drag force or you can write maintain smooth flow of water over body okay since you see all of this thing is similar it's okay we have other answers to right as well we talked about finn this question is a very kind-hearted question why because they give you all of the labeling here uh you can repeat explanation up but if you don't want of course you can choose other way of explaining because for for fisher for fish for bread for um what's it called earthworm their explanation are similar means they only have one choice to explain but other things we have other explanation right but fish only got the same explanation you have no other explanation already so for pin the whites or casings i mentioned about pin right we have five pins in total they actually give you the final really pectoral pin pelvic pin dorsal fin ventral pin and caudal fin for if you guys don't know the location remember pectoral means the chest this is the chest of the p-shaped pectoral fin pelvic fin is the heat i mean cavity quite heat going right so it's like yeah i keep the heat is over there so the ratio of the fish is like too heat and then the lake okay not the table okay if you want to imagine this one next one we have dorsal fin dorsal means the top part in scientific term ventral means the bottom part cordon means the ending part cordon means the ending part of a fish it comes in three different parts first pectoral and pelvic fin it is known as a pair fin okay what is it called perfume because left side got one right side got one paraffin dorsal fin and ventral fin we call it as medium fin medium spin means what medium fit means they are in the middle tail fin is the caudal fin okay these three different character characteristics of fins they have different function panpin they will prevent pitching okay one is pitching pitching is the up down movement so the fish it will not move like that this is a very dumb very cute fish they don't move like that okay so they can move upwards they can move down but they cannot move like that when they stream okay this is not a very smart idea program teaching number two they can act as a stabilizer it can actually stabilize so that they will not have like weird movement they can also act as a brake light dorsal pin and ventral feet they will prevent let me cancel this one they will prevent rolling rolling and your wing rolling is roll like roll your wing is left right so if you understand managing just remember also the left right just for you by the yellow okay so yao wing is left right okay rolling is like turning still fin tailpin is the caudal fin caudal fin is to provide forward trust provide forward trust you all know what is for transplant former trust means is to allow the fish to swim forwards it's called forward trust so this is a characteristic of peace if you don't want to write the streamline body if you don't want to repeat the question you can write the fin characteristic as well okay so you must know about the earthworm and also you know about the grasshopper as well grasshopper so grasshopper and their own muscle and they have their characteristic and also bread also but three more you can beat chula more or less the same a fish and bird or quite similar as well so you can read through that next one human question uh this is a guy 30 yet 37 years old meal gardener he shows early symptom of msd which is musculoskeletal disease musculoskeletal means well muscular means muscle skeletal means bone okay musculus means bone so it's something to do with the bone and muscle and it says muscular skeletal disease consists of a minor physical disability that affects muscle bone and joint ms dvds increased with age symptoms of msd include muscular pain in which knee shoulder and back we have swollen joints preventive measurement can be taken to prevent msd changes in lifestyle habits and thick suitable diet can help your bones muscle and joint together based on the above statement and your biological knowledge suggests various ways that you can advise mr k to improve his health condition so right now you're going to imagine yourself as a doctor doctor official therapist or whatever you have to imagine yourself as a medical student right now okay see the person at msd what are the ways that you can advise him to overcome a problem because it's a minor minor minor effect of a daily life right so because he's a gardener right he has a vigorous activity right in a way to say that because it's a garden he always like bend down the body to cut to move the thing number one he has to wear suitable attire because if the pants is too tight means the blood flow is not good okay blood flow is not good number two he has to wear a better shoe means if the shoe is a bit with the high heels one not the highest you get the that the girls but you know some of the shoes are quite high you all get what i mean right now high the higher heel on so you have to wear a flat shoe so that they will not apply pressure on the knee take some msg mr k is weak you all watch too much of anger although they are wearing orange color also so uncle are just weak people big people also lactose intolerance are so weak for human okay so anyway these are the characteristics dimensional you have to wear a better shoe you have to make sure that the body structure posture is all right and you have to make sure that don't wear the clothes and you have to consume a balanced diet you have to eat more vitamin d calcium and phosphorus for them to have a better bone or fat better muscle formation as well so i just write like okay 10 months you can write a five statement five explanation if you don't have the five explanation then you're gonna write six points and four explanations as long as you have ten points okay as long as you have ten things to write so first you can see um otherwise mr k to have to to to have a good posture because bad posture leads to back pain or the scenario will be weak but will be worse worse as well so means like more back pain for him number two wear proper attire type quote pet clothing can be strict blood circulation like for boys who like to wear the pants uh you have to take care of your other little brother also like you know some people like to wear like super tight pens for boys sometimes the other part also needs to breathe out guys okay another one always wear a suitable shoes for activity like such as the flat shoes so the flat shoes basically because the high heel shoe it will apply pressure on it so you can see high heels make body to lean forward and and causes pressure on backbone and knee joint so for girls who always wear high heels you should feel the same pain as well oh mr k should do proper exercise can can i see mr k should not force himself to do intensive activity uh you can carry out regress activity actually just that you have to reduce the amount of previous activity teacher can i say change job i cannot like cannot change job but people this is the only job that he can do right right cannot write okay okay he cannot write chinese java so clearly you know he's looking on paper so they can say warm up before vigorous exercises this is to loosen up the muscle so that you can prevent muscle cramla prevent muscle cramp okay but mr k is a milk oh y'all don't know guys you know boys shoes leather shoes it has heel at the back all of the leather shoe that boys bear it has a heel at the back but just at the heel it's not that the thin heel okay it's like a thicker one that is also healed like higher heels for leather shoes if you guys notice that at the back your heels right comfortable but heels on next one consume a balanced diet or you can ask him to consume more vitamin d phosphorus and calcium this is to prevent osteoporosis okay so this is the answer hire other people to do it she already a worker how does a worker hire a worker hello even who i got money to hire he he worked as one then he asked people to hire him a higher other one it's like me okay it's like i teach by you i ask someone else to teach by you on behalf of me what is this cannot be right okay next one question seven seven point one shows the effect of imbalance of hormone executed by the pitot telegram which is the master gland why keto turning gland known as a master gland is because that pitot telegram control all other endocrine glands by secreting hormone required as the master gland so in this question it says pituitary gland secrete x hormone we have individual a individual b and normal percent based on 7.1 explain the effects of imbalance of hormone x to individual a and individual b okay so for for this question here you can see what different height right one two three right different height right you're telling me order outsourcing fire quinn other people are no longer guys okay biology and soda okay obviously different height means what this kit is come on but we don't like gh right you know it is a correct name for gh so a tip for you for those who don't know a tip for you to know all of the most of the hormones from the p2 telegram it has short form okay yeah shot from like fsh lh gh adh or whatever okay the one with shot format they come from peter graham so for individual a can you see it's like so tall like taller than a normal person so this person has a giant teaser or acromegaly depending on whether it's a childhood or whether it's adulthood the other one the short short individually the cute cute guy here it is daubism is a person like a group hormone so basically a has a lot of group hormone b has lesser group hormone individual a toxic the people who are born like that okay so you can say individual a has jai chan teasing or you can say acro medley a gigantism and aquaman valley one is childhood one is the adult food gigantism is childhood this one is adulthood okay and then has given this a mark for acromegaly he grows abnormally tall due to over sufficient of growth hormone okay next one of course if you want to explain more you can see they have abnormal increase of body of bone density of bone tissues okay abnormal increase in length of bones lao shi hao okay anyway we're gonna talk about b or by the way jahan is one of our chemistry teacher so that's why i say bye to him because no more chemistry is has dwarvism so you can explain that this is due to under secretion of growth hormone this retards the bone growth okay um [Music] how to draw paper tree graph you have to see on your measurement your number sometimes it's not shape it can be curved usually they are killed it can be also depending on the numbers itself easy biology people who don't take biology say easy biology wow well okay now the next one we're gonna look at the next question malaysia is experiencing global warming or the equinox phenomenon which must mean that the sun is at the above the equator means by hotline okay twice each year in march and september as a result of high temperature we can expose to heat stroke which the body temperature level can increase above 40.5 degrees celsius normal individual body temperature is 37 degrees celsius so obviously that this is why you call heat stroke heat shock will cause someone to faint or if it's very worse it will cause someone to die diagram 7.2 shows the effect of the heat stroke of an individual the internal environment of the body needs to be regulated to maintain body temperature at the normal range explain how physical action and metabolic processes regulate the body temperature on the hot day in this question we have two parts number one is based on what the physical action number two is based on metabolic processes but if you don't know which one is vitron it's okay you write everything that you know from when a person has uh when a person experiences hot day okay just write everything you know based on hot day okay so when a person standing under the hot day hey what will happen to the person just like everything you know you don't have to separate whether it's a physical action or metabolic process doesn't really matter just write everything down so when a person is at a hot day okay negative mechanism correct okay so if there's a hot day do you think the person will sweat more or sweat lesser sweat more of sweat lesser guys hot day obviously they were okay sorry i forgot this one is delayed 30 30 seconds to one minute of course they will sweat more okay so when they sweat more it means that they can uh release heat they can cool down their body temperature besides extracting you can talk about the erector muscle the erector muscle they will stand up so they will lie flat they will relax because they want to make sure that they don't track heat they want to release heat the other one we can also mention about this adrenal gland we can mention about the smooth muscle we can mention about the blood vessel so when you feel hot we have thing called vasodilation what is the vessel dilation vessel dilation means that the blood vessel becomes bigger in size where they can release more heat so that's why after exercises right your face will turn red the reason why your face turn right is because that you try to release heat like not some girls or some boys to exercise their face turn weight their ears turn away because our skin of the face and the ear is very thin that's why you can see the redness in their face so if you don't know might use based on what you understand when the person carrying out exercises after a person carry exercises it's the same answer as this one okay we're gonna write ten sentences for lisa first you can say that the one that detects the changes in the body so if you want to detect a changes based on temperature what is the receptor known as guys what is the receptor known as the one that detects the temperature the receptor it is known as thermal receptor okay it's known as thermal receptor because heat right thermoreceptor if you want to detect changes of water because osmo receptor if we want to detect the blood pressure we call it as a barrel receptor if you want to detect concentration of carbon dioxide required as chemo receptor so this one nothing to do with the adh nothing to do with the adh at all oh nothing to do with adhesion you just based on the negative feedback of temperature okay you can flip to your notes or flip to whatever exercises that you have is under negative feedback of your temperature so the one it detects is called turmoil receptor okay so you can see thermal receptor thermal receptor in hypotenuse i don't know just now someone mentioned hepatitis i'm not focusing and skin detects the changes oh yeah detects the changes to detect the changes in body next we can talk about vasodilation occurs vasodilation means your blood vessel dilates it's called vasodilation because the other one is called vessel constriction right vessel constriction is the other thing already is vasodilation and then you can talk about a smooth muscle around a smooth muscle contract no muscle not contract relax most move muscle relax it increases amount of blood flowing through skin more heat is lost to external environment true radiation sweat gland is stimulated to secrete more sweat onto surface of skin heat is absorbed to evaporate sweat and these cools the skin and then we can talk about the erector muscle and you can see erector muscle in skin relaxes and hair is lower thin layer of air is checked between find hair so heat can be released quickly next part a we can talk about the metabolism process okay i changed another color uh for metabolism processor but it's the but you can write it in the same time you don't have to track anything just that to show you which one is better polishing only metabolism is a process that happens in the body which is more on hormones or more on the metabolism process like conversion of glucose something else so you can say skeletal are not stimulated and body does not shield the sugar means you when you feel cold you will shiver your body right in chinese it's called santo santo i think it's called okay i think it's called means when you feel cold you have the reaction that you shake your body and then adrenal gland and thyroid gland are less stimulated that causes no secretion of adrenaline and thyroxine adrenaline from the adrenal gland thyroxine is from the thyroid gland next you can see rate of metabolic lowers so this is the answer can oh you don't have to separate which one is a physical is it called physical physical and metabolic you don't have to separate just like everything that you know when a person stands under the hot day how do they want to regulate back to normal normal body temperature the red face is not because they are shy because when the person is shy it has the same reaction as well when the person is shy the the blood becomes bigger so they have more more blood flowing so when the person is shy right they will feel hot as well there will be this hit also or like whenever you see someone here you like passed by you like or whenever you see the k-pop artist you will scream right then your face will turn right right yeah if you're excited it's the same thing also not heat receptor no it's got turmoil receptors what about drinking alcohol drinking water is the same as well drinking alcohol is the same thing same thing okay it's the same thing as this one so during coding you shouldn't drink alcohol because when you're drinking alcohol during cold day you will not cool down your temperature it means you don't keep you don't feel shocked okay you only release more heat and you feel even cold when you drink alcohol during cold days so you shouldn't drink alcohol during kodai those k-pop drama no k drama is a wrong example because not during k drama they like to drink alcohol during cold day right you will feel even cold after you drink alcohol during coding okay so this is the answer next one b it says uh malaysia records okay i read the entire question first okay malaysia because the highest fat population in asia sha'allah malaysia is recorded as a country with the highest obese population in asia the tweet on the twitter website of the ministry of health malaysia in conjunction with world diabetes day to day the minister explained that until november this year malaysia was the fattest country in asia because 33 of the people were overweight and 80 were obese what is the difference between overweight and obese okay because this due to b and islam overweight and obesity is worse obviously it's obese overweight for bmi y shot is 25 to 29.9 obese is 29.9 to 34.9 this is the b and ida based on the bmi but don't have to know also never mind last april health minister datto srizuki ahmad also announced that malaysia as a country with highest number of obesity population in asia since 2015 he said that the statistics were very worrying because obesity was one of the main factors for large number of chronic diseases obesity and diabetes are too closely related health problems this is because unhealthy eating habits will affect increase in blood sugar level that results in health problems based on above statement explain how blood sugar level can be regulated but for real malaysia has a lot of people with diabetes and also a lot of people with heart problems like for real one this one is like for real one okay so for those who like to drink boba tea or whatever thing you have to make sure that you reduce the intake of sugar if you really like to drink adrenal gland and thyroid gland detects what aeronautical thyroid gland is the one that produces hormone adrenal gland agent leans is the one that increases your blood pressure paragon is the one that cyclic thyroxine is the one that regulate metabolic increased metabolism rate okay okay so over here we will talk about how do you want to regulate your blood glucose level based on the person has diabetes when a person has high sugar level we have to lower down right so if you want to lower down we have to secrete the hormone the hormone required as insulin okay type 2 diabetes correct is like typical diabetes you have to reduce uh we have to reduce glucose level by having a lot of insulin because excess glucose will be converted to glycogen by using insulin where they are produced from the pancreas the better cell of color of langerhans if you want to write that also can but if you don't want to write also can it's in your three books that are the thing the island of langerhans the better cell and the alpha cell is in your syllabus but if you don't know maya guys just write insulin and glucagon is enough already so insulin is a common excess glucose to glycogen and the glucose was stored in liver or muscle cells so when you have too much of glycogen because glycogen is like a power bank like power bank it will be full right so when it's full right all of the glucose it will store as a fat and of course you have to make sure that you use the glucose you have to make sure you use the glycogen you use the fat as energy so you can convert the glucose into energy by carrying out cellular respiration inject insulin yes correct you can inject insulin but this one could have to inject insulin just based on your human body can already because human body we can also produce insulin unless you have diabetes then you have to inject insulin so actually this question just right when you have a high glucose level how do you want to regulate back okay when you have a high sugar level how do you want to regulate back that is the thing that you have to take note to write so first you can say when blood sugar level or blood glucose level also correct is estima is above the normal range bacter cell of eyelet of langerhans pancreas is stimulated okay but if you don't know the eyelid of length hence beta cell of eyelet of langerhans it is okay guys if you don't know this one it's okay don't have to write this pancreas is the one that secrete insulin not liver is pancreas liver is the one that converts glucose to glycogen only and then next one it secretes insulin into bloodstream insulin convert excess glucose into glycogen in liver okay liver liver is the one that converts it will store in the liver all right okay and then you can see excess right sorry by collagen never mentioned about glycogen and glycogen star in liver and muscle cell muscle cells you can store that's why it will turn into fats at your body okay next excess glucose convert into lipid this reduces blood glucose level remember if it's a negative feedback mechanism always write reduces blood glucose level back to normal range okay back to normal range you cannot say just reduces blood glucose level because this is a negative feedback mechanism what is a negative even mechanism means it means you have to go back to normal range only can consider it as a negative effect mechanism if it's not then your answer is not correct law okay if you want to say increases you can you must also write increases back to normal range so for every homeostatic question or negative feedback mechanic mechanical question you have to wreck decreases back to normal range or increases back to normal range you have to say back to normal range where is the ecosystem question but for chapter eight the mangrove form question is from okay can okay now next question question eight question eight this is a chapter six question diagram a shows a sample serving based on malaysia healthy plate malaysia healthy plate illustrate the relative quantity of various food classes in a balanced diet teacher why not glycogen to leave it not glycogen to repeat its glucose to lipid glycogen is a storage it's a power bank so it's not glycogen it's real close to liquid okay because when you break down fats you break that into glucose you don't break down into glycogen you get what i mean when breakdown fat is straight away into glucose already by closing into glucose fat into glucose explain the importance of having a balanced diet to a diabetic patient so again this is what this is a diabetes patient of course if a person has diabetic right you have to reduce carbohydrate make sense right because carbohydrate it has sugar monosaccharide disaccharide and polysaccharide means sugar such as fruits fruits um milk milk rice dosa carbohydrate fruits you can eat foods for diabetic patients but they have to eat foods that is not sweet banana is a good example that is not sweet it's the one that provides potassium you can eat green apples you can eat pineapples but you cannot really eat like sweet food like grapes too sweet already like a watermelon that is too sweet they cannot eat that they have to eat like they're not sweet not sweet fruits a bit salad but yes this is true so you can consume a balanced diet by eating lesser rice drinking enough water eating foods eating protein enough of protein as well based on this one you can just try what you understand here and when you eat vegetable and fruits right you are not trying to increase your blood sugar level you are trying to help in peristalsis so it's easier for them to absorb easier for them to break down as well reduce protein no protein will not cause protein don't cause diabetic unless the person really needs a lot of energy then only they will convert protein into glucose which is blood sugar level but usually when you eat protein they will not increase your blood sugar levels so you can eat protein that's why people who want to be fit right they will stop all the carbohydrates just eat protein like chicken breast those if you wanna but i'm not the person who got that extreme hitler so you can see reduce intake of carbohydrate but a need to ensure they receive sufficient energy to carry out daily activities because if they have no glucose right then it's very hard for them to survive also right like no glucose if the person is like who likes to do dreamer then how then cannot do more no energy brown rice is a good choice guys and you can see reduce intake of fatty food or you can say oily food or you can say food that is high in cholesterol which is the bad cholesterol the low density lipoprotein oily food or whatever cholesterol also can this is to reduce the risk of having cardiovascular disease or you can see arterial sclerosis also can blockage of blockage of artery in the blood vessel okay next we have uh next i continue with this one i haven't finished this sentence yet we use these of having a cardiovascular disease which may leads to stroke or heart attack but it depends on whether whether it is a cardiovascular disease or not the symbol means that the symbol means is dislike or what you guys don't skap me with the symbol okay heart attack okay so stroke guys remember means the blockage is in the brain okay heart attack means that the blockage is in the heart so if you want to talk about cardiovascular disease the example is is heart okay can give can only give ec without hurayan uh if you have no explanation then you can give easy or you can give the statement only i mean it's acceptable now okay but you have to make sure that you you explain for some of the point because not every point you can explain but if you can explain you must explain okay okay thanks okay so next one is what increased intake of vegetable and fruits but as i mentioned are the foods that you eat you have to make sure that there is not sweet huh okay next one you can say this one is to promote hairy celsius is to avoid constipation if you have any blood clotting mechanism area in your body you can also use vitamin k or calcium ions to help in blood clotting mechanism so that's why it can also helps in quick recovery enable quick recovery if you have any related disease that you need to use vitamin another one you can see manage body weight you can manage body weight by controlling blood glucose level by reducing intake of glue of of carbohydrate so that this one can reduce risk of infection okay why is because that um if you have diabetics my literature shy and diabetic monitors right when you have a cut on your hand you are very hard to recover from it is because that the blood flow is very slow the reason why blood flow is very slow is because of people with diabetic mellitus right they their blood vessel is hardened so when it's hardened the blood flow is low so that the blood coating mechanism occurs very slowly so that's why you have infection when the wound is not closed so that's why people who have diabetic monitors they always go for operation when they have infection they have to cut the fingers cut the hands the amputation of prevent constipation yes the vegetable is the prevalent constipation vegetable okay is each explanation got marks yes got marks for each explanation this one one two three four five six seven eight nine ten and i think in front also got different one right so each of the point got one mark okay feature they want to they want they what uh what importance of balance diet yeah this is the balance diet yes so if you want to manage your body weight or by reducing intake of reducing intake of carbohydrates so you can reduce in the risk of infection balance diet means that food intake right anything related to food intake is here wrong cancer right applied on which kind of question usually wrong cancer right don't really happens in biology but i have to know always ask me wrong cancer right wrong cancer right means that you can only choose one okay for example now you have abcd as your answer a b c d okay you can only choose one answer right you cannot choose a b c d right you cannot guess your answer you cannot choose aug answers like for example right now you are talking about diabetes monitors you don't talk about other diseases like like people without diabetes insipidus is two different cases if you're talking about other different cases means your answer is totally wrong wrong they don't minus your means no one's only they don't like reverse and minus your mark you don't guess your answer you don't write everything you write whatever answer it is so you cannot guess your answer but they will not be wrong cancer right now so let's say right to answer for this one okay let's say to answers which they are opposite meaning means your answer is wrong also wrong wrong wrong wrong okay they will not be done just wrong on me okay um well i heard someone had faith without eating carbohydrate will have poor memory is it true noah there are a lot of people this day they don't eat carbohydrates like they don't eat carbohydrates they don't eat rice but they eat other other substances like for example they eat mouth they eat the fruits who's also carbohydrate so cannot say that cannot say that they are you know bad enough because they have other way of consuming carbohydrate even milk also considered as carbohydrate okay table it shows the nutritional information of a drink there's a lot of things here i don't have with the contender so what i want you to draw is based on table eight determine the total calorie of drinks if a boy sticks six glasses of drink per day shows your calculation so this one is the drink 250 ml heating six glasses you have to count your calories okay calories like for example one glass is how many are 250 ml right just now you highlight that thing right right now this boy here drinks six glass so means well 250 times six you get 1500 ml right i mean i don't know whether it's correct no but i think it's correct law okay next we have to count the calories okay what is the calorie they say every 100 ml is 62 calorie or you can use 205 250 ml as 155 calories whichever two also can okay whichever two also can so let's say i choose the 100 and l one left your choice are so the total calories will be 1500 divided by 100 because that one doesn't give you the answer times 62. so your answer is 930 calories hopefully that i got got to answer correct okay masa the best well all of you studying masa here is it well people myself okay all of you doctors still come and listen to my bio for what already year one year two already hello y'all okay next question uh this question here right actually never come up before so food processing question um food processing question maybe you have to take note but never mind we try one question for a milk question here it says meal processing is a process that involves the preparation of meal to ensure it is safe to drink either immediately or for a longer period of time based on the above statement explain three methods of milk processing so that it can last longer so three methods what are the three methods the first one we have pasteurization number two is uht ultra heat uh ultra heat temperature uht the third one is the refrigeration okay refugee refrigeration okay so for this sheet method basically you have to explain your answer why 62 the because the question give you for 100 ml is 62 you can use up if you guys don't know this one is you can also use 1000 okay okay let me show another one you can also use a 1500 divided by 250 times 155 okay so your answer is also 930 calories okay that's if you guys feel hungry don't worry guys you can eat later biology cannot study later three processes this is one for chapter six guys for those who don't know this is form four chapter six under food processing please go and read the rest of it there's a lot of food processing method a lot a lot guys it's a lot not only make a lot of please go and read it up so number one is pasteurization number one pasteurization yes no wonder the spelling soviet pasteurization p a s t e u r i s a t i o n okay pasteurization so what is the difference between pasteurization and uht very simple pasteurization means that you must put the milk in the refrigerator uhd means you can put it on the right like for example fresh milk always in the refrigerator like fresh palm are always in the refrigerator fish milk is a pasteurized milk all the fresh meat is pasteurized milk if it's uh milk you can put it in the room temperature for example good day meal and what brand i don't know guys okay good day maybe we can put it in the like room temperature so don't have to be uh refrigerator temperature like cold temperatures so pasteurizing you actually compare what is that compared to pesticide so these two things have different way of processing so for pasteurized milk right they have to heat milk at 63 degrees celsius for 30 minutes okay or aura or heat milk at 72 degrees celsius for 15 seconds okay then followed by rapid cooling below 10 degrees celsius okay 10 degrees celsius so it is able to kill micro organism without destroying nutrients content okay another one we call it as uht uh whenever you buy a meal please repeat the the box content of box they actually write pasteurization or they actually write uhd at the box confirm got one this one uh uht means ultra high temperature ultra high temperature so basically you have to heat milk at 132 degrees celsius for one second followed by rapid cooling the numbers the temperature you're gonna remember like guys okay this one like i don't have a way to remember the temperature but you just have to know the temperature okay so you actually have a higher temperature only but only they use it for one second okay so these are also same thing they can able they are able to destroy microorganism without destroying the nutrients content as well i like it again just in case you all don't know what i'm trying to say it's the same thing because no matter what kind of food processing you just want your food to last longer right destroying nutrient content okay next one we have the refrigeration like normal refrigeration refrigeration means you put it in a refrigerator okay refrigeration the milk is chilled at temperature of the temperature of temperature between temperature between negative 2 degrees celsius to 8 degrees celsius microorganisms are not killed but made in active at low temperature because you know some people they squeeze the milk from the cow and the goat they put it in the refrigerator right so this is the one it's pasteurization um how can the meal just be here for a short time just one second uh it's a technology like this one it's just a technology you have to know the technology that's only there no need to memorize immune it means you study for too late already this one people should know since what form four guys refrigeration okay food processing not only this one a lot of food processing also so you have to study the food processing okay next question question nine oh finally we are the last class last last last last question already so question nine you say is nine point one shows the dumping site at the kumbrong area malacca based on diagram 9.1 explain the effects of unplanned waste disposal on human health from garbage dumping and how to overcome the problem so same thing we have two questions here number one is effect of simply two rubbish number two how to overcome the problem you can write five five you can write uh six four you can write seven three so it's your choice as long as your answer you've got ten sentences your answers are correct okay ten sentences you're gonna also do but you'll make a funny question uh because i don't teach at uec i don't teach like people who study uec i don't i don't teach that i only teach spm student so yeah i don't really like translate into like specific terms for biology unless you are from uec law like that is different already and it seems to remember this temperature sorry i have no tips i just remember so maybe you can just remember i have no things to remember temperatures sorry guys okay yo lee once okay hanyu can eat dinner later guys okay later okay number one let's talk about effect first guys effects effects okay you can write five five as i mentioned calorie seven three you can write six for your choice what is the effect of simply throwing rubbish into the into the water number one of course you have water pollution right so all the water pollution when humans drink the water obviously that human gonna get different disease besides that it affects the apartheid animal in the river not only aquatic animal even aquatic plants also be affected so the entire food chain will be affected as well so um the landfill it will be filled with a lot of methane gas because this is not just water pollution right that's like dumping psych there's a lot rubbish in the area so if there's a lot of rubbish right it means that um they will release methane gas meeting yes it's a very smelly guess it will cause pollution as well okay there's a lot of pollution as well actually in malaysia we have a lot of dumping area we just don't live in a dumping area but after a few years they will use the dumping area as a housing area so some of the houses when your house is built above the or the rubbish right when they decomposer your house will become lower let me actually say that okay okay can okay okay so for effects you can write a waste product breakdown that release food component into viewer water these causes human to have health beasts when humans obtain water from river okay next one we have animal shy okay so you can see these also effects aquatic animal and plant which leads them to death next landfill gases such as methane gas have been released release these causes health problem such as such as such as a a cancer respiratory problem and then we have flies which are vector of illness it will break faster causing cholera and cholera diarrhea food poisoning poisoning guys later i read your message again let me write finish entire thing because if i cannot i cannot focus uh okay so let me write the entire thing first stagnant water also an ideal breeding a grounds or mosquito mosquito carry and spread disease such as malaria and dengue okay since right now we can write ways to overcome um ways to overcome actually you can always write the reinforce the law we can write a campaign or whatever or you can write videos we use recycle 3r because it's campaign right so you can always promote the campaign idea reduce we use recycle kind of thing so you can say a videos we use recycle you can if you are able to explain three point it means you get three ways to overcome already but you only write videos we use recycle right you only get one point you know okay so you have to expand our videos we use recycle reduce amount of waste by not using anything that cannot be decomposed practice reducing practice reusing reusing of use products that are still in good condition like for example the old hooks that you can use it for like to wash the color the old clothes you can use it as the the thing that you put on the floor so you can wipe your lid now so don't have to like always throw away that you can use right okay next one we have for organized recycle campaign to raise awareness of citizens okay so this is the answer um let me read whatever i think you all say first [Music] fish is the question mentioned about effects on human health okay correct the question asked about human health right okay just now i write the point the breathing ground of course not being this is the one affects the aquatic animal and plants which leads them to die right okay if you want to write this point you can write when human eats the animal or plant we get the disease okay we can write that but let's say you only write like that okay that's it i didn't i didn't explain this answer right okay i didn't accept anything from here right this point here is a wrong answer so if this answer is wrong right well they have wrong cancer right no this is there's no wrong cancer right because this statement is also correct just that it don't fit my answer it doesn't fit the question but i'm not trying to guess my uncertainty is wrong so this one there's no wrong cancer right unless you're able to accidentally answer that so you can say when human is the aquatic plant or aquatic animals from the beaver we get the disease then you can write that you cannot write vod because this is not uh related to human for bod okay can i can i use biodegradable no not biodegradable for cannot be most cans you can write cannot be biodegradable hello don't talk about the medication here okay no one understands you all guys you are biliary okay but water imported the e coli e coli it has advantage it has disadvantage sometimes uh in your body with eat collagen as well so we can able to digest we are able to digest by using e coli just that when it collects outside your body it's not a good thing anymore e coli causes urinary tract infection for female so yeah it's not a good thing when it's outside it's only good when it's inside so this is the question nine okay next one b nugget 9.2 shows three type of disease that cause a type of pollution we have asthma coughing swollen eye name the type of pollution and discuss the step that can be taken to prevent the pollution so same thing name the type of pollution and discuss the step step okay so over here over here in this question obviously you have asthma coughing and swollen i right this is air pollution so as pollution air pollution we have to explain how do you want to prevent the pollution where does air pollution come from air pollution come from the factory come from a vehicle right obviously these two area right so you want to reduce the combustion of fossil fuel so that there's lesser gases is being released you can use public transport you can use a shared car or power pulling to reduce emission of gases you can install a catalytic converter so that you can convert the hazardous gases to harmless gases you can what else can you do uh okay let me right first okay i'll write i'll remember what i can write a car okay talking about car okay you can use reusable energy so you can use solar energy you can use electrical energy so that you don't have to burn the you don't have to burn the combustion of fossil fuels so that you don't release to the atmosphere so there's no air pollution and so it's like the name one mark so the rest of the nightmare track you can explain how do you want to overcome okay so this is under phone for chapter 9 like is the question that usually come out for for chapter 9 but not this question i'm saying like for more chapter night it will come out okay i'm not saying that discussion but air pollution you can focus as well because not my potential cleaning of ozone layers sorry think of ozone layer so this is ah pollution so for air pollution we have to explain how to overcome right so you can see uses public transport or carpooling to reduce the emission of smoke uses renewable energy reduce burning of coal petroleum petroleum and fossil fuel next one uses natural gas vehicles or you can use solar energy vehicles reduce emission of smoke from exhaust of vehicles use unleaded petrol reduce incomplete combustion of fossil fuel or you can see emissions of a reduced emission reduce emission of lead to environment a last one you can install catalytic converter so as you install catalytic converter you can convert yeah convert [Music] tesla expensive lahore of course um i mean we are rich enough of course you can buy tesla uh there are also electric cars in malaysia that is quite affordable but the distance is very short short distance not to say you can travel to pinning now that's not quite possible unless you drive a tesla plants tree plants tree can only absorb carbon dioxide you cannot absorb carbon monoxide and sulfur of oxide of nitrogen so cannot okay report police for open planning there's not required here to write report policy guys okay ken so this is one for chapter 9 actually for chapter 9 it will be your question in exam depending on whether you want to do that question or not because a lot of times it's like preserve and conserve how do you want to overcome what uh what are your ways to overcome there's a lot of thinking there's a lot of thinking in chapter 9 so if you are not very good at it i mean of course you can skip the chapter if it's not that of course you can always choose this one because it's an open question open question has a lot of other answers besides the answer in the marking scheme but unless you're very good at ela okay if you're not good at common sense that's too bad for you don't choose this question so it's your choice for you to do that okay so we are done with malacca paper too um any question that you want to ask me before before your bio paper you can ask me i can slowly answer you okay slowly answer your question um fisher why the furion seems like almost the same because you only want to reduce air pollution but anything that related to air pollution you can write that but not also can you can reinforce the law if you want to write this you can write if we enforce the law by making sure that you can find the thing now find the guy who break the law or you can say raise a venous law also cannot that one okay so remember teacher is the dominant allow a dominant gene that shows the trait of the phenotype the dominant gene and dominant is the same thing we don't draw gene out we only use allow like for example the shape okay the shape is height okay but we cannot draw a gene out right okay we can only use like what you can only use like allow what is allowed aloud is t or like no small t big t uh this one is the allow this is the dominant this is the recessive allow so these are the allowance that we have to know so it's called alola gene and allah is the same thing trace is like height trait is like skin color those are called traits okay easy and foreign or together only one ec what mean like your statement will make your easy one you see so if you have more yeah means you have more marks if you're able to explain more statement is on mark each of your explanation is normal so please remember one reminder again your i say question it must be in a sentence form guys okay it must be a sentence for what about cryotype do we need to draw no need to draw cryotype cryotype only they will give you in a diagram cryotype only have to only have to focus on the 21st pair and the last pair of the chromosome so because when the first pair is down syndrome right the last pack is the trisomy exa klinefelter syndrome the tana syndrome so you only have to focus on 21st part in the last pack don't have to know how to draw one just look at the number of chromosomes digital is the difference between duplication or replication of dna um there is no replica there's no duplication of dna there's only duplication of chromosome so it's replication of dna and duplication of chromosome in s phase okay in space for example the offspring will show trip because of the dominant allow is that correct you have to see which one is dominant if tall is the dominant then it means it will show the torque characteristic i don't want to answer your question okay you want to ask your lecturer this one okay any other spm question that you want to ask me okay what is this cryotype google cryo caviar you google your priority then you know what is cryo type already feature can my structure answer in point without complete sentences i mean i start my sentence without subject like this like this is what this is what try to make it in to a full sentences okay catch it in the full sentence don't just write keyword because not every teacher you know a lot of time you have to pray for a good paper and also a good teacher because some teachers when they mark right they don't mark so straight they only see like keywords but some t-shirts they really like mark the keyword mark the entire sentence so you just don't only like pray for like good paper you only have to you also have to pay for a good marker guys so my suggestion is write it in the short sentences that is the best one short sentences okay means it's a full sentence that's just sentences do the ac apply wrong cancer right wrong kind of sms no i just want to give you a good example already what is wrong cancer right if the question asks about human but i got one point referring about aquatic animal and plants will my answer wrong means like why get wrong cancer right no i don't get wrong cancer right as soon as i don't guess my answer my answer is not wrong cancer right okay is it important to learn chromosome and gene mutation duplication and translocation yes yes you have to know the example uh maybe if it's not coming out for paper too then for paper one you will see the question because as i mentioned paper one you cannot you cannot cannot cannot skip the thing um is it uh if the question asks to compare do we need to draw a table or write in paragraph it is compare question you can draw in table but only instruction only in ac question if it's easy question you only can you only can like make sure that make sure that you can drag it in tableau if it's structured question in sentences pretty hard for get a chin chai teacher that much for you okay uh in if in point form doesn't it affects the mark your point form must be in sentence guys okay in sentences this one my answer here okay for example the screen here that i'm showing you this year sharing is here right you can see this is a point form right but my answer is in sentences for this question discussion that i'm writing is in sentences so this is the full sentences already is his point but it's in full sentences sleep in hundred mark in your paper don't teach bad people like that teacher this year were it's online learning that's the teacher will discuss some weird answer after marking no no they don't discuss one okay you mean what your your spm i don't discuss okay never discuss any tips for paper tree i think experiment you graduated already what teacher please explain about light and dark reaction i already explained here you didn't attend the class just now is it i explained since the first question already you rewind back to the first one okay guys hey anybody question you want to ask me please ask me

you have the answer for a lot of parts already please at least try to write or find the correct mv and are we please don't leave it blank for paper tree okay guys paper tree question one value needs to put harmonies you know place two decimal place because you need to draw a graph there's a calculation right okay two two decimal place is not ready so that's after you count you put it into two decimal place unless you are able to draw a graph with three decimal place okay but two decimal places is very good enough already teacher can speak true schematic diagram and punnett square what do you mean final square and i mean like you have to read the question nitrogen cycle is it possible for these to come up nitrogen cycle is a question that have not come up before yet i can only tell you this one i cannot say it will come up or not but i can only tell you that you haven't come up before what is the difference between gene mutation and chromosomal mutation gene mutation they have different arrangement okay like different they have four different four different types of gene mutation and chromosomal mutation so you have to read through the what are the differences like for chromosomal mutation they have like translocation they have deletion so you have to know the differences between gene mutation and chromosome only the names are different only okay that's all feature from five chapters which chapter is important for ac that it will come out um form five chapter three and chapter four chapter three and chapter four you can be true for ac but if the question is five chapter five it will be together with chapter six which is the punnett square question final square question if it's ac question it will be 10 marks if you are studying for punnett square question

paper two people also got people too so good is poland green important poland green came out last year and the year before actually double fertilization right are you trying to say double fertilization came out last year and the year before already okay nitrogen cycle please oh my god that is a very long process guys okay if you want to learn a very fast way of nitrogen cycle i can tell you a youtube website um you can search nitrogen cycle animation at youtube okay there's a youtube animation that video is very good video you can understand very well from i think it's what smart whatever it's for kids to study one that one that one's a very good video nitrogen cycle teacher what is the technique answering paper too if the person with a paper tour um paper tool right the thing that i can only teach you right now is to do state paper this year like you spend three sets because you still have time right you have like less than 24 or 12 hours right you just spend you spam three set cannot ready feature what is the difference between complete circulatory system and incomplete circulatory system complete circulatory system means there is no mixture of blood like for

11 years ago don't compare 10 11 years ago okay guys you compare within eight years a long long long ago already two all night i'm still like the no four one or four two i don't know how old you guys i got five years old only you guys that is too long ago you compared eight years within eight years it's enough already eight years because 209 i don't know whether it's new sleepers or ocd though because previously they are old sleepers it's in bm formula teacher protometer in experiment which is photo minor the experiment which came up in paper triple meter there are two factors that haven't come up yet for photometer so you can have to study for tomatoes so there are four four factors affecting right so there are two factors haven't come up before so you can study for photometer but photometer experiment is very similar so you can just study paper tree really needs skill one when you have a skill when you try three four sector already right you already handle the skill of answering the paper tree okay you watched my video for paper she then you try by yourself okay teacher is it chapter four from five possible to compare to easy question yes reproduction question it has the chances of coming out an easy question if it's not that instructional question okay if 2019 come out before this time won't come out they don't come out in the same they don't come up with the same sub topic okay if it's same subtopic it means different question already they don't ask the same question it would be different question if it's the same some topic okay meter p-o-t-o chapter one vocal meter is chapter one four five chapter one rate of transpiration go ahead and study photometer p-o-t-o meter okay so i don't think you guys have any question right it has been like three hours and 21 minutes any other question i can give you all another chance to ask questions teacher for the anaerobic respiration implants by spam syllabus only have paddy plants also and also germination yes paddy plants and also germination only for anaerobic respiration implants and germination so maybe they will ask you during flood time why the plants would die something like that teacher ac two point four two point five yes ac question two phone four two four five if you're lucky enough three four four one four five if you're lucky enough oh my god julie i miss you actually teacher is there any recommended video better understanding resource factor no i don't yeah i think did i post video from business factor no i don't post video i didn't post video for visual sector you just search and

already then you study tip sock yes i can tell you you study everything already you study tips well roommate and rodents come out uh possible also because rominion also haven't come up for a very long

stp23 oh thanks yes i discussed resource factor in 2020 good thank you very much for reminding me feature labeling in paper 3 how many units you mean like section 8 is it section a 2 unit for the up for the uh recording data recording data you have to based on the question one like the question gives you how many you recommend you need for the first question the recording data if is after you calculate there's a calculation question right sometimes the calculation question they give you formula sometimes they don't give you formula so if they give you formula i think most of time they keep it familiar right if they don't give you formula huh you have to derive your own formula from the unit itself the right formula is for n max well okay i cannot know music so if you are about to derive a formula right and after you calculate your answer two decimal place is enough ready two decimal places all same decimal places because if you need to use your number your result to draw a graph let's say your answer is one point three three three four how good how are you gonna draw your graph so you round up into two decimal place unless your answer is zero point one two three four then you can use three decimal places because it's zero point something right but if it's like one two three then don't do that teacher for for what voila what is that and cambium is actually the cork and camping is for the support implants usually happens in secondary group secondary group is a it's a important thing if you want to study about five chapters that is secondary group they will ask about

yeah i think it is [Music] get [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] shout out to my dad [Music] get [Music] now you ain't gotta think twice damn your grandma gonna be loving it new jam it's a summer head dip like a chip two tops that's a double dip rocky side of size shake it like a baby rattle you know it's a hit we're riding elevator [Music] [Applause] hey", "mT0CgHS1RFM": "[Music] today's gonna really do an unboxing so what's in the box so we're about to find out here and if you if you look at the link anyhow or in my description is gonna tell you exactly what's in there anyway but I just got it literally just got it so I figure well I'll just do a review on it stand aside not so much a review I should really say just an unboxing because the review will come later down the road in regards to this item so yeah it's the venom Pro quad charger 100 watts by 4 power so you get 100 watts for each port or however you want to consider it it's not a big device at all by any means but it's the pecs a lot and I like that it does stand up and it's I mean it's been and they got nice stuff I like the way it looks it looks awesome looking I did see you know I've looked at other reviews for a while on it oh man I really want one of these guys and I have a charger I have either has one I have two Chargers and then one of them has one port and the other one has two ports and I was like this is kind of getting old you know I had to wait a while or one doesn't have as much power as the other I figure that's time to upgrade so I'm this venom one and I sell venom so I figure well what the heck man if I'm selling this stuff why not take advantage of it as far as you know they have nice stuff and they're they're a good company so I haven't seen anything really negative on him you're always gonna have negative stuff but overall it's seems to be a very solid company and this thing is nice it's not cheesy feeling plastic or anything like that still plastic but it's nice definitely like it man look at the amount so I'm just seeing this off for the first time as well but you get a lot of cables in there obviously because we have four ports on this now it's pretty good I know I like to mailboxes you know that that whole fresh RC smell and some of them you know charger as well so you have your balancing plug that's there all the way up to 6s that's nice so very nice on that and you get for those so a cool deal on that so all four of those obviously you gonna get for the other cables so I dunno okay so these have the XT sixties that are on it you have your Dean's so what I'm trying I'm thinking here you guys can tell me - again I'm always looking for input so it's not like I don't know it all and I don't think anybody should really in this industry tour most industries just think that they know everything you're always learning there's always new stuff that's coming out here someone's looking for input so I'm not that guy that thinks I know it all because I don't I know I'm starting to see a lot of people with like XT so that the sixties the nineties so if you guys have those let me know I do like XT 90s they have like a little cap that goes over it so you're not using more heat shrink your therefore you're just snapping the cap on and you're covering up you know your solder job there and it's a clean install so I definitely like that time to do the heat strength thing so much and you know the deans are they're nice but maybe they're getting a little bit outdated they may be known when you're running higher current and vehicles and draw a lot of amps these probably aren't going to be sufficient as far as the the t deans connectors anyway moving on that's not what we're talking about so much and obviously you have the other connections there these are I've seen like I sell red cap so they have this type banana bullet whatever you want to call it the official name for it these are ec5 I don't have anything that's ever had that a connection on there well if you've been there before with that those are those are scary and those things pretty bad those to me it to Maya connections that are there but yeah I mean as far as now you have the alligator clips that are on there so this can be plugged I believe you can yeah run this right off of your car yeah DC power okay so yeah hook up that plug it in boom boom yeah and you got so you could be running this right off of your car battery good luck starting it if you run me if you're charging up a lot of batteries so definitely wouldn't do it on my car I got a small little I got a Honda so it's basically got a lawnmower type battery it's a super small in there but anyway other than that you got your cables that come there so you get all four of those too that's nice I can't wait to get this kind of going but I figured I'd just kind of let you know if you hear something else that's going on and I'll do more on that as far as the full review so until next time this is Joe with om GRC give us a like thumbs up if you enjoyed the video but I'm gonna do more on it but until next time you guys take care later [Music]", "cHOIItmdTe0": "hey this is jay the Kansas Explorer

your favorite musical artists Today Chuck and I are sitting here with the legendary Brian Johnson of ac/dc Brian welcome to the show. Thanks so much for coming First of all, I have to ask you where where have you been for the last eight years? Well, you know, it's well, it's Malcolm and Angus have been sitting in a studio In 2003. I went to over joined the boys for about six weeks and I said, you know and I sang I tried some songs out and then I went away and I came back again for a second six weeks until we Literally ran out of the things were done and Marlon said. I'll tell you what Brian. Why don't you just go home? We'll give you a ring when we're ready. Because and I said, okay and that was the last I saw of them but I know that the boys wanted something special no, really really did and when Malcolm and Angus Make their mind up on something they are stubborn and there will not stop until they get what they want they are they're two stubborn guys when it comes to perfection not anything else and And the pair of them are different in the angus will bring a riff to the studio and yeah, you know It's all care But I'm not sure and Malcolm I listened. I wouldn't say that's fucking brilliant That's great in a second. Do you think so sir? so that's the way the word a brother's you know, and but when we go to the studio, I think We realized it was well worth waiting for because the riffs were just you know, magnetic You know, he he couldn't not bang your head do it and do whatever, you know You must have had a lot of free time on your hands. Well, I learned how to do crosswords. I Won the four hours of sebring and Mira's car I learned how to become a really fast racing driver. So I did some good things, you know And what else did I learn patience That's what I did. Can you tell us about the movie you executive-produced? Totally baked. Oh It's funny. It's funny. Isn't it a documentary? It's a pot human tree What human dream how did you come up with that? Well, it wasn't me a friend of mine Craig shoemaker Who was making my movie but this is the honest truth. I mean, I'm not gonna lie He ran out of money He said Brian, it's Craig here isn't to be quite honest I'm fucked. I've just been divorced a Wife's taking all our money I can't afford any songs To put on the movie because you have to Pierre. Well, I'm gonna I said, well, what do you want? He said could you write somewhere when oh, fuck yeah. Sure So what do you mean write some you said I'll send you the movie and see if you're gonna tell them So I said listen Craig, I'll do what I can sir I called cliff because cliff just lives about 90 miles down the road cliff to your fancy rate in the couple of songs He said I've never written a song with you. I went I said you've never written a song cliff he went. Oh, yeah, that's right And so when donor and meeting cliff sat in the studio and we wrote the chain gang song called chain gang on the road and a song called who phoned the law and would wrote another one as well and which was good as well and blood alley it was called and We'll sent them out there and the guy said ah, this is great because it's very funny songs, you know, especially who phoned the law I'll let you have a listen. I'm one day and And and then they said Brian and that's brilliant But I'm still 25 grand short Of doing that, you know the credits at the end of the movie we can't afford to do them and I went oh Jesus So I learned them the money and then the next thing I know on the back of the thing. I'm an executive producer I don't even know what an executive producer does it and Well, it was a funny movie and he still hasn't paid his back yet, but no maintenance I wasn't expecting it Brian weren't you also involved in the stage production of Helen of Troy? Well, they're working on that now in London, so I'm got me fingers crossed for that That's a very proud of that but you know, it's a tough market to get into that that thing you know But it that working on it now and hopefully we can get something going or not because it's a big production. It's orchestral or It's big Orchestra. Jovian. It's got nothing to do with rock and roll was just something I wanted to do You know something different just to see if I could do it really? But like a crossword On top of everything else you're racing vintage cars Arisa royale or pay for which is a 71 racer and But now I'm into the the big caused the Lamont cause and I just I just got myself a Pilbeam WS a three car which is Which is it's like, you know the Audi at lamang and a sim ship and everything and I just as I said I just wrist at Sebring and I was so excited okay, I'm third overall, but first in class and It was just the proudest moment, you know stand on the podium with a champion. Yeah, yeah And this German guy was standing next to me was a Porsche driver. Anyone you are you are I Know I have but I am Not sure you you you are singing with Ac/dc and I said, well, yes, I am anyone but this is not possible. I am a professional And you are chasing me. He came second and I went well, you know and even this is Shit. How old are you? I'm 60 anyone You are 60 and you are chasing me and then he was a lovely man I forgot his name and he just said before you go. I must have your autograph I said yeah sure for my mother He was joking, you know, it was a good thing, but I was very proud that this man Appreciated the fact that I was a good racer to me that's important I don't want anybody to think that just because I have the money to buy your first car that's why I started in the small cause I Wanted to earn the respect of the other race drivers without going in there with big flashy Crew and the trailers and the big car and people good enough You know, there you go. So I wanted to start right at the bottom and I did with a lotus. Cortina Mach 1 You know were them? 1963 and I had so much fun in that car on two wheels Round the corners fantastic. Don't get me started about racing. I get all excited I love it Getting back to the album. Why did you call it black ice? No black case was always I know when was Tony Mullen hang. We were talking about this title and all and I just and it was basically I remember when I was a boy and I had me motorcycle and I was had to go to work and On the radio in the morning. There's only radios then folks It's the ladies and gentlemen today The weather is very cold outside and please be careful of black ice on the roads And black ice was dangerous and it couldn't be seen and that was the whole thing about it it was this mythical ice that you couldn't say that could fucking kill you it could kill you and Many a time I used to end up with a motorcycle on top of us just sitting on oh, oh, oh Are you all right are you all right guys And they would help us out of it and basically When and we never forgot it, it was just one of them things that hit the northeast of England and Scotland Nasty shit nasty shit it was this album. It reminds me a lot of the classic ac/dc albums Is that way you were looking for? You know, you never look for anything, but yes, you're right it I think the thing you're thinking of which it hit me is the spontaneity about all the freshness the It's when I first heard it I had bumps on my arms because I Thought it was me 25 years ago. I thought I went to holy Sh shit It was it was it was spooky. I thought I was listening to myself when I was a young man and and And I can only put that down to Brendan or Brian or when we started the album He said to me he said Brian you don't like studios day. I said, I hate Judaism fucking hate it He said what don't you like about it? I said I don't like about it the way it's so formal But that when you stand there as a singer and there's a microphone there then there's bits of wood around it And there's their headphones on you and it's one two three and sing And the day then and There's nobody there and it's mechanical and I hate it and I Suz I'm not a great singer but I'm a passionate singer and that's how I do it and and I've got to have them making me hand and I have to be able to move which you can't do when there's a static mate you have that and And I think it's being able to tell in the last couple of albums. It's just been getting Almost mechanical and I wasn't proud of it, but there's nothing I could do and he said mmm, let me think about this The next day I came in And he said we're gonna sing in here And I said in there I said that's an office behind the reception desk with glass windows He went well, you got a problem with it. I went Well, everybody can see is when I coming in even well at least of people then I went okay And and he said you don't like headphones I went no I don't like headphones So he give us this big night big shoe of 56 with a big bracket on it It was like a wit And you had a little speak as it then I tell my son I just sang a rape out there scared the receptionist everyday poor girl. Oh Jesus and And a dog I said a big German Shepherd which kept howling, you know, every time I started sick. Oh fuck and Which I can't blame em But that's how it happened and I felt great because I was just singing to wit to Brendan and Bobbie Bowen who was just using little mechanical guy, you know and a tiny little desk and that was it So spontaneous, it was live And that was it, you know, I've noticed that the ac/dc albums they have a signature sound to them Is that what you were going for? That's what you do, you know, why did why venture and the places that you're not sure of? This is it You're not and those people are the kind of people that are always looking for the next sound Always looking to be hip I was looking to see yeah I've discovered a new band and they're just fantastic and I'm really into them at the moment And that's the word that gets you at the moment The gypsies the musical gypsies that just go from one band to the next whatever's hot and so as far as I'm concerned You know that that that they have no loyalties to anyone. That's alright fuck em that's called music and I can go fuck themselves and I don't want to be in the same car as them let's put it that way and Especially if they're in charge of the fucking radio Okay. Thank you The next party political broadcast will be next weddings, dear Brian on this album, you're writing lyrics again, you know, well, you know, it's not so much I wrote the lyrics it's helped it with melody and Just filling in gaps that I thought needed filling in so really that's my job you know I come in the boys come in there with the wit with the bulk of the thing and My job is to kick those lyrics up EOS put in lyrics will I need it if it doesn't make sense? And do a melody but basically the job is done by malcolm and angus and I think they did a fucking great job And to understand them. Yeah Sometimes you have to change Things and and and and it's and I love doing that because it's it's a crossword puzzle Again, I'm getting keep getting back to crossword puzzles and you still use that classic rock Vocabulary or one-lane. I'm very very proud of is on big Jack when it says big jack big jack Santa ain't the only one who's got a full sack. I'm very proud It's disgusting but that's what I'm all about folks. I guess you'll always be a kid at heart. Yeah Can I help it? You know that's a trouble. I'm going to do something Yeah, and you're really not that caught up in being a celebrity. Are you? Yeah It's just useless at being celebrities. Well, absolutely If there's one thing you say they say is useless at Its be in celebrity would just cannot do it. And if anybody did there with the rest of the band would laugh Well, we're just being it. What the fuck are you doing? You know, yeah, you're making the band look foolish, you know, don't do that when I when I recent make car I Specifically said, you know cuz the announcers I see intelligent. Mmm. The driver is Brian Johnson from Sarasota, Florida That's it, you know because I will bring the people in more people Please don't do that because my fellow drivers would think me an asshole They're gonna have and I don't want that, please I just want to be a driver and that's what I do You know and and that applies to all walks of life where I live in Sarasota Everybody knows who I am, but it doesn't matter Jerry Springer lives down the street from me and I see him running and he sees me running morning Jerry morning, Brian and that's fuckin it Do you think that you'll ever want to retire? Oh, yeah. Well I said, you know, I've always said it before started this album. I Met Brendan O'Brien for the first time and I said Brendan. Can I have a word with you, please? He said sure Brian. What is it? I said Renan. Will you make me a promise? And he said what is that? I said Brennan if I'm not up to scratch If I'm not up to the job Please please tell me I'm a big boy, though. I won't cry I'll just disappear I'll just say goodbye to the boys and they can get somebody else in to do the job and I really really mean it Because the last thing I want is to be the the member in this band That holds it all back and I mean that from the bottom of my heart I'm not bullshitting and I don't mean in any sentimental will whatsoever. It's the truth Because I'm a practical man, I don't you know, it's it's like a German engineer If he's father makes a piece for an engine and he's it's getting old and it doesn't do the job like a new piece can He's not gonna see it Well, it's me father's you know You get the new piece in to make that engine efficient and it's the same and me and music if if I'm gonna be the part that's Nicky I don't want to pay that part I'll go and just retire and have a bit of fun or sing other songs I'll sing something Jazzy, or bluesier, you know, which I enjoy very much as well and so and any and he looked at me and he went okay, and When he never said anything, so I was very lucky and as I enjoyed enjoyed singing and the album You know Brian the band has a long-term contract with Columbia Records Is there a problem with the label with the band if it takes you guys eight years to do a record? It's Obviously for me, you know I'd love to see more but at at 61 coming up and I have to have to prove to myself that I can't do two hours on stage You know, I have to prove to me So that's next hurdle if I go out in November and if after I'm sure the first two or three nights it's gonna be hard and it's gonna hurt And I've been working out to try to keep fit for that but excuse me, if if if I can't do it, well then I want I'll just say Once again, I'm gonna be the weak link in the band I'm sure there's a younger sing out there that can do the job because there's always somebody There's always somebody that can do your job. You're never the only one believe you me maybe apart from Tiger Woods Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton all care Right, they are special but there's always somebody right and he's us Sebastian Vettel just proved that this week. So You know, it's said that's my next hurdle. I'm looking forward to it, and I'm not afraid of it. I Want to know because I won't come on enough. I'm gonna be you know there for a year But after that to answer the rest of your question, I don't know If they said listen would like another album. This has been so fabulous Brian Would you do another album and another - I might have to sit no But physically I can't I would love to good. You know, I'd love to go out again But if I can't I can't and that's the unfortunate thing about being a human being you get fucking old It's just one of them things, you know, Brian one last question before we go What are your thoughts on where technology is taking music? I? Think first of all, the digital music thing is an important thing. There was especially I choose It's become a monster now monster. It's like, you know the old 1984 you know the movie night George Orwell, you know big brother I'll tell you what to listen to no, but I'd like to hear Paul Butterfield Blues Band We don't have that because nobody who asks for it, except you you have it. Can I can I download it? No, not until we tell you you can which could be next year Whereas if you had a little music store on the corner like you used to have I'll order it for you I'll get it for you and we're the only band left in the world know that has insane to iTunes and I'm not proud of it, and I'm not ashamed of it It to me, it's a fact that we want to Keep the fans in charge we want people to buy a record to a Physical thing not a number on a fucking download which is what it's turning into It's you know, it's people getting no you can just buy one or two songs off an album Alright, if an album shit, you know, that's all right You're silly but sometimes a band exists on album Nobody goes and to do a bad song some is it just turns out like that or whatever? But we believe people should listen to a band if they're gonna buy an album and this was pros and cons on both sides I know that but we're bringing this album out. I think it's the cheapest album out there It's got 15 songs on it and in upstairs, it's selling for eleven ninety Which is like seven euros for something like that And so it's cheaper than iTunes. It's cheaper. I mean, so swivel on this iTunes I'm not sure there's anything against iTunes but they've become a monster and that's what you're in that frightens me You know that could become dictatorial if they wanted to you know You know Germany can only have these songs because they were very popular for the last five years and these songs over here That's Italian, you know Zuker or say for instance. You can't buy that in England. Well, why not? I'm a zukor of fun. Yeah It's not worth it. You know, I mean, I know I'm Being extreme here, but it shit happens You know, and it's great to be independent in it just to be seen fuck you It's always good to stick a finger up to the big boys and just you know, you can't touch us I know you're strong. You can't touch us that's why when we go on to our we use the small promoters or their promoters that were with us from The very early days who give us a chance now you have these big corporations huge big corporations I just say remember last two-hour dinner you've said if you don't tell with us you never to her and we said fuck you and Would went with all the other ones it would did to her and it was a sellout this time that coming, please Would you would you come with us please? And we said fuck off? Again, Brian, it's been an incredible pleasure. Thank you very much. Thanks so much Brilliant.

"well this song we're going to do for you right now I had mentioned New York City Tommy James and the Shondells Wow three years before that there was a nightclub on the corner 48th Street and Broadway in downtown New York and it was called the peppermint lounge and there was what they called a house band in there at the same band played week after week and some of the greatest musicians were in house bands in New York and LA and Nashville and you never heard of them well this particular house band decided to make both themselves and the place they were playing in famous by writing a song about the place now the name of the band back in 1962 was Joey D and the starlighter's not to be confused with Rick and the all-nighters the name of the song was the peppermint twist where they got a new dance and it goes like this [Music] you learn to do this the peppermint when she go around round round round them up announce a 1 2 3 kick 1 2 3 jump [Music] it's alright it's okay it's okay [Music] [Music] [Music] one two three kick one two three [Music] [Applause]", "pLiTIUDDuqw": "hey guys today I'm going to show you how to pick out the correct AC DC adapter this is a very specific and important process that requires four major pieces of information to be successful using this particular product I'm going to show you the things you need to know and where to find them as well as a general idea of what they mean so let's get started and I'll show you what to look for now we'll take a look at the power supply here in a minute if you have that but if you don't this product tells us all four things we need the voltage the amperage the polarity and voltage type and why we would have to measure for it the plug type or size let's talk ACDC a C stands for alternating current and comes from the wall anything that plugs straight in is AC if it requires an adapter it will convert either AC to a lower AC voltage or AC to DC direct current flows in one direction and AC alternates back and forth this is important later when we need the polarity just a tip you may also see AC represented with the single squiggly line and DC represented with a straight line and a dotted one under it let's take a look at an AC to DC adapter real quick input meaning coming from the wall is 100 to 240 volts and 50 or 60 Hertz these are international standards and are simply a way of saying you can plug it in anywhere honestly don't worry about that practically all of these adapters can be plugged into a wall last thing here it says 24 watts this is just a way to say 12 V times 2a equals 24 watts wattage is another way to measure current output so you may need to divide it by the voltage to find the amperage you need all right let's take a look at volts here we see 12v now you may see anything from 1.5 to 24 v and in some cases a range like this if the product has a range then anything in that range will work but if these products deal with I do go for the higher option if possible it will just give it the optimal performance but for the most part if it says 12 only use a 12 volt adapter now here we see 2 a which means 2.0 amps for 2 thousand milliamp sometimes referred to as current or current capacity amperage is kind of tricky first of all let's talk about regulated and unregulated power supplies regulated adapters have a set voltage and only pull the amps they need whereas unregulated adapters voltage can change depending on the amps being pulled by the product if we decide to buy a regulated power supply we will need one that can supply two thousand milliamp or more let's say this adapter for instance can only deliver a thousand milliamps then the adapter would be working twice as hard and may overheat or even catch fire however if the product were calling for a thousand milliamp and the supply could deliver two thousand then it could adequately provide the current with no problem too much isn't a bad thing just never under the amount the product is calling for unregulated is different though if we decide to buy an unregulated power supply we need one that will supply the exact amount of amps no more no less or else we could inadvertently fluctuate the voltage polarity is what we determine from this symbol here as we know direct current only moves one direction the polarity tells us which direction it moves you don't want it going the wrong way so when we take a look here we see this product is center pin positive it may be negative and would look something like this but in this case we need an adapter that is center pin positive remember too that since AC alternates back and forth AC plugs will not have polarity lastly is the plug size like I said earlier we'll have to measure this but we need the pin size and barrel size in milimeters that's this and this typically the barrel size is going to be five point five millimeters and the pin size will vary again though typically the pin size is two point one or two point five millimeters so those are safe bets however this is a good time to mention multi adapters these power supplies have switches to change the voltage a large amount of amps to cover most bases and multiple switchable plug sizes that are reversible if the polarity is a factor this means you can use one device for a number of different situations and always have a quick spare adapter available so long as the multi adapter accurately adopts the main points we've discussed it will always do the trick not every product is going to have the main points of information readily available though so where do you find all this stuff this is a good order check near where the adapter plugs in first if not there then look for a plaque or sticker on the back sides or most likely the bottom of the product again if it's not there you can check the manual which will almost always include this information and if it doesn't or you don't have a manual you can always call the manufacturer to ask about the power specifications on a product keep in mind some power adapters are specific to products or may have their own model numbers so that will eliminate almost all the steps and make replacement a breeze knowing these things you should be able to find the right adapter and get on powering your products to find the right one for you make sure you visit Parts Express hey guys thanks

into a different kind of video than what I normally do I'm gonna be doing something I'm actually pretty damn familiar with well I'll say pretty damn familiar with have been covering this song for about let me think eight years something like that more or less since the first I'd learn to do this kind of vocal or whatever half-assed attempt at it is that I do because yeah I'm a classic rock you don't cover singer/guitarist whatever you want to call that play it always stuff been playing it for a long time so yeah I figured might as well do a reaction of something actually familiar with lungs because normally I'm always trying to do stuff that I'm not familiar with the more is responding to new things cuz it's the best way to learn I love doing reaction videos flat it is the quickest most straightforward way to get people to come to me with suggestions for stuff that I might be interested in that might be able to learn from so yeah it's novel for me to do something I'm familiar with it's ac/dc Dylan Thomas JA come pick the live version at Donington because it's one of the best [ __ ] live clips of them I've ever seen which is saying something they got a lot you know a lot of [ __ ] good ones look at that crowd for [ __ ] sake cannot imagine what we like to do a gig to them a crowd that big would be amazing yeah this songs awesome this was probably the song at first Idol arm I actually start to get the grips with doing yakov locust you know cuz until then it really struggled with range of really struggled with power really struggle with you sounding anywhere in the blue pipe what's trying to do so I'm gonna listen break down a bit what Brian Johnson's doing have a good time Cheers [Applause] [Music] that's [ __ ] good so far unusually OnPoint for Bryan Johnson [Music] [Music] okay so yeah right off the bat we've done the first verse there what we they've done the first verse we've got through it with them well done us but yeah phenomenally OnPoint let's say you check out a lot of life tips of ac/dc and sometimes Bryan Johnson's vocals they can be a bit I thought put it politely he sings like Donald Duck and that was how I started to learn to do this stuff it was parody cuz until then the only thing had ever really sort of been able to attempt was Green Day I really struggled with my range when I started singing this stuff listening to it as amazing as I think it sounds he come on he sings like Donald Duck that that quack like sound to his voice and it's why he's running so efficiently he is unusually on point with that that tone that brightness that attack he's really doing it there he's not covering up with a lot of distortion like he does at other gigs he's pretty [ __ ] clean here to be honest just a little bit about the score at sound in the right places yeah just barely it's like a tube amp set to clean but turned up loud you know it's just breaking up nicely really gives it that sort of tone that you're after doing this kind of material and yeah his range is on point it sounds amazing it's what I find fascinating with Brian Johnson is why I started learning ac/dc stuff when I started along Rock because vocally the range is in its high enough you're far away from your chest voice you're far away from your speaking voice you can get away with murder in terms of the tone you pick so long as you're getting roughly in the right kind of mix the right kind of gear and you've got a little bit of distortion on it will cut it it will do the job in a live environment you don't have to worry about being technically amazing as a singer it's not like trying to cover you know Steelheart something like that or bon jovi for example and don't be wrong we'll get started on bon jovi someone could live he butchers a lot of his songs but you can get away with a lot with this kind of vocal style it's why it was the first stepping stone I picked up in my path to trying to learn to sing rock stuff authentically again emphasis on the word but yeah Brian Johnson he's really bright he's barely outside a falsetto at times depending on the vowel he sings you can hear him drop into a falsetto kind of sound there you know you that you sound he's really soft really yeah it softens up quite a bit when you're in a vowel where the throats an hour enough and you can't really get the pressure and the distortion behind it yeah it's yeah again if you're looking to try to cover this kind of stuff start with your falsetto and try to distort it that's my advice it'll probably be easy and you trying to belt it start with the soft four so make it really piercing go from a to really make it that donald duck quack kind of sound let it distort that one record it and see how far you off from the ballpark of what you're after and then as you refine it and you get better at it he gets stronger you're able to mix a bit better it'll sound better and better but that was how I started and it really worked to open it up yeah I think I've rambled enough for now let's listen the rest of it for normal Y performance here I think he hits every high note he's supposed to which is not common for me [Applause] beautiful and full banner death note here this is now bright and softy is really [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [ __ ] on going down [Music] still getting there at the end it's impressive [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right leave that just yet listen again how bright how clear how piercing and again how comical his voice can be in places it's all really good I say comical it sounds like put them down I'm not but this is not like a talking voice being belted through it's not that kind of tone if you're looking to learn to sing hi if you're looking to get those piercing high notes if you're looking to get that kind of power that distortion that range forget about trying to drag your speaking voice up that is not what most rock singers are doing and Brian Johnson is a unique example don't get me wrong and this is an unusually good example of him on points there's a lot of performances where the Donald Duck's sound really starts to become too apparent he really leans too far that way but listen to him here every notes flowing out he's really getting in there he's really nailing that stuff finish because he's so [ __ ] bright and clear and he's not pushing he's not pushing too excessively trying to drag up too much weight he's just letting the voice sit in that area the distortions just clicking on he's got that kind of pressure that amount of air pressure that balance and yeah he's really getting in there listen again [Music] you listen to him when he's doing the narrow vowels on those left shops you know those are sharp fives which is pretty [ __ ] high and it's high only generally tends to get in a live environment listen to him do hells bells he struggles with that and that's not that much higher really but yeah when he's doing those narrow vowels the O and the e where were they see if I find him [Music] he's getting a pretty pure ooh which is tricky for a lot of rock bellas they'll tend to drag it'll become an O or broad you know it will broaden out and become distorted not vocal distortion is in a cool powerful effect I mean the vowels become impure you end up compensating you're trying to drag up too much vocal weight he's staying narrow his throat was staying narrow he's keeping the air pressure good he's really getting in there yeah on the fools it's really quite pure rules slightly distorted slightly imbalanced but really [ __ ] good it's a phenomenal bit I don't know what they're doing editing in post or whatever but it sounds like it's live it sounds like it's done really well and yeah it's brilliant and you got the shaking of the knees the narrow vowel on the knees it's definitely an e which is impressive that Heim with that much power with a vocal mix that cuts that much he's got that much projection there he's not going to shaking out the noise and distorting the [ __ ] out the vowel like a lot of people do he's really getting in there the vowels are pure again if you're looking to sing this stuff take note of that if you learn to get the narrow vowels and get enough projection and power in those you can broaden out you can make it sound cool you know if you're too broad it's really tricky to overcome the the compensations you'll have ones that you won't be aware of you will be using vowels that are too broad because it allows you to push more it allows you to push more weight but when you try to narrow it down you'll crack you'll flip it's why a lot of you if you've done a lot of vocal exercises in your time a lot of scales sirens whatever Lily exercises of the day are now I don't know I tuned out a long time ago but if you've done a lot of exercises and you find that you can hit notes in full voice there but you've struggle to do them in a song that's your problem that's your main problem you've probably done a lot of exercises neh-neh-neh-neh-neh-neh-neh or full voice sirens yeah these are fairly broad vowel exercises you know the issue I found with most home vocal programs and doing scales and stuff is that when you're working now our exercises it's too soft and when you're working the full voice exercises you're too broad you're pushing too much the balance is in the middle listen to these rock singers that are really good at this stuff again Brian Johnson he's really nailing those narrow vowels in that range here at least I won't speak for the rest of his performances but here it's all on point and you need to practice that you need to get your full voice working with those narrow vowels that is where your voice should be set up that's where it should be balanced that's where you should be trying to coordinate it because if you can get those you can do the rest of the vowels you can broaden out you'll stop having issues translating from doing a scale where you can go yeah and hit whatever notes you can hit you'll start to be able to hit them in songs work on songs make sure that you get the sound right and you get the vowels right don't distort the vowels trying to get a heavier or more powerful sound keep the vowels pure and welcome as best as you can and broaden out because I say it's what allows you to perform to this kind of level and so it allows you to perform consistently and keep things working well in your voice it'll stop you having inconsistent bits or words that you struggle with you stop getting tripped up so yeah again listen out your favorite singers and hear what they do when they hit vowels like ooh or ear they distorting are they going out to broader ones is it splatting out does it sound a bit funny are they breaking you know and listen to yourself record yourself and listen make sure you're getting that stuff right because it's very important very important okay listen I know it's wet [Music] as well on point [Music] [Applause] [Music] here we go [Applause] [Music] [Applause] nothing really noteworthy that he's already done only impressive stuff just yeah really good [Music] and it's younger than this thing that's warranted during reaction videos really more calling on my chair [Applause] and that's important listen to them there this is another important thing if you're looking to develop vocal range and power and all that stuff it's my camera getting blurry I don't know in mind I'm having troubles with it recently but yeah if you're looking to develop range and power you got a bear in mind as well you can't start from the bottom up and try and hope that you're going to develop balanced voice if you start from the bottom with your chest voice and try to drag that up and develop from there you all nine times out of 10 you'll - you will develop some sort of imbalance because to make high notes work you need to develop the bits and the muscles and the coordinations and throat that make high notes happen and it's a different thing from your speaking voice listen to Brian Johnson doing these low notes he's not really heavy he's not like a proper Basie Woofie it's not deep and wolfy or powerful like that he's quite bright listen I [Music] [Applause] Wow Wow you can hear that brightness to it you know I mean you can hear its yeah there's a there's a narrowness to it there's a brightness again his vowels are incredibly broad he's not leaking excessive air it's pretty good you know [Music] [Applause] [Music] just yeah he's not excessively weight either there's nothing that's gonna trip him up when he tries to go high again [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah well it was sudden diamond will stuff like tend to poke someone technique and try to avoid getting too technical but the end though they just weren't doing kicks ass I say it's a bit comical in isolation he does sing like Donald Duck but it sounds [ __ ] amazing Internet mix we distill it gets has and loud runs and thunderous bass it cuts beautifully it's right there in the mix no problems you're not gonna struggle to hear him yeah he sounds [ __ ] phenomenal [Music] he's on pitch the power is that he's not distorted to the point where it sounds stupid just yeah it sounds like ac/dc a phenomenal [ __ ] rock band it's important as well as you point out too much but when he's in his main sort of comes the area around hi-c you don't see him straining much there's no funny faces there's no real compensations there's no muscular tension like that on his high notes a little bit but generally he's not really straining much he's not pushing too hard to make that sound you see if I can find some examples [Applause] [Music] yeah tiny bit but nothing major he's not doing anything funny really past year or whatever [Music] [Applause] [Music] see one's a bit more [Music] not really you can see that he's bracing a little bit but that let's support that's breath support on a nutshell you know he's locking down a bit with his sauce or to be able to project properly with that but that's part of it when you sing high when you sing in a physically demanding way you've got to put some energy in you know and that's as far as I go we're thinking about breath support really I think it's a massively convoluted topic in most vocal circles you've got to give the sound the energy it needs but if you're making the right sounds if you're using the right vowels of using the right kind of sound your body will let you know if you're putting enough energy and so I wouldn't worry too much about breath support unless you've really got an obvious problem to be honest look at your favorite singers and look at what they're doing they're not typically doing something funny in terms of breath support with breathing in and pushing their stomach out or sucking it in you can see with most of them when they're singing again Brian Johnson that a little bit earlier one in a fix where is ready it's obvious he's looking down at the stomach [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes you know he's locking down a bit but it's not a massive strain it's not like he's really you know what's the word I don't know but he's not using excessive force he's doing it but it's fairly easy it's like watching an athlete you know play a good game or whatever sport they're good at there's a physical effort required but doesn't mean that it's strenuous it doesn't mean that's necessarily hard work it looks effortless okay it's pretty loose he's moving his form with it you know expressing some of that tension somewhere but it's not in his throat that's the important point as long as you're not creating any problems in your throat with the amount of effort it takes to sing you're probably okay the effort will have to go somewhere which is why breast support gets talked about so much but generally songs it's away from the throat you're okay so don't overthink that if you're an aspiring singer [Music] [Applause] he does start to you know know fast a little bit but as he gets to get a higher notes he does start the struggle of work you can see it there which is probably why he's a bit inconsistent live as far as hitting them this is one of the best performances hands down that I've seen you see some of his other ones and he does struggled with consistency in the high range but that's neither here nor there I think I've rambled enough about this for now the main points I wanted to make with this video doing this kind of vocal was the stepping stone I found to get my range to develop because it allowed me to start using my higher range in some kind of gear again when I started I was just using force out and using distortion to make it work and it was a bit bit of a bit of force required to make that work but it did start to open things up and develop my voice if you're looking to learn to do vocal range I would suggest trying some ACDC some Brian Johnson or ac/dc do it in falsetto try to use a bit of vocal distortion look it up on the CVT a complete vocal technique website I think it's called look up there examples of distortion try to make those noises in your falsetto or work on your falsetto to begin with if you struggle that much because it lays a really good foundation for developing your vocal range in a healthy way with the right kind of balance that allow you to be able to sing efficiently through that range I highly recommend it give that stuff a go imitate some of these noises with you know what Brian Johnson is doing because for me it worked beautifully it allowed me to use my falsetto to try to do this kind of material and that was a stepping stone as I got better at that my voice developed more I started to work on more full sounds and went from that but it laid such a good foundation I can't recommend it enough and it's why I've done this reaction video today so forgive me because it's a little all over the place with the rambling but yeah I think I covered most of the main points I wanted to pay attention to what your favorite singers are doing listen to the vowels are using listen to the sounds they're doing the effects they're using is it distorted is there vibrato you know things like that and just write it down write the lyrics out write it down what pitch they're doing what effects they're doing you know take know of how much effort it seems to take them and be careful with that because a lot of live clips will be edited but try to find the roar it's live ones you can and take anyway that's about it I love this performance I hope you guys enjoyed watching it with me hope you've enjoyed my reaction I hope to see you in the next one feel free to suggest different ones I'm up for trying anything and yeah hope to see you on the next video take
