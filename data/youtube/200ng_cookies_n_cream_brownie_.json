add some sugar then crack in 2x we're gonna add a little bit of flour a little bit of cocoa powder vanilla maybe a little more yeah and a pinch of sea salt and I love using sea salt because there's no aluminium in there I like to get all my vitamins and minerals everything from my food except for maybe some Sun vitamin D and that's our batter foolproof and easy we're just gonna pour about half the batter spread it around and then just start adding your cookies you can leave them whole you can cut them in half like I'm doing here whatever you want top your Oreos with the rest of that batter

"[Music] hi everybody welcome back to back roads leaving YouTube channel today we're going to be making a cookie and creams brownie this is my first time for this particular brownie we've made several brownies over the years but not the cookies and cream and I'm really excited about this one because it has Oreo cookies with it so that's one of the things that we really enjoy here is Oreo cookies actually we just enjoy chocolate I think so anyway there's gonna be a couple of different mixes for this that's going to have to be put together and the first one is consists of a block of softened cream cheese a teaspoon of vanilla and a quarter cup of sugar and one egg so we're gonna go ahead and get that together get started on it and back with you to finish this this is the texture you'll run it right here good for spreading we have male beat the second part of the second set of ingredients together we have beat together the butter sugar and cocoa and this large bowl along with the eggs and vanilla so the next thing we're going to do is want to add our flour and baking powder and we will gradually add this to the cocoa and stir in the crushed cookie crumbs and we'll be back with that finished part the next step is to stir our Oreos that we've crushed crushed 12 oven throw them right into this mix remember the first mix we had had cream cheese in it we've got it set to the side we're getting there feeling I hear four brownies together [Music] I think that's about getting this just to be sure we got sides all right the next thing we want to do pour that into her Pam this is a seven instructions are asked for a greased pan so I'm gonna freeze my pants we're going my favorite I don't greet with my kids right here and that kind of that around real good that's a lot better next time the brand-new mixture I remember this is my first time on this one too so I've got fixed to cookie and cream brandy but we're going to when we get down with airs I was just about becchi that you want to fix you one too just from the smell of this right now I know that this is gonna be really really good all right the next step if we want to spend our cream cheese mixture over the batter we do it like that but I will have to spread it some I'm sure that this is the top they mixed in so we cut it on top here and then kind of spray well if I had all those offset I'm like keeping one of those there's obvious that spatulas they were so good for stuff like this but I don't not today anyway that's just how it is sometimes and I don't think it's really gonna matter if you get just a little touch of that chocolate in there like that so this is one big temper with Oreos in any way we want to crumble up eight more Oreos and crumble over the top of this [Music] and here we go God gave us your hands for that was seven right supposed to be a total I think I'm smooth another one in there don't you I'd be a couple pieces there and here and here but anyway we're gonna put this in the oven at 350 degrees bake for about 25 to 30 minutes and then we'll tested that I'll test it up about 20 minutes with the toothpicks if it comes drying out of the center and then we'll examine the finished product this is our finished product we left it in the oven about 30 minutes we checked it at 25 it was still in the center we check in at 30 and it was still loose in the center wasn't firm yet so we put the aluminum foil over because it was starting to brown around the edges and we didn't really want it to to continue to do that throughout the entire brownie we wanted the center to stay the way it is with the cream cheese look in it just we just like that look and and it is going to end up with a good texture but overall I was Pro about 40 minutes so we're gonna let this go real good and slice it up and we'll be back with you in a little bit and let you know how it tastes here's the finished product and we've already been in it I wasn't supposed to tell you but our son came down and got him a little bit of it for him and his girlfriend she's in this season so I'm telling you I've tried it already and that is just it's got a good texture to it and it tastes so good so enjoy now I'm going to post the recipe to this on our website it's kind of a long recipe it's not difficult at all it's just got several ingredients in it very easy to pick free easy to put

cup of cocoa powder four eggs 6 ounces of Hershey's cookies and cream chocolate bar one tablespoon of vanilla extract two sticks of butter and 12 Oreos I'm just starting off with two sticks of butter and you either want it to be melted or softened now I'm just going to pour it into a bowl then you're going to want to add in one cup of cocoa powder when everything is mixed together I'm going to add in two cups of sugar and mix that together as well now I just have four eggs and I'm just going to mix them in one at a time if you want to you can add in a little bit of vanilla extract now you're just going to want to add in one and a half cups of flour and I only added in one because they were the recipe wrong but just make sure to add in one and a half cups and it will come out perfect next I'm just going to pour in this whole jar of hot fudge and mix it together now I just have 12 Oreos and I'm just going to use my fingers to break it into little pieces with the Hershey's cookies and cream chocolate bar again I'm just going to use my fingers to break it up into little pieces when everything is crushed up I'm just going to add the Oreos and the chocolate bar and just mix everything together when everything is mixed together I just have a 9 by 13 inch pan with aluminum foil and some nonstick spray and I'm just going to pour it into the pan and then spread it out after 30 minutes it didn't seem muddy so I cooked it for another 15 minutes when I took it out of the pan that I just started coming apart because it was too hot or wasn't ready yet so I flipped over the pan and let it cool so that the pan would form the right shape and it came out perfectly fine for the frosting you're going to need half a cup of light cream two sticks of butter three teaspoons of vanilla extract four cups of powdered sugar and ten Oreos or the frosting you're going to need some softened butter and I'm just going to add that into the stand mixer and I'm also just going to add in a little bit of vanilla extract and just cream that together now I have 1 cup of powdered sugar and I'm just going to add that in a little at a time next I'm going to add in 1 cup of light cream and you're going on mix that together until it's all light and fluffy then I just have some more crushed Oreos and I'm just going to carefully fold that in and then your frosting is done now I'm just taking a little bit of that frosting and spreading it on top of the brownies as evenly as I can and I think that the frosting was like they're made too much so I would suggest only making half this recipe because it was just way too much for me at least and then you're just going to want to cut this into little slices and this actually makes a lot it would be great for a party or something like that and I thought it was like way too sweet overall but my friends really loved it so anyways thank you guys so much for watching and I will see you guys next time bye", "TzPz5lHRh0s": "hi mysu people today's video is actually on this white chocolate chip cookies and cream brownies if you wanna know how i make it then do keep on watching [Music] you'll need items like flour oreos condensed milk butter egg salt and white chocolate chips so just prepare a mixing bowl and add in your butter i'm using unsalted butter here sometimes i like to switch it up so if i'm using salted then i'll remove the salt together so next you can add in your white chocolate chips like how you do normal brownies is the same thing so instead of the dark chocolate cheese you're actually using white chocolate so you just need to microwave for around 30 seconds and make sure that your white this batter doesn't burn because of the chocolate and then just continue mixing until both the butter and the white chocolate are actually well mixed after this is done then you can take another mixing bowl and you can add in the egg and next you can add in your condensed milk so over here i'm actually using the condensed milk which this recipe actually called for the whole can and i didn't think that i wanted to be so sweet so actually lessen this and i only added around three quarters of the can itself so if you want you can just add in the whole can up to you but um it actually ended up being sweet but i mean not as sweet as a brownie would i guess so i actually just wanted to put in lesser because i was afraid that it would be too sweet as you know normal brownies are sweet but that is dark chocolate so this being white chocolate i didn't want it to be overly sweet and it turned out just fine so it just based on your preference on what you actually want so next you can add in the white chocolate batter into this mixing bowl and just mix well [Music] [Music] there must be something bad [Music] [Music] after these two are well combined next you can sift your flour so i'm using all purpose flour here and then just sieve the flour and add into your batter and then you can just continue mixing until everything is fully combined [Music] she's a mona lisa [Music] you'll find her beauty goes much deeper once you get to meet her she's a mona lisa [Music] i'm adding the flour in batches so that it's not too much in one go which is better because if not it will be a bit hard to mix and then everything will be flying everywhere so just adding it slowly and just mixing as i mix it now it's actually getting a bit tougher so the batter is becoming like a thick consistency and i was a bit afraid at this point because i was like it's too thick now so is this going to come out as you know as i expect or not but yeah it did turn out good and then next you can add in your vanilla extract or essence and just continue mixing [Music] i'm not sure if i actually recorded that i added um salt but just remember to add in your salt as well so that you don't forget and next you can crush up nine oreos or more if you want and then just add it into your batter and you can crush it as finely as you want or bigger pieces up to you so i'm not really crushing it that much for the eight of the oreos only for one of the oreos i actually crushed it more finely but it still turned out to look uh the batter was still quite um light like you know like a cookies and cream kind of um feeling you'll find the beauty goes much deeper once you get to meet her she's a [Music] monalisa [Music] i [Music] [Music] all the [Music] just hold me down like that [Music] [Music] now that you're done with mixing everything and it's all um well combined so you can get your pen and i'm using an eight times eight inch here so you can get a baking paper and grease it so they can add your batter into the pan and then prepare to bake the brownies [Music] and all the girls [Music] [Music] [Music] the weather actually looks really good and looks like ice cream actually but of course don't eat it and then um just bake it at 350 fahrenheit and you can bake for around 30 to 35 minutes [Music] you [Music] once it's done baking then you can allow it to cool and you can slice to serve but this was really an interesting recipe to make and the brownies actually this brownies actually didn't really um taste like or is you know the the consistency and the end product actually turned out to be something like a cake i feel it's more like a cake than a brownie but of course this is a brownie recipe and it did turn out nice and interesting actually i never really had white chocolate brownies so this is the cookies and cream brownie recipe hope you guys liked it if you liked it um don't forget to like the video and subscribe if you haven't so see you guys in my next video thank you so much for watching bye guys [Music] she likes chocolate covered strawberries and wine she likes knows that say i love you all the time roses at your feet baby", "cW3w1br9Crw": "good morning centennial today blue's bistro we're going to learn how to make cookie and cream brownies [Music] so first we're going to take our butter and our chocolate and we're going to be melting it in the microwave at 20 to 30 second intervals you always have to be very careful when you're melting chocolate in the microwave because if you heat it too quickly at a too high temperature you will burn the chocolate so after you've done that and it's coming together and it's all melted you're gonna go ahead and put that in your stand mixer or use your hand mixer or you can also do this by hand [Music] then you're going to add in your sugar and using the flat head attachment you're going to mix the two together after they have combined together you're going to go ahead and add in the rest of your wet ingredients which is going to be the eggs and the vanilla [Music] after all our wet ingredients have come together it's time to add in our dry ingredients you're going to sift together the cocoa powder the flour and the salt and once that's all been sieved you're going to go ahead and add that into your mix and you're going to let it come together finally you're gonna add in the two cups of chopped oreos i'm gonna give that a quick mix don't mix it too much because you don't want to smash the oreos too badly they've already been crushed once they have all been mixed in it's ready to move over to the pan you're going to take your batter and put it in a 13 by 9 pan you can either grease the pan or you can put parchment paper on the pan after it's in the pan you're going to put it in the oven that's been preheated to 350 degrees and the brownies are going to bake for 25 to 30 minutes you want to bake them until you can stick a toothpick in the center and the toothpick comes out clean while the brownies are baking you can go ahead and start to make the topping you want to make it right when the brownies are about to come out so it doesn't set up in the bowl you want to set up on top of the brownies you're going to take your chocolate chips and your heavy cream and you're going to melt them in the microwave once again at 20 to 30 second intervals you don't want to melt too quickly at too high a temperature because once again you'll burn your chocolate after it's been all melted together you're going to go ahead and add in the powdered sugar and the rest of those oreos and you're going to let it set it to the side once your brownies have come out and they have cooled not that not to be cool completely but once they've cooled for about 10 minutes or so you can go ahead and put this on top and then you're going to want to let the brownies set for about an hour so that the top can come together and it's going to create this nice creamy cookie cream layer on top of your brownies once the brownies have cool and set up feel free to cut them up and enjoy i hope you guys and your families are staying safe and i'll see you next time you", "O-rO3ZEq4oU": "how to make cookies and cream brownies hello everyone I found this recipe in taste of home magazines fall baking issue and I found it at the grocery store checkout line so starting off with 8 ounces of cream cheese and a half a teaspoon of vanilla extract add to that 1/4 cup of white granulated sugar and 1 egg beat those things together until you get a nice and smooth and creamy mixture and then set that aside you need to crush 12 Oreo cookies until you get some finer crumbs and I just put mine in a ziplock bag and I used a rolling pin now onto the brownies in a large bowl place 1/2 a cup of butter melted 1/2 cup of brown sugar packed 1/2 cup of white granulated sugar 1/2 cup of unsweetened cocoa and blend those things together until combined then you're going to blend in two large eggs recipe doesn't specify one at a time so I put them in all at once and I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract I blended that until smooth and then I added in a teaspoon of baking powder and 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour now you can certainly blend the flour and the baking powder together prior to adding it to the brownie batter but I don't think it makes that big of a difference once the flours blend it in add in those crushed Oreos and stir it in with a spoon once the crumbs are nicely stirred in you're going to spread the batter into the bottom of a 9 by 13 inch baking dish that's been greased I lined mine with aluminum foil and then greased the aluminum foil spread the brownie layer out and then on top of that spread the cream cheese layer spread it out so it's nice and even and then you're going to coarsely chop up an additional 8 Oreo cookies and then sprinkle them over the top now you're going to bake this at 350 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes up with moist crumbs attached let them cool and then cut them into squares

Phi Island - yum yum yeah okay -  let's go now you want sauce and brownie okay", "hEOqrLxMLaY": "this podcast is produced by the Harwood productions podcast network to learn more about the network and to find more of our shows visit us online at WWE would podcast com hi I'm Cindy Harris in this episode I'm going to share with you my cookies and cream brownies I've taken a really fuzzy brownie mixed in some crushed Oreo cookies and then topped it with a really great cream cheese topping that I've marbled together now whenever I'm making brownies I like to put a parchment sleeve in the pan it helps to get the brownies out so let me show you how I do that for this recipe I'm using a nine by nine inch square pan I'm going to give it a little spritz with some baking spray then I have a piece of parchment that I've cut it's about the width of the pan I'm going to place it in their kind of bend the edges over just a little bit and then just give one last little spritz now we're going to make our cream cheese layer for these brownies and I'm going to use 8 ounces of cream cheese now I'm here in the States we have what's called Philadelphia Cream Cheese and Anna in Portugal was telling me that there they just call it Philadelphia I'm you could also substitute marscapone a cheese if that's all you can find but you do want to start with 8 ounces and I'm going to put this in a small bowl to that I'm going to add a quarter of a cup of sugar 1 egg and a half a teaspoon of vanilla extract now if you can't find vanilla extract in your country and you can find vanilla beans what you would do is take half of a vanilla vanilla bean and scrape the seeds out and put that in here the ratio is if I say 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract you could use one whole vanilla bean but for this i'm using just a half a teaspoon so then you just use a half of a vanilla bean now normally I use my kitchen aid for everything but because this is a small amount i'm going to use my hand mixer and i'm going to start it on a low speed and I'm going to mix this cream cheese mixture together till it's nice and smooth now this mixture is pretty smooth so I'm going to go ahead and just set this to the side now we're going to start with the chocolate part of our brownies now to do that for the cookies and cream part these are the cookies that's the cream so what I'm going to use our 12 what we call Oreo cookies Oreos are a chocolate sandwich cookie and I know they're called all kinds of different things in other places but this is the kind of cookie that you want to use for this brownie now I need to take 12 of these cookies I'm putting them in a little resealable bag here and I need to crush these up so what I'm going to do is I'm going to seal this except for about the last inch or so that way a little bit of air can come come out and I'm going to take my rolling pin and i'm just going to mash these up now once the cookies start to get pretty well mash then i'm actually going to use the rolling pin as it's made to be used and i'm going to grind these up even finer now another thing that's great about these brownies is we don't need to use the mixer for this particle the rest of it can be made just in a bowl i'm going to take my cookie crumbs put them right in here then I'm going to add half a cup of melted butter a half a cup of sugar half a cup of packed brown sugar and a half a cup of cocoa powder I'm going to mix these together with my spatula now at this point it's going to look very kind of dry like this which is ok but I do want to make sure that I get that brown sugar and those cookie crumbs mixed in with our other ingredients it's going to almost look like wet sand at this point now I'm going to add two eggs and I want to take a moment and mix those in really well now I'm going to add my flour I'm just using all-purpose flour I'm going to dip my measuring cup in level it with my knife and add one half of a cup to my bowl now we want just a little bit of lift in these brownies I'm going to add one teaspoon of baking powder now we're going to mix the flour and baking powder in you can see this is very fudgy which means very yummy but i do want to take the time at this point make sure i get those pockets of flour up and you can see right in here where i have won it they show up really easily with this dark chocolate batter but do make sure to get that all mixed in and then one last ingredient a teaspoon of vanilla and we'll mix that in now I'm going to take my super thick and super delicious if you haven't tried a taste of it now do its brownies but then you have those crushed up cookie crumbs in it it's really good I'm going to take this then I'm going to pour it all into my pan that I prepared now you can see this brownie batter is so thick that it doesn't move so I need to take my spatula and I need to move that batter all the way to all four corners to every side of this pan this is really important we want a solid layer of this brownie mixture now I'm going to take my cream cheese and I'm going to spoon that on top of the brownie now I'm going to use my little spatula here and I'm going to spread this out just like I did the brownies because what we're going to do now is I'm just going to take a regular dinner knife and I'm going to take it and I'm going to have the blade flat like this and I'm just going to kind of marble this brownie and the cream cheese together now what you're seeing here is a little bit of the chocolate and a little bit of the cream getting mixed together just like this now what's great about this technique is it doesn't look like much from up top but when you cut into it it's going to have all these streaks of chocolate and cream be really good now what's going to happen in the oven is that brownie mixture the brownie and cookie is going to kind of puff up and kind of envelop that cream cheese mixture and that takes about 25 minutes in the oven now look at how great these rows and the marbling is not great but we do want to take a toothpick and pop it in the center now this came out nice and clear today this ended up taking about 35 minutes so don't be surprised if it takes you know maybe anywhere between 25 to 35 minutes one of the things I look for is do you see back here this is actually starting to pull away from the side of the pan I always look for that when I'm making bar cookies or brownies because that tells me that they are cooked all the way through but I always like to double check by using the toothpick now I'm going to need to leave these brownies on the cooling rack in the pan and these are going to need to cool for at least one hour so now I'm going to take the brownies out of the pan so I'm going to use my little dinner knife again and I'm going to run it just along the two edges where there's no parchment and I'm going to lift it off the cooling rack and I'm going to grab onto the sleeves here and I'm just going to very carefully pop that right out onto the cooling rack and you can see look nothing in the pan just great now I'm going to let me sit on the cooling rack for a few more minutes and we can cut them up now I want to show you I've taken a square out of the brownies and it's such a fudgy brownie with that great cream-cheese topping this really is a good cookies and cream brownie now because these brownies have our cream cheese in them they'll need to be refrigerated now there's a couple of ways you can do that you can go ahead and cut them up and then wrap them individually and put them in the refrigerator you can put this back in the pan and cover it with plastic or foil and put it in the refrigerator and also if you wanted to freeze these what you could do is again cut them up in whatever shapes you want wrap them in plastic and then put them in the freezer I know that these are great frozen and if you wanted to have one defrosted then you could just take it out for about 10 or 15 minutes and then have it

have the recipe there for you and as always if you have any questions please feel free to send me an email I'll see you next time", "i_8L-wDH3NI": "Hi guys, I'm Laura Vitale. On this episode of Laura in the Kitchen, it\nhas dawned on me, in about a minute now, that I have not made a brownie recipe in a while,\nand I don't know about you but I find that to be unacceptable! Who am I? Where have I been? What's been happening? I'm over the cauliflower, I'm over the low\ncarb, I want sugar, and I want chocolate and I want it in brownie form. But in particular, I want a cookies and cream\ncheesecake brownie that's going to rock my world, and yours too. So that's what we're going to make today,\nit's easy and simple, obviously, I feel like that's something that I shouldn't have to\nsay anymore because you know that if it's not easy or simple, I ain't doing it. So, let's get started, like I said a cookies\nand cream, Oreo, whatever you want to call it cheesecake brownie. So good, you're gonna love it! Let's run through the ingredients, I'm a little\nbit all over the place, but you know what, it's fine. For the cheesecake situation, you need your\ncream cheese. By the way, don't look at my nails, my daughter\npainted them with a little nail kit that she got for her birthday so I'm going to leave\nthem even though they make no sense. Cream cheese, egg, a little sugar, vanilla\nand some crushed Oreos. Now, the world is your pickle, boo, you do\nyou. You don't like Oreos? Use a different cookie. Use whatever you want. Because that's what cooking is all about,\nI like Oreo cookies but hey, you can do whatever you want. So let's work on the cheesecake situation,\nshall we? With the cream cheese I'm going to add a splash\nof vanilla - good vanilla with all those beans, see that? That is flavor! Your egg. And some sugar. And now Baby Bash Style - you know this if\nyou were a teen in the early 2000s, you're going to cream this until it's oh so fine. So, I'm going to use my handheld electric\nwhisk and I'll show you what it looks like when it is there because it is going to be\nloud. Beautiful. Now, I don't know why I did that I'm going\nto need those. Anyway, fold in your cookies. And this is your cookies and cream cheesecake\nperfection layer. Okay. Now, I've got my oven preheated to 350F. I have an 8 by 8 inch pan ready to go lined\nwith parchment paper and sprayed well with some spray, some baking spray, you can use\nbutter, whatever your heart desires. Switching gears to a large bowl with some\nunsalted butter that has been softened at room temperature. o it we are going to add eggs and w're going\nto cream this together until it's combined. What I'm also going to do is - which you won't\nsee - is I'm going to take chocolate chips, pip them in the microwave, melt them until\nlovely, melted and delicious, and I'm going to do all of that and meet you back here and\nwe'll proceed. I'm very excited. Whenever there is sugar involved, which you\nguys know I don't eat until the weekend, I get very excited because it's time for a treat. Life is about balance, but you know the weekend,\nI'm going to have a glass of wine, I'm going to have some sugar, most likely some pasta,\nmaybe even some fried chicken. The point is, I get very excited when it comes\nto some treats that I know I'm going to get to enjoy with loved ones. Okay, I'm going to cream this together and\nI'm going to pop this in. Going to add my eggs, I'm going to make sure\nthat it - somebody - thank you. I'm going to make sure that they're all combined\n- hey! Oh my plug is unplugged. I'm going to plug my thing in, finish whisking\nthis and then we'll add in the chocolate. Add your chocolate, mostly molten - mostly\nfully melted but there's still a few chunks, but you know what, the residual heat will\ncontinue to melt that, and I'm just going to mix it all in. Then we add in the next thing, and then we\ndo this and then we you know - but it's easy. Chocolate mixture is done, my dry ingredients\nwhich I'm just going to quickly mix with my spoon - you know I didn't sift my cocoa powder,\nbut don't tell anybody. And you know why I didn't do it? I could tell you that I forgot. What's the fun in that? I just didn't feel like it. And do you want to know why? Because washing a sieve is my least favorite\nthing in the world to do, and the dishwasher doesn't do the best job at it so a lump of\nchocolate here or there is fine, it's fine really. Just blend that in, I'm just going to combine\nit with my spatula because it's easier, because it starts to thicken and it gets just a little\nbit too hard to do with my whisk anyway, so. Took about half of my brownie batter, more\nlike a dough really, and you just sort of smear it in an even layer in the bottom of\nyour situation, of your 8 by 8. Then you take this delight, your cheesecake\nfilling, and you throw all of that right in the middle. You know this is going to be out of this world. I mean you know it, you sense it, you feel\nit you understand it, and you're on board with this. Okay, now you take the remainder of your brownie\nbatter, and because it's so thick it's much easier to take small dollops and throw that\non there, and I don't really worry about flattening it out or anything because some of that cheesecake\nis going to peek through anyway, so it all evens out in the oven and it's fine, and I\njust take little dollops like this and just pop that on for now. Once you've got the leftover batter on top,\nI just take the back of my spoon and you just sort of smear it, like I said some of your\ncheesecake filling is going to peek through, but you're not trying to cover the whole thing,\nyou're trying to almost sandwich together that cheesecake filling as much as you can. This is going to go in your preheated oven\nat 350F for about 30 to 35 minutes or until the brownies are pretty set, then they're\ngoing to cool and then we slice and we eat. That's it! So my brownies were in the oven for 35 minutes\nand as you can see, the batter as it cooks, sort of evens out on top, and it's just perfection,\nI have let these cool for a couple of hours, you want to make sure that these are at room\ntemperature before you cut them. The smell is so perfection, there are no words,\nand just you wait until you see this! Look at the delicious, gooey, incredible. I can't handle this, they're not dry, cakey\nbrownies, these are deliciously fudgy, you know why I'm cutting this because if you've\nmet me and we've known each other a long time then you know what I'm going after. No thanks! Yes Please! Look at that! My mouth is watering, it's gooey, it's so\nincredible you have absolutely no idea. And. It just goes down like cold water on a hot\nday. It is a marriage made in food heaven by the\nfood gods who love food. It's what dreams are made of. I have no words other than go to LauraintheKitchen.com,\njust do it. I know it's rich, I know it's over the top,\nbut if you're going to treat yourself on the weekend, you might as well do it all the way. The recipe is there. I have no words, see you next time, I can't\neven talk.

so I went around and I found a job I was ironing so I could make money to buy brownies you would iron to make yeah I am I wasn't very good at it I was like a dollar an hour I used to get oh no no you took it to a whole other level when you actually started to make them as well to put your own spin on them yeah I did so I was modeling loved it but you know I lived in New York I was having a fabulous time but I just thought you know what I really want to do something else I want to get on another career path and so I discovered baking I did lots of jobs in between to find out what I

started okay so in here I have three eggs and two egg yolks and sugar onion whisk it like mad okay now if everybody can take out they'll look at that she will but it's nice and fluffy I was like a meringue or as Abba yah yeah yeah exactly so you have to do this for how many minutes to get it nice and week you're doing it with this tell me about 20 minutes yeah no we didn't do that don't use an electric with I have to stop what story you know what's the PSI on the front tire of a Corvette thank you yeah all right no I mean about the beer I don't know all right look so it's like so step now why do you have no this is just eggs egg yolk and sugar so far like I saw she mixed it up for two or three minutes to get the get voluminous and why do you have to make it there's no raising agent in this no no wait so you need to whisk it to get lots of air in it so it doesn't rise loads in the oven but it's important that it does get some air in it so in goes this malted chocolate and butter you have to my job oh my goodness so hot what you have to take your shirt off on the show you can you read it still die now we have some flour I don't know all-purpose that looks chocolaty to me with cocoa powder okay and then just sprinkle it on like that so there's not a lot of flour in this no why why do you put the flour flour just gives it some structure to keep it holding together otherwise

brownie no pan cookies sponge brownie let's read their ridiculous overwrought description on the back our fudge brownie will astonish even the most die-hard chocolate lover spoil yourself with this sinful blend of silky rich chocolate our brownies are deliciously dense with a moist intensely chocolaty interior somewhere between a chocolate truffle and a piece of fudge this confection will lead you into temptation and satisfy your chocolate fix we shall see about all that I don't know why these things so difficult to open but I'm looking for - so MILF and cookies we've reviewed a couple of their products in the past including I believe a chocolate chip cookie there's and a different brownie - slave right I found them to be all sort of middle-of-the-road edibles about average and I'm looking forward to try this brownie seeing how it fares with all the other brownies we have done thus far 250 milligrams is about normal for me in terms of potency oh it is a very very very falling apart brownie oh boy so it's incredibly crumbly a lot of the brownie feels like it's lost huh well let me show you guys so the packaging has left my brownie very crumbly which is kind of disappointing when you pay for it you know that's that's some money that's some product right there I'll take it up by crumbles anyway it doesn't matter all right let's give it a taste let's ignore those crumbs mmm I would describe it someone between a chocolate chocolate truffle and a piece of fudge no I wouldn't I would just grab his a shitty brownie um no we don't very little we'd taste but it's not a very good brownie it's it is fudgy er like they say not gonna confuse you for a chocolate truffle that's for sure but it's not bad it's small although I again must take on some point software it's very um crumbly nature there's again that is a significant part of your edible that has been reduced to crumbs okay well I'm gonna polish this bad boy off and as we all know it's not about how it tastes but rather about how it makes you feel so like with all our wheats reviews I will be back in two hours to let you guys know how this fudge brownie is making me feel thank you so much for watching weeks guys and we'll see you very soon bye welcome back to wheats we're talking MILF and cookies MILF and cookies brownie yes guys we're talking the 250 milligrams fudge milk-and-cookies brownie I didn't really like how it tasted I didn't really like how it all was crumbly and fell apart and hard to know if you're getting all your brownie or not even but I do I like how it makes me feel I gotta say I'm pretty pretty high um for a 250 milligram animal this seems to be on the upper end of that and it's a pretty affordable I think it cost me seven dollars maybe eight dollars I can't remember exactly seven or eight dollars so yeah pretty affordable doesn't taste great actually tastes pretty bad and it does have some problems when it comes to being too crumbly and falling apart in the package but still it got me pretty pretty faded so if you see the in open cookies bunch barely 250 milligrams at a dispensary near you wheat says go ahead and make that bad boy up you're not gonna be disappointed and with that thank you so much for watching wheat skies and we will check you out on the next review hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please

we are still shut for now we're hoping to open one of these weeks very soon so you guys can come on down and say hi to us and try some delicious cakes and cookies but until then we're keeping the doors shut so i thought why not come and bake a recipe for you guys here and today i'm gonna bake one of your favorite and one of our favorite treats ever and it is a cookie dough oreo brownie and that's exactly what it is it is a layer of oreos that is sandwiched between cookie and brownie and it is absolutely delicious so the first thing we need to do is get our tin ready so we need to line this with some greaseproof paper like so and i'm just going to do that with some cake spray here because i'm in soho and we got all the stuff but at home you can just do it with a little bit of butter or some oil [Music] it's really important to line your tin especially with something like a brownie because you need to get it out and it's gonna be really hard to get out of this tin unless you've lined it and you'll see we can just very easily pick it out using the baking paper so let's get on with making the first layer which is the cookie layer and it's very very simple what we're gonna do is put all our ingredients here and mix it together starting with some plain flour and we're going to add in some light brown sugar some sea salt and some soft unsalted butter and one whole egg as well as an extra egg yolk and we're just going to mix this together until it's one smooth consistent dough and finally we're going to add some chocolate chips now i'm adding these at the end because if you put them in at the beginning with everything else and you whisk it for quite a long time the chocolate can melt and end up with a chocolate dough rather than a chocolate chip dough so i'm going to put all of those in and mix them through [Music] and once they've evenly spread through the batter we can get this into the tin so just bung it all in [Music] so you just want to spread this out so it's nice and even and one level i find it easiest to do that with the little offset palette knife as you know it's my favorite tool i'll use it whenever and wherever i can and if not though you could just push this down with your fingers or with the back of a spoon until it's lovely and flat now we need to get this in the oven for 15 minutes and that's not going to cook it completely it's just going to get it started so that when we put the brownie on top we'll have a little bit of a crispy cookie and a gooey brownie so this is going to go in for 15 minutes at 170 degrees c [Music] [Applause] okay so cookie has had 15 minutes it's got a little bit of a crust on top but not like fully baked because don't forget it's going to go back in the oven once it's got the brownie on top which we're going to get on with making now so we're going to start with some chocolate and some unsalted butter and we're going to put those in the microwave or you can do it over memory we just want to melt them until they're lovely and smooth and combined that's amazing so we will just leave that to cool down doesn't need to be completely cold when we use it but just to take the heat off it and we'll get on with whisking together some caster sugar with one egg [Music] so i had that whisking for about four to five minutes and you can see how pale it is and it's also gone really thick and fluffy so that's really important you don't want to just mix together the sugar and the egg you want to give it time to beat up and incorporate loads of air it's really going to add to the texture of your brownie so now we're going to fold through our delicious chocolatey buttery mixture and as always when you're folding just be nice and gentle cutting it through the middle and scraping it up from the bottom it takes a little bit of time but it's really important because it means you're not going to knock out any of the air that we just created by whisking our eggs and once it's all lovely and smooth and looking like one color we can go in with our final ingredients which is some plain flour some cocoa powder some baking powder just to give it a little bit of lift and some salt to pull out our chocolaty flavors and again we're going to fold that through until it's fully combined [Music] and when you're there you'll end up with this delicious thick gooey brownie mixture now we can grab back our cookie so be careful because it might still be a little bit hot so get your oven gloves out and before we put our brownie on top we obviously need to put our oreos in so just cover your cookie layer with the oreos and last but not least it's time to pour on our yummy gooey brownie [Music] and then we need to spread that out to cover the oreos and make it lovely and level on top so and now it's back in the oven for 20 minutes if you want it gooey like i do and how i think you should eat your brownie but if you prefer it a little bit more cooked a bit more cakey then go for 25. all right guys the brownie has come out the oven and it's cooled down completely so we can get this out of the tin now don't try and get a brownie out of a tin when it's warm because it will just be so hard and it will crumble and it'll be such a shame i'm going to show you how to lift this out with the baking parchment so just release it a little bit by pulling at the corners and you can see the brownie is lifting up and then we just need to hopefully it'll all come out in one big piece look at that now it looks kind of cool with the cookie and the brownie but let's cut it inside because that's the best bit it looks so good and i've just cut myself like the biggest pizza brownie ever um which is fine but look look at the gooey kind of cookie here oh it's still kind of melted and then you've got the oreo in there and the gooey brownie shall i just bite into this yeah okay [Music] oh man that is so so good i mean there's not a lot that's better than a brownie but whack on some oreos

quantities as i'm going through them don't panic i will pop all the details all the quantities in the link below to my blog and you can find everything there so we'll give that a quick mix just to completely combine the sugars with your butter and i should have said whilst i am making my brownie batter i have turned my oven on so it is preheating at 170 degrees just while i put this all together so we're just giving it a very quick mix just to combine it so that it's all one mixture to that i'm going to add three eggs and i add them in one at a time and mix in between each addition just to make sure that it's completely combined in i love making brownies they are so quick and easy and they are so adaptable to different flavors that you like and things like that so this is just a very quick and easy bake brilliant for things like lunch boxes or if you want a quick bite to eat with a cup of tea or anything like that or even a quick dessert midweek egg number two and my last egg so now that's all mixed time for my dry ingredients i'm going to sift them in because i always like to make sure there's no lumps so i've got self-raising flour here this is a hundred grams of self-raising flour and i'm going to add 50 grams of cocoa powder and sift it all in there we go all sifted in let's give that a very quick mix and that is our brownie mixture then done and once it has all come together you will have this beautiful thick brownie mixture so that is it done now it's time to have a little clear and to pop it in our pan now what i'm going to do actually is i'm not going to put all of my mixture in i'm going to put just over half of it in first and the reason i'm doing that this time is because i want to then line the middle of my brownie mixture with some oreos so once you have lined the bottom of it and you've made sure you've completely covered the base of your pan with your brownie mix it's time for some oreos so i've got a lovely bowl here this is about 20 oreos i'm going to use 16 of these to line my pan i'm just going to push them four in a row across and giving them a little squish in as i put them in as well and then four down once you have put them in just give them a very gentle push down just to get them into your brownie mixture because we're going to use the rest to cover the top of them so it makes it a little bit easier so i'm just going to tip the rest in and just spread it out very gently across the top of all my oreos and if you're a fan of brownies like me don't forget to check out my other brownies i've got the most amazing biscoff brownies recipe check out the link above but if you're a fan of oreos do check out my cookies and cream fudge that one is to die for and once you have pushed all your mixture over your br your oreos sorry it should be completely smooth on top or smooth as you can get it and now it's time for some extra oreos i've just got a few spare and i'm just going to break them up into chunks rough chunks and just dot them across the top of my brownies just give them a little push in just to help them get into the mixture and become a part of it don't forget if you've enjoyed this video to like it and do subscribe as well so you find out every time i release a new one and once you have put all your bits off um cookie in there it's time to bake so i'm going to pop this in my preheated oven it's going to take 25 to 30 minutes to bake and i will see you on the other side with baked brownies right welcome back my brownies are out of the oven i left them to cool completely in the tin before i cut them just to make sure that they held their shape really well when you make a brownie you need to look for the outside to be quite firm but the middle if you put anything into it might still be a little bit gooey it'll have a lovely shiny crust and that's what you're looking for and that gives you this beautiful soft squidgy middle that brownies are so well known for so once they were done i cut them up in 16 pieces that's how many i get out of my brownies you can obviously cut them bigger or smaller depending on what you want and they are good to go so i hope you've enjoyed this video

recipe we're making Oreo Brownie Blondie Bars\nlike I said they're super easy to make they're absolutely delicious you're\ngonna love them let's do this First let's prepare a 9 by 13 inch pan\nby spraying with oil or greasing with butter and lining with parchment paper\nset that aside and let's make the brownie batter\nplace butter and chocolate chips or chopped chocolate in a bowl and melt it\non the microwave by microwaving for 30 second intervals and whisking in between\nuntil the mixture is smooth and melted now we're going to add some granulated\nsugar and some brown sugar and whisk until incorporated once incorporated we're going to add\neggs. Add one egg at a time and whisk until incorporated before adding the\nnext egg and along with the last egg we're also\ngoing to add some vanilla extract whisk until the egg is completely incorporated now we're going to sift some all-purpose flour, cocoa powder\nand salt into the wet batter and then mix the batter with a whisk\nuntil the mixture is smooth and incorporated now we're going to add some chocolate\nchips and stir to combine and now we're going to set the brownie\nbatter aside and we're going to make the blondie batter to make the blondie batter we're also\ngoing to start by melting butter place it in the microwave and microwave\nfor 15 seconds until the butter is completely melted next add some granulated sugar and some brown sugar and whisk until incorporated and then we're also going to add eggs and whisk one at a time before adding\nthe next egg then add vanilla and I'm also going to\nadd a little bit of almond extract you can skip the almond extract but I really\nlike the taste it gives to the blondies then we're going to add some flour and\nwhisk until combined once the batter is nice and smooth we're\ngoing to add some white chocolate chips so now here comes the fun part we're\ngoing to assemble the bars first we're going to spread half of the\nbrownie batter on the bottom of the prepared pan and then we're going to lay out some\nOreo cookies on top and now we're going to spread the blondie\nbatter on top of the Oreos and then lay out some golden Oreos on\ntop of the blondie batter and then finally spread the other half\nof the brownie batter on top of the golden Oreos it's gonna seem that it's a very thin\nlayer of brownie but that's okay because once it bakes it\ngets thick in the oven now we're just going to spread out some\nchopped Oreos on top of the brownies and then we're going to bake on the\npreheated 350 fahrenheit oven for about 50 minutes and then I'm topping the hot brownies with some\nwhite chocolate chips and some dark chocolate chunks since the brownies are hot the chocolate is going to stick to the top of the\nbrownies after the brownie is cooled down it's time\nto slice I hope you enjoyed today's recipe this\nbrownies are super indulgent they're one of the most delicious things\nI've ever made you're gonna want to make this\nfor more recipes like this subscribe to my channel I post videos\nevery week and check out the full recipe on my blog\nthanks for watching bye", "n4Ijp9zW37o": "[Applause] [Music] [Applause] slum guys and welcome back I'm back with another food video because of your demand today I'm making something so delicious you're gonna want to try it yourself okay I'm making the five layer brownie cookie cheesecake it consists of chocolate chip cookies Oreos cheesecake then another layer of Oreos and then brownie at the bottom it's kind of weird don't get me wrong I absolutely love all of these desserts on their own but I'm a little skeptical about how it's gonna taste all together is it gonna be - cheesy - chocolaty or - sweet all of this dessert talk is getting me hungry let's go bake okay so first step is to line a 10 inch pan of saran wrap and I'm gonna take two cups and as a chocolate chip dough I've actually made this dough in my previous cookie videos so if you guys are interested you can check that out I'll have it linked in the I will be easier if I like break it up so I'm pressing the dough in it to the bottom of the pen it's even now I'm going to fold in the disc stick wrap I'm gonna piece this next up I'm gonna be making the brownie just in case there's some shelter I don't want it to fall my batter I love the smell of brownies oh my gosh especially when they're baking now that my brownie mix is well combined I'm gonna pour it into my pad so make sure you will coat the pan as well as the small pan so the recipe actually asked for eight inches I don't have an eight inch pan the closest to an eight inch I have in the 7 inch sole the borders might be a little thick with brownies which I'm a mad about I don't mind a thick brownie I pour the batter into the pan that's so satisfying okay now I'm going to take the smaller planet and oppress it down in the center of the batter and just wiggle it around okay that's good okay now I'm gonna place it in the oven for 35 minutes I'm gonna let it cool until then I'm gonna be making the Cheesecake part but to make the Cheesecake portion of this need 650 grams of cream cheese half a cup of sugar a teaspoon of vanilla extract and one whole egg and whisk this all together until it's well combined Phil whisk isn't working you can use a rubber spatula or wooden spoon and it just works better because I think the cream cheese is a little bit too hard since it's cold oh man this is a workout this sounds so funny listen to this now that the cream cheese portion is done I'm just gonna wait for the brownies to bake it in and cool down a little bit and then we're gonna start assembling the cake so the brownie has been baking for 35 minutes and in instructions say to wait about five minutes before you start pushing the pan down and to the side so that it kind of makes like the trust of the Cheesecake the pans super hot so I'm going to use this towel to push the middle pan in because I didn't have the right pan what I'm doing is that I'm actually trying to expand it a little bit so that it creates more room for the cheesecake [Music] okay now that it's cooled down I'm going to take my or your either the Double Stuf did Oreos and I'm going to line up the bottom ten okay now I'm gonna be pouring the cream cheese on top of it once I put the cream cheese on top I'm going to put it in the oven at 304 and height and I'm gonna leave it in there for 40 minutes and this is what it looks like this is like really heavy I'm gonna place it in the oven at 300 feet in height for 40 minutes and then I'll be right back so the cheesecake is a fully set the instructions told me to keep it in the freezer for 30 minutes so I did that and now I'm gonna remove the Royals on top and then putting it the chocolate chip cookie as the last layer on top I don't think I have enough Oreos but [Music] the reason why I place these two here is because I actually want to cut it over here and how about that nice interior okay we're not going to wrap this chocolate chip cookie and then fix it on top so this is gonna be our final and last and the instructions cited to make sure there's no gaps or anything like that okay I guess that's it and I'm gonna place it in the oven for 20 minutes on 300 feet I can't believe I pulled it off this looks so good I thought it would be harder than this to be honest but yeah it's not that difficult to make so the last and final step is to remove this Bing pad it it start pretty warm but I can't wait longer I'm actually impressed now I'm going to slice up a piece and see what it looks like in the inside I hope it's not too long might not work that's great but it's okay I can't wait longer can I should wait [Music] okay this print is pretty good [Music] oh my god this might be the best dessert I've ever had wow this is so good surprisingly the cream cheese actually cuts the sweet like the richness of the brownie and the chocolate chips and the Oreos and it's just he's so good my gosh who knew it Wow okay you guys have to try this like you have to try this recipe it's amazing this is so good it's still a bit warm I would highly suggest and wait for you to cool down but I have no way longer brownie I think my favorite combo and this five layer cake is the cheesecake and brownie part like hands down that's the two flavors that I'm getting the most and it tastes the best I'm actually going to be taking this cake to my mom's house and I'm going to be recording everyone's reaction to what they think about this cake and yeah I'm gonna be playing that video right now so I'm currently I'm at Mom's house and I'm gonna have everyone try the dessert and see what they think about it so I would suggest to wait on till it cools down because last time it was just so much after it cooled down you can actually see the layers yeah what would you give it out of 10 who said 9 yeah that's me production you got yo Rami yeah no there's Oreos and then shipping okay so that's the cookie cheesecake yes [Music] [Music] Wow javi already happened she's taking ice cream she's digging ice cream with the dessert isn't enough okay stop well guys that's about it for today's video if you guys are try out this recipe

refrigerator completely and we have melted our remaining chocolate chips so we're gonna plop this melted chocolate right on top of the brownies kind of giving ourselves some chocolate glue because we're going to sprinkle more cookies on top so we're gonna spread this chocolate all over the top probably a pretty thin layer doesn't need to be super thick we're not trying to like completely frost the top again for making it glue essentially so that the cookie bits has something to stick to when we sprinkle them on here aside I'm gonna take a sprinkle on kind of push them in scratch your face with your knuckle super brave man push down and we're good these are ready to get cut up so we're going to put them in the refrigerator again let that chocolate get hard and then we're going to cut them into squares and that will happen for lunch this week make sure you like our YouTube page and subscribe if you want to catch updates when we post new videos have a great night", "Nob7k9crrNw": "Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm showing you how to make \nThe Ultimate Slutty Brownies. Now I totally did not choose \nthe name of these brownies, but let me vouch for it right now: \nthese brownies are outrageously delicious! To start you'll want to preheat an oven to\n350 degrees Fahrenheit and then line a 9x9 pan with parchment paper, and I like to spray it with a little bit of \nnonstick cooking spray so that the parchment paper will stick \nto the sides and bottom. Kinda tuck in the corners there and set that aside, and then in a mixing bowl we're gonna cream together 1/2 a cup of softened salted butter \nwith 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 1/4 cup of white sugar,\nand then I'll use a hand mixer to cream it together. It takes a good minute and a half to two minutes \nto get this mixture nice and creamy. This is going to be our cookie dough layer. There's cookie dough, Oreo, and brownie,\nand oh my gosh it's so good! Then we'll add in 1 egg and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and give that a quick mix. Then add in 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda, 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour,\nand you'll mix this until just combined. Last pour in 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips \nand fold this together. Then dump this all into your prepared 9x9 pan and start squishing it down creating a bottom crust. Make sure you squish it all the way to the edges and cover the entire bottom with an even or at least somewhat even layer of the cookie dough. The next layer is Oreo and I like to use double stuffed,\nbut you can also use regular. I just like that creamy center filling. You want to lay these out in a single layer so I do 4x4,\nso that I get a total of 16 Oreos. Then we're going to make the brownie layer \nto go on top, and yes, we are using my recipe for the best brownies ever and it really takes this over-the-top. Pour 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons of melted butter \ninto a large mixing bowl. That's ok if there's a little bit of butter chunks there because you can just whisk  that in \nand it melts real quick, and you want to whisk that together with 1 cup of sugar. Then after about 30 seconds of whisking add in 2 eggs and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and whisk that until it's combined. Then you'll add in 1/2 cup of melted chocolate chips. I'm using semi-sweet again and I just\nmelted mine really quick in the microwave. Then you'll whisk that into the butter mixture \nuntil it's smooth and velvety chocolate. Last we'll use a rubber spatula to stir in \n3/4 cup of all-purpose flour, 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. You want to stir this until it's just combined, then spread the brownie layer over the top of the \nOreo and cookie dough layers. Make sure it goes all the way to the edges and corners. I like to finish these brownies off with 4 crushed Oreos, and there's always just about that many that are already broken in the package, so that works out nicely,\nand some chocolate chips. Sprinkle those on top and scatter them around. These are so decadent it's ridiculous! We're gonna bake these in the 350 degree oven \nfor 50 to 55 minutes.

Hey munchies, welcome to\nthe channel if you're new or if you're not I'm\nAlyssia and I'm stoked you're here either way. I have surprisingly\nhad a lot of people say can you do a video that\nshows healthy convenience store snacks, like gas stations snacks. I don't know why I'm surprised by this but I kind of thought gas stations and convenience stores\nhave a lot of options. So, I was confused about why\npeople really wanted this video and I started to think about it. I have some thoughts I'm gonna share. But my first thing I would\nadvise when asking yourself this question or asking anyone\nthis question, because you're on the hunt for healthy,\nconvenience source snacks is, why? So really knowing what is your goal and why are you gonna\nthe convenience store, is it because you're on the road? Are you just, you know, driving\nhome from school or what? So if you're on the road,\nwhich is usually when I go to a convenience store or gas station, that was kind of my\napproach to this video, is it because you're on Whole30\nand paleo that it's hard? Is it that you're trying to be healthy? Is it because you're\nafraid of eating bad foods? Are you experiencing some guilt or or are you judging yourself? You know, all of these kinds\nof change the intention behind why you want healthy\nconvenience store snacks and that intention will\nimpact your experience. So if this is a matter of you wanting healthy convenience store snacks\nbecause you're on the road, and any of those other things\nI just listed are true. My next question would be how frequently are you really on the road? Because if this is something\nlike for me, I don't, especially in coronavirus\ntimes, I don't travel a lot. There's not that many\nopportunities that I have to go into a convenience store and find a snack. So when I do, I kind of\nknow it's not forever. And do I really need to get\nso worked up over what it is. Again if I was doing Whole30\nor something, then yeah it would make sense, but you\nsee how this intention matters. So the truth is, it's\nactually not hard at all to find something healthy\nat a convenience store. And if you start with the fridge, that's gonna be your best bet for fresh, you know, regarding healthy. So whole fruit bananas, oranges, apples, you're almost always gonna find those. And in the actual refrigerator section they usually have like\nchopped, fresh fruit. I went to a 7-Eleven for this video and all the snacks I'm\ngonna show you today are from a 7-Eleven, but they\nhad, you know, chopped fruit that was mixed like the box I got here but they also had melons and grapes. They had some chopped salads and you know, a lot of times you can\nalso find like celery with peanut butter or boiled eggs. My store didn't have those but those are things\nyou can typically find in the refrigerator at a gas station. Uh cheese, I also found cheese and you know, prosciutto sticks and baby bells and that kind of stuff. That could be a great source of protein especially if you're\non the road and looking for something that will keep\nyou satisfied for longer. Now, here's what I realized\nas I started to contemplate why do people really want this video? So what's hard walking\ninto a convenience store is not finding something\nhealthy, it's deciding not to get something\nunhealthy, because we walk in and we're exposed to like a\nheaven of processed foods. It's just like so much stimulus. And I just want to eat\nall of these things. And why would I want to\npick up an apple when they have Doritos, you know,\nand all the good stuff. So I think the challenge\nis really mental, right? This is mind over munch. It keeps showing up every day. The challenge is walking\ninto the gas station and choosing something healthy. This is a valid concern and\nshould still be addressed. So if you feel like\nyou're forcing yourself to choose something that you don't want, it might be worth it to\njust pick the thing you want and give yourself permission to eat it. I did an entire video about the power of permission\nwith food last year and I'll link that below\nif that calls to you. If I go to a gas station and I need and I want or need to get a snack I'll first check in with my inner wisdom. If you don't know what\ninner wisdom is check out that video first so you\nknow what I'm talking about but essentially asking in,\ntuning in how hungry am I? Am I hungry? Am I just bored? You know, a lot of times\non road trips, I am bored. It's actually okay to\neat when you're bored and it's okay to eat junk\nfood because you feel like it. The question is what\nresonates with your body and heart and mind in\nthis moment considering the big picture of any health efforts you may be making or setting\nintentions around, right? So if you're like, well right now I'm doing Whole30 specifically to learn about what resonates with my body. Then yeah, it serves you\nto get really intentional. But if you're just like, ah I feel so guilty if I eat that food and it's coming from that\nplace of judgment, I would say take a step back and think\nabout why this matters to you. So after I check in with my inner wisdom then I can work out to the outer wisdom which is like the nutrition knowledge. So when it comes to outer\nwisdom, I personally will look more at ingredients\nof a snack these days in my life than I will\nthe macro nutrients. So the main thing I'll look\nat on the label is added sugar because added sugar provides\nno nutrition at all. Again, that doesn't mean that\nyou shouldn't or can't eat it. It's just, if I'm trying to\nmake a very intentional choice considering outer wisdom,\nI would personally look at added sugar, for instance,\nover calories or even fat. So throughout this video I'm gonna go through these snacks. The intention was choosing cleaner items. And by clean, I am defining\nclean as less processed, not good. This is not about, you\nknow, morality in food. I like the word clean because\nit just is a quick way to nod to being less processed. If you don't like the word you can replace it with whatever you like. I'm not saying, you know these foods are good in\nthese foods are bad, okay? So what else is there to eat\nat a convenience store besides fruit and cheese if you're\ntrying to make a healthy choice. Also from the fridge section,\nthese Sabra Snackers, okay? I love this. They're crunchy salty, satisfying. You get the protein from the hummus and you kind of get the\nprocessed food from the pretzel. So it's kind of like\nthe best of both worlds but you get a little bit\nof nutrition out of it. Oka, these kind of refrigerated smoothies, this is Mighty Mango Naked. This one, I just pretty much\nlooked in the refrigerator and this was the one\nthat had no added sugar. It does have, you know,\n68 grams of carbohydrates, 57 grams of sugar, but\nit's not added sugar. That being said it is a lot of fruit. I've joked about this\non the channel before when I did a video about\njuices and this has one and a quarter mangoes,\none and three quarters apples a half an orange, a\nthird of a banana, right? Like, would you eat\nthat much fruit at once? Probably not. That being said, it's\nstill a cleaner choice. So you do you. Okay, Pickled Bites. Yum, I've never seen these before. I was actually surprised how\nmuch healthy stuff they had at this 7-Eleven, but it's\nliterally just pickles. I think they're deal flavored\npickles in a bag, like that's awesome. Alright, so these were some\nlike fruit snacks that did not have added sugar into them. They were just the fruit. So these crispy apple chips, the only ingredient is apples, right? I might not want an apple on the road but if I want a crunchy, you\nknow, processed-like snack then here you go. Maybe that will satisfy you, maybe not. These Orchard Blend, Sweet Persimmon, Tart Apple and Tangy Peach dried chews. The only ingredients are\npeaches, apples, and persimmons. You can't get any\ncleaner than that really. So, and then this is apples fruit squeeze. It's not called apple sauce because actually it's\nnot just apples pureed, this is apple juice concentrate. So that is gonna have\na little bit more sugar but it's not added. So another great gas\nstation food is popcorn. So this is just, you know,\nregular sea salt popcorn. The only ingredient, popcorn,\nsunflower oil and sea salt. I don't know if this\none is air fried or not but you could always look for air fried if you're looking for lower and fat this one's probably not because\nthere's nine grams of fat. And then these Popcorner chips, only ingredients are yellow,\ncorn, sunflower oil and salt. And the White Cheddar Smartfood. I love this stuff so much. It's actually not as bad\nfor you as you might think. And I talked about this in\nmy healthy processed foods video or low, you know,\nI did a video last year about processed foods that\nhave minimal ingredients. So if that's what you're looking for, when you're looking at,\nyou know, gas station foods watch that video because\nI go through a lot of surprising processed\nfoods that have just a couple of ingredients. And this one I compare\nspecifically to, they have like, what is it a Smartfood 100 where it's like a hundred calorie Smartfood\npop compared to this one. And that one has way more ingredients. And it's actually not that\nmuch lower in calories. It's like nominal when you weigh it out. And I actually show you this side by side. While talking, you know, super processed, these are other ones that\nI've mentioned in the healthy processed or low\ningredient processed foods video. Pork rinds, okay? Pork rinds are almost always just gonna be fried pork skins and salt, right? Or, you know oil if they're fried. I don't personally love\nthe taste of pork rinds, but a lot of people do and\nit's actually a cleaner food. Chips, now Baked Lays\ndo have more ingredients but they have less fat\nbecause they're baked. These Lays only have\npotatoes, oil and salt. That's three ingredients. It could be worse, right? So like you have to decide\nwhat's worth it to you. And again, why are you, why\nare you getting this snack? Are you really just like wanting a crunchy delicious thing on the\nroad then why are you gonna force yourself\nto get the apple chips, when are these really\ndoing that much damage? I don't know. I would argue no. I would argue personally now\nmy feeling is the stress. I used to get so stressed\nout about this stuff. The stress that I would\nput my body and mind under, choosing something I didn't want because I was trying to be healthy, actually physiologically that\nstress did my body more damage than just eating the chips. That's me personally, okay? And then pretzels, pretzels are always. I love pretzels so much, you\nknow, it's a could be worse it's could be worse kind of food. Like they don't have too many ingredients. Yeah, it's white flour. It's enriched, but it could be worse. Nuts and seeds are another\ngreat choice that you can find at almost any convenience store. And if you are trying to be\npaleo or Whole30 or whatever, this is probably where you\nshould head to be safe. Watch out though,\nespecially if you're doing a strict elimination\ndiet like the Whole30. You can't eat peanuts for\ninstance, there are legumes, but most nuts are, a lot of\nnuts are fried in or roasted in peanut oil, so you have to check. And sometimes it'll say\nlike canola or peanut oil and you don't know which so\nit's not technically compliance. That gets really tricky. But for the most part,\nyou know, nuts are nuts. What I will say about the\nnut situation is if you go in shell or raw, it's\ngonna be your cleanest bet. Same goes for sunflower\nseeds in the shell. You can't get any cleaner than that. When it starts to come to flavoring, okay? So like these peanuts are salt and lime. The ingredients list gets longer. There's sugar and corn syrup,\nsolids and dextrose, right? And maltodextrin, whatever. There's more stuff in it\nis it the end of the world? If there is some stuff in your\npeanuts and you like them, lime flavored, that's up to you. Like me, I hate raw almonds. I will never eat a raw almond. It just tastes disgusting to me. These Wasabi Bold Almonds, I love these. They're so freaking good. They're not clean. They're not clean at\nall, but they're tasty. And really, you know, it's, I mean, they're not clean but they've\ngot one gram of added sugar. To have sugar is the main\nthing you're looking out for. You can still have a\ndelicious, crunchy snack where you know you're getting some nutrition. Uuhm these Love Corn. I don't know this brand,\nI've never had it before but any kind of like roasted\ncorn snack like this, the only ingredients are\nusually corn and oil and salt. This one also has habanero chili. One other thing I wanted\nto bring attention to was trail mixes, because\nthis is something else you can find at a gas station. And usually this is what trail, I guess trail mixes are technically\nlike for the trail, right? Like you go on a hike, you go on a trail and you've got this like mix\nthat'll keep you satisfied. Well, you know, on a car trip\nis sort of the same thing. If you don't have access\nto a food for a while, then a trail mix should\nkeep you satisfied. Here's the thing, you\nprobably already know this if you're watching this\nchannel, most trail mixes especially if they have\ndried fruit in them they have a lot of added sugar. This is so sneaky. Look at these two packages, which one looks healthier to you? Right, yeah, I mean, you\ndecide for yourself, but yeah this one looks like the branding\nmakes it look healthier. Like look at all these\nhealth claims, protein no artificial colors or\nflavors, no preservatives low sodium, blah, blah, blah. But then you look at the\nadded sugar of each of these. So this one just looks like\na regular old thing of, you know, nut and fruit mix. This one has one gram of added sugar and this one has eight. It's from the cranberries. Usually cranberries are\ngonna have added sugar. This one only has one gram\nof added sugar though. So I would actually pick this one and the ingredients are\njust as clean, right? So you have to read the label and don't go based on\nthe sneaky marketing. That being said maybe you\nwant really sweet cranberries in your trail mix, you know. Eating at a gas station is not forever. At least if you're going\non a road trip, I mean you're not gonna die from\neating some added sugar on your cranberries,\nor even from, you know picking the honey bun or the powdered sugar\ndonuts that I like to eat at a gas station, right? Like maybe when you're on a road trip this is the one time you get\nto indulge in eating some of those, you know, nostalgic\ngas station favorites, that you don't let\nyourself have very often or that you don't have the\nopportunity to have very often. So for me, giving myself permission in those contexts to say, no this is when I really want to\nhave the powdered sugar donuts and enjoy them fully. That's what works for me. The next go-to at a gas station or convenience store would be\nlike protein or meat snacks. So Jerkys is what a lot of people go for for a healthy snack. To be honest, the 7-Eleven I was at had no clean Jerkys at all. There are clean Jerkys now. Like it used to be you couldn't find a jerky without added sugar. You can find it now,\nbut not at my 7-Eleven. So these, are both, you know,\none has seven grams of sugar. The second ingredient is sugar. The Turkey Jerky has\nonly four grams of sugar but the second ingredient or maybe it's third\ningredient is still sugar. The Turkey Jerky has a really long a much longer ingredients list. So by the kind of arbitrary\nrule I gave you at the beginning of the video where I said, I\ngo by ingredients, you know and I look at sugar, whatever, I'm kind of breaking that rule because I would actually\npick this one over this. Why would I pick it? I like the way it tastes. I actually prefer the taste and texture of Turkey jerky, right? So this is the point you guys, there are no rules and any rule,\nhard and fast rules you set around food are only\ngonna make you miserable. They only made me miserable. I should speak from my\nexperience, huh, okay. These rules made me miserable and letting go of the rules\nthat like, I can only eat it if there's this much sugar\nor not, and this can't exist on the label or it has to\nbe this many, whatever. All that stuff drove me nuts. At the end of the day,\nit's one snack, okay? It's one snack on one car\ntrip, pick the one you want. This beef steak thing,\nthis looks so disgusting. I've never eaten one of these, but I had to get it\nbecause it was an option. So it's pretty much just\nas bad as the jerky. I mean, not as bad, it\nhas two grams of sugar but has a bunch of, Oh, it has MSG in it. Ooh, it's probably good. This Ahi Tuna Jerky Strip. I've never seen this or tried it before but I was impressed. It doesn't have any added sugar. The ingredients are\npretty clean and you know, it's a good option for a\nlow, moderately low calorie. It's a hundred calories,\nhigh protein, clean snack. You can also buy tuna at the gas station. Who knew 7-Eleven sold\nlike regular chunk tuna. Now this is not, I would\nsay this is probably not ideal to like get in\nyour car and eat this. Unless you have a, a can\nopener in the middle console, then it's not gonna be\nfeasible or easy to eat. But this little Wild Tuna\nMeal Kit, 7-Select brand which I think that's\n7-Eleven brand, right? It's, you know, pretty clean. I mean, it's got crackers. So, you know, if there's\nenriched flour in there, but this could be a good way to\nget a satisfying protein snack. They also of course have a whole\nlike aisle of protein bars. I haven't eaten protein\nbars in a couple of years but I was like, oh my gosh, there are so many protein\nbars now, most of them, I wouldn't, I just wouldn't eat them because I don't like the way they taste. Protein bars don't fill me up. But I wanted to at least\npick one up for the sake of the video, because of\ncourse it's an option, right? And depending on your health\ngoals and your food freedom it might be the right choice for you. I grabbed this. I don't actually like the way these tastes but they had the best,\nthe best ingredients. You know, it's like six\ningredients and it's pretty clean. Personally, I would\nprobably eat the baby bell or the cheese stick which\nhe gives me, two of these would give me as much protein in this. And it tastes way better. The other thing about protein bars, I said that they don't fill me up. They don't fill me up\nphysically, but also mentally. So a lot of times I eat them and I still feel like\nI haven't eaten food. So if I'm really hungry I wanna\neat something where my mind and body both know, okay, I ate. And if I'm wanting to eat a processed food and I'm just like, oh,\nthe protein bar kind of like satisfies the process, you\nknow, food itch or whatever. It doesn't for me anymore. It used to, now I want the real deal. I want, you know, the donuts\nor the chips or whatever. So I couldn't go into a gas station without buying a candy bar, right? So I have a Twix bar here and\nI also have this healthier Hu, Hu, Hu Get Back To Human Chocolate. So it's dark chocolate. I don't like dark chocolate. It's also organic, 70%\ncacao, vegan, paleo. I'm the wrong person to ask. I'm not a chocolate person. I like Twix bars, I like snicker bars, but not because I like chocolates 'cause of all the other good stuff in it. So, this would bring me no joy. Would it bring you joy? Maybe if you're someone\nwho likes dark chocolate, I would rather have the Twix bar. So again, intention here matters. If your intention is\ntrying to satisfy a deep desire to have a Snickers bar, right? This is probably not gonna do it. And this is why a lot of times\nwe can eat these substitutes and then still feel hungry or unsatisfied mentally and physically. But if you're just like, no,\nI really like dark chocolate and I really want a square\nof it to just, you know, have a little sweet after\nmy lunch or whatever then maybe it satisfies you. The only way to know is to\ntune into your inner wisdom. No one outside can tell you. Okay and the last snack is\nnot one I would recommend for if you want to eat\nhealthy at a convenience store but I saw them and I\ncouldn't not buy them. So I figured I'd buy it and taste it. These are pop tart bites. I couldn't resist. So there's 40 grams of sugar\nand 41 grams of added sugar. Oh my gosh, look so cute. Smell your food before you\neat it it'll taste better. There's your mindfulness tip. Oh my God, hmm. It tastes exactly like\nyou think it would taste. It's perfect, oh my gosh, that's so good. It's like a miniature\nPop-Tart that's almost better because there's a better\nratio of like icing, icing to cookie or pastry\nor whatever mixture than on a regular side Pop-Tart. Oh, these are so good. Not recommended if you're\ntrying to eat healthy at a convenience store, but\nI went to a convenience. I went to 7-Eleven and I saw them and I could not get them, so. So, that is the spread. I literally walked into a 7-Eleven. I was like, how many\nhealthy items can I get? This is what I found. I hope that it, you know,\nsupports your journey in some way. The goal was not for me to tell you these are the snacks to\nget, it was to help you really start to investigate\nwithin yourself. What are my intentions here, right? Like why does this matter to me? Just my own experience. I spent so much time, so many\nyears causing myself stress and distress around food and health and trying to make the right choice and then choosing what\nI didn't actually want because I thought I\nwas doing my body right and I was actually causing\nnot just like mental stress, but physiological stress\nin my body, dysregulation. I couldn't lose weight no\nmatter how many calories I ate because of that stress. So this is my mission here is\nto help you not stress so much about food and health, because so much of what we thought mattered\nreally doesn't matter that much, if our stress isn't under control.

(upbeat music)", "I1jRsTFPdyc": "hi guys this is Andrew and this is why we're fat so it's Sunday again warranty day 3042 it feels like I have to do some errands this evening but before that Matt and I are gonna make some brownies for his lunch this week similar to the peanut butter brownies that we made last time I'm using a box brownie mix I'm doing my standard kind of base with a box brownie mix which is the two eggs super exciting remember that ice up out the water for brewed coffee and oil today's brown flavor is cookies and cream cheese cake brownies so we'll get this started and mixed up we're gonna be doing a couple of different add-ins just similar to last time so I don't want to mix it too much I just want to get it started so that I don't over work my brownie batter get the eggs kind of broken up and started incorporated those should be pretty straightforward good alright so anytime you're adding stuff to brownies you're increasing the volume you're increasing the big time last time you baked and a half sheet pan today we'll be making it a 13 by 8 [Music] casserole I guess cuz these have a little bit more time so one and a half one and a quarter cups chocolate chips that's about three quarters of a bag of chocolate chips we reserved the last because we're gonna do something with these for the last bit of chocolate chips here at the ends once they're come out of the oven we'll dress them up a little bit fantastic it smells really good with the coffee and add okay you set these aside for a second and now we're gonna make these cookie and cream brownies so I have some chocolate sandwich cookies you can use whatever brand you like a couple here I've already cut up some but I will tell you I typically do here is cut them into quarters and let them break up how they break up so I have my knife kind of just run it down the center and we run it down the center again you get pretty good quarters in some places and you get um bits but do not forget your cookie bits because that's kind of a tasty bit that we're going for that take your milk your cookies dump them right inside the dimensions and you're gonna kind of give it a nice good mix through make sure those cookie bits kind of break apart and layer through the brownie mix and we're gonna go in here we're gonna add it to our pan here that's like a good all nice and mixed in good alright we've got that in our baking pan I have a lined baking pan you'll see very much line design when you add a cheesecake elements into anything you need to make sure that you've got good whining on it that way it doesn't stick but I also like to spray the baking pan cuz I'm a little extra nervous and I don't want anything to stick a lot of fantasy go here we're gonna put the brownie mix with the crushed Oreos and the chocolate chips nice and thick in the pan we're gonna spread it out and I got to push it not really spread it was kind of smoosh it now for the deck of the dressing optimum in this bowl I have a 8 ounce package of cream cheese 2 tablespoons of sugar 1 whole egg a teaspoon of vanilla and a pinch of salt I've just kind of mixed it together so we've got a really basic oh and 2 tablespoons of sour creams we've got a really basic almost New York cheesecake base that we're gonna use here we're going to take our thing we're gonna doll up big blobs of it on our brownie mix and we're gonna ripping it through the brownies here so there it's kind of swirled through with those cookies and the chocolate chips that are already in there okay so just take your spatula or knife and kind of push them through like this it's okay to kind of like bottom out because again it's gonna be tasty and we're also gonna do a topping on these so how the top ends up looking before it when it comes out as I'm super a little bit wary of them let's give it a taste super good so these are gonna go in the oven normal brownies take like 25 minutes these probably take it closer to 30 but I'll make sure that I give you the exact time that these came out of my oven understand that your oven may be different this is a standard bake I'm not using any kind of convection or anything like that and we'll be back keep forgetting that don't forget to get like him are you so perfect why", "TVdj_uz9Uqg": "today Kevin and I are going to be trying the newest been in chair for ice creams a lot of you recommended that I try these and we've been looking for them for quite some time appreciate everyone that has brought these to our attention they're still one vinegars we're looking for it's a Walmart exclusive so hopefully we'll find it these were 399 at Target so if I had waited for them to come to our town who knows how long we would have waited because we don't have a target in our town so I just happened to see them but there were three nothing on each like I said and I have the cookies and cream cheesecake core and brownie batter core and I have coconuts for Cornwall core and we're gonna try Kevin's first it is 280 counters for a for food container a half a cup and we'll just read what it says it is caramel and sweet cream coconut ice creams with fudge flakes and a caramel core so coconut and sweet cream coconut and coconut ice cream next time if you hand me the lid I can read this lid while your scoop okay we try to be oh wow we try to be patient yeah you have to to see this it looks like an alien it looks like some some sort of an aliens coming out of there that's that's the caramel core it's gonna get burst so it looks good to me and it looks like one side looks darker than the other once that has is it's like down the middle yeah and once calm wasn't something serious I want to try with it you don't have to eat it off and I want to just I want to give you a good scoop so that we can really try it no it's got a line going down the top oh well there's a clear line let me get a when I'm Tamil and the other ones sweet cream coconut coz one looks like this side looks like chocolate chip and this look not that coconut has fudge flakes and the calm waters called how's that and then you got the caramel core I'm gonna try we're studying I Drive this brown the brown one that's the call and you're gonna try with call Oh trout whisper okay Wow a car looks good that's like a caramel sauce see Bob in a jar it's awesome that's what it guys like it's it's that and the Karma you buy on the jar to put over top of ice cream that's what it's like purely that's what that is it's like a caramel sundae yes and so you're gonna try the other side you know I'll walk up and up but I'd really have the call I get that truly god I love the taste of the coconut and the the flight should get big flakes or coconut and it doesn't mention anything about those chocolate chip pieces with fudge blanks oh they're calling those flakes jamia flake is like a flake of caramel that's not a light cup chocolate to me that's like a bit I don't know I would just call it something else no that's that's very good I like that a lot so you like the caramel side better sorry mom tooth or frozen um it's all really good but I think it would be even better if it was just had been a Hong Kong mmm I love that curl I agree I love it girl but Alex okay the coconuts are really good though I do have to say the cones really good combination those bits of coconut all through there it's a good combination of the show but they could be standalone flavors definitely all right I'm gonna give you a new bowl new dolls and I'm dipping with a nice pan and we'll do the brownie batter for next thing let's put Tammy for my bowl because I'm gonna eat mom okay do you want to show how this one looks this one and this one has a little bit of a the brownie in the middle glistening it's a chocolate and vanilla ice cream with fudge brownies it's chocolate and vanilla ice cream both of them have fudge brownies and have fudge Bramley and a brownie battle core so total vanilla ice cream fudge brownies brownie batter core okay so this honestly this sounds pretty I you know what I'll have my spin in there sorry ma yeah clean it off I'm gonna try a chocolate and the fudge first there's a chocolate brownie the batter okay I think any brownie pits do you Brennan I got a brownie this is brownie no I like a little brownie pieces off in our spirits oh right brownie in Nostrum yeah the picture shows brownie I'll do that watch the vanilla oh it looks so I just plain vanilla no no that is a plain vanilla ice cream wow that the brownie matters home it's very strong with the chocolate it's it's excellent but honestly all you're tasting is that a dark brownie flavor if you like round me that really really rich briny flavor you would love this a man that comes to mother man was a viewer she really likes bright she's know anything ready she's always saying I love reading my job but it doesn't taste like it doesn't remind you like a cooked brownie because I guess because it's an ice cream it's in it's in a chunkier it's not in liquid form but it's a thicker it's a thicker form so it reminds you of the literally the batter that's what you're getting is the batter that do you like that oh why can I think it's good I like it however I don't think it's as good as the cop right um turn the coconut is really good jaggery eyelids are it's no part of the caramel coconut with him okay hmm next these bowls are a little bigger but I only had four of those dessert balls like big balls I'm only giving you a skate bigger than now this one doesn't have anything this is the core no it's a cheese dead corpse and probably ain't singing right this one is chocolate and cheesecake ice creams you know what chocolate cookies that is cheesecake you just couldn't tell because it's clear it's a it's like a clearer that's water yeah it's why this is all boys it's pretty right chocolate and cheesecake ice cream with chocolate cookies and a cheesecake or chunks of cookies you know it does I'm gonna I'm gonna try to give you one gonna gave you some right there it doesn't matter well I want to make sure you get some of everything that's just like the the Cheesecake core is moved over to the side and it's kind of skewed it's not in the middle it's over to the side so I'm having to dip this out kind of funny and I want to make sure I get it see there's huh yeah there's a big chunk of cookies because always they're cookies yeah okay chocolate cookie so now are you gonna throw the chocolate first it's very hard to tell what's cheesecake so I think I got cheese day you're trying it with the cheesecake oh that's good it definitely has a cheesecake slightly sweeter though it's not that it doesn't have that sour flavor of the cheese guy no it's the swing it hesitant I swear it has a coconut I don't know for some reason and to remind them of a nut cream pie it's reminded me of the coconut I love the flavor of coconut oil yeah there's something coconut it going on I really like it does know a little bit I can see the code on the cheesecake remind you of a coconut cream pie love that but it's not strong they almost go called that coconut rum huh that they put some coke if they put that coconut yeah from the common yeah with that cheesecake they could have called it a coconut cream pie mm-hmm we've been excellent that's good mm-hmm I don't have a problem with it's not like that what the cookie pieces are good the cookie pieces had a different texture to it they're really not a strong flavor at all it's literally just a texture thing and they have more like extra brownie piece than a cookie piece mm-hmm that she tastes wonderful because they're not crunchy no that person is squishy like a brownie all right right now out of the three go ahead out of the thumbs or are you gonna clean up the hill can we finish that many house before you survive be inevitable kevin is this is Kevin's personality Kevin let's clean up as soon as we're finished with anything Kevin likes to clean up Kevin likes to do the dishes get it done can we finish unfinished I learned a lot enough to get rid of the mess I think he's wonderful okay in order I like the coconut call one first you know the the cookies and cream cheesecake was a really really really close second and a brownie better I put a more distant dark I agree 100% yeah I mean really these are really really close to each other though the cookies are cream cheesecake I can actually probably eat more of the kuzu cream cheesecake then I could the coconut because the coconut kernel there are so different flavors yeah it's almost like you're getting two different locks it is it's like two different ice creams in the same container and if I was gonna eat this container yeah now they get all the coconut inside first and then do the chrome and save the core for a call now see I don't know I don't know but I began well out yeah we do that too because the coconut has pieces mm-hmm and you could chew on the pieces so you'd want to eat all that caramel first and then anyone with the pieces so that you would have Everlast you wouldn't say you to the car from you do the coconut I do yeah coconut laughs sounds good coconut first oh okay see I would want to have those pieces lives yeah how do I think those yeah they're really good though yeah the brownie batter is good it's just not it's very good it's just that I've had that before it makes like another Ben and Jerry's another brownie another brownie if you've had the brownie ice cream the vintage airs they make a brownie then you've had birds before it's very very very similar I'm sure actually well absolutely love that because she loves the brownie and trust me if you you've had brownie you've had before from Ben & Jerry's these two are truly new but I like the coconuts if you don't like coconut don't get that but I think if you didn't like cheesecake you'd be okay with the cookies and cream cheesecake I think you would be cheap because it doesn't have that sour flavor but you know but it does have a little bit of a coconut a little bit so anyway if you want to be safe and just get the Browning as you've had that before so anyway thank you all very much for watching this video if you liked it please give us a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed we would love it if you would subscribe to the channel I try to get three new videos out every single day I will keep doing that for as long as I can so please subscribe if you enjoyed this and thanks for watching", "6OuJzGA0Umg": "- Have you been searching for\nthe perfect better than box brownie recipe that whips up in one bowl? You're watching \"Preppy\nKitchen\" where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make homemade dishes to share with your family and friends. And today you have the brownie recipe of your dreams at your fingertips. This is everything you could\npossibly want in a brownie and it is just beyond\neasy, let's get started. First off, I'm prepping my baking dish. It's an eight by eight, but you could also use a nine by nine, you'll just get a slightly thinner brownie which is totally fine. What we're doing is adding\na square of parchment paper and I'm just trimming\nwhere the corners are, or I hope they are and then\nwe're gonna place it in. This it'll let our brownie\ncome out in a snap. If you don't do this, you're\nin for a rough surprise after it comes out of the\noven because it will stick. Just fold really quickly, if this turns out I'll be so happy. Okay, look at that, nice and perfect. Now we have a beautiful,\nopen, rectangular prism to pop our brownie batter\ninto when we're ready. Set it aside and onto our bowl. This recipe comes together in a snap, but it helps to get all of\nyour ingredients prepped, so melt one cup of unsalted butter. If you're melting it in the microwave, which is of course the easiest way, just make sure you do short bursts and give it a mix because\nif you go for too long, the water in that butter will\nturn to steam and explode and I've had to clean\nbutter out of my microwave so many times, learn from my mistakes. Also crack three eggs into a bowl, this way you can fish out any shells before they go into the batter. One cup of melted butter\ninto a large bowl. This recipe does call for\na tablespoon of coffee, so save some of your morning coffee or make a fresh batch and feel refreshed. Also, if you are totally\nanti-coffee you can skip this and add like an extra tablespoon of water or vanilla instead, the coffee just wakes\nthe chocolate flavor up. A tablespoon of coffee,\na tablespoon of vanilla, once cup of granulated sugar, one cup, or again 200\ngrams of light brown sugar. You could use dark brown\nsugar if you want too. Time to give it a whisk. Would it be wrong to spread this on toast? This is my sincere\nquestion, hello, delicious. And by spread it on toast, I\nmean eat by the spoonful, shh. You can add the eggs in now and by the by, the order doesn't really\nmatter in the beginning, dump it all in at the\nsame time if you want. (batter swishing) Nice and smooth, perfect. If you love to bloom cocoa\npowder, bloom the cocoa powder. So that means that you would\nadd the cocoa powder right away to the warm, very warm,\nmelted butter and just let it, mix it in, let it infuse for awhile and it will become extra choclately fudgy, but these brownies are\nmega chocolate, mega fudgy, so I don't consider it a necessary step, but I've gotten some questions about it, so yes, bloom away if that's you. Now let's add those dry ingredients starting with my 120\ngrams or one cup of flour, 3/4 of a cup of cocoa powder and I'm using a blend\nof dutch and natural, but you could dutched if you\nwant or even all natural. Dutched cocoa powder will\nbe a little bit more fudgy and it's kind of my favorite, but people have different\npersonal preferences. One teaspoon of salt and\njust sift it in here, the cocoa powder tends to be lumpy, so sifting it is a nice way to make sure there are no lumps and everything is nice and\nhomogenous after being mixed in. One more whisk and this time we're gonna mix it until\nit's almost combined. Be careful, this is a big bowl, but it's not big enough to\ncontain the mess if I get going. (laughs) Sometimes you\njust question yourself, I'm like, \"Am I doing this\nright? Is this really my recipe?\" The deal is that it's\ngonna be a little bit thick but kind of like when\nyou're making a sugar glaze and it's like a big lump,\nit just takes a minute to mix in, mellow out,\nand get with the program. Also, you don't have to\nuse a whisk for this. Not a bad idea to switch to a spatula and just continue folding it in. Look at that, that's\nthe rich brownie batter we're talking about. This room is a nice room temperature, but the counter top is ice cold, (laughs) so some of the butter\ngot a little bit cold, but that's okay. Winter in Connecticut\nis teaching me so much about all of the questions that\nI get from around the world because so many problems never\nhappened in my old kitchen, but they've happened now. Like I was baking a cake the other day and it came out a little bit\nflatter and kind of pock-marked and I'm like, this is not what the cake\nis supposed to be like, I've made this before, it's supposed to be super\nthick and fluffy and amazing. The deal is that that\nbutter was on the counter, like the bowl is basically on\nthe counter for a bit too long and it sucked the heat out,\nso it all chilled too much and instead of being nice and\nincorporated in the batter, you had little lumps of\nbutter hanging around and there were so many lumps of butter that they didn't mix the flour and they melted into little pools and it made the cake dense, so I need to do a whole cold\nweather baking video I think. Let me know in the comments\nif you have other questions that I should address. All right, this is\nperfect now, look at that. What do we have to add,\nsome chocolate chips. You could also add chocolate chunks, you could also add nuts. If you're adding nuts, I would say go for a cup of toasted nuts and then maybe like a\ncup of chocolate chips or half a cup chocolate chips. Before the chips go in,\nI just wanna mention that I do have a marshmallow\nbrownie recipe too which is bananas crazy time amazing. It has a thinner layer\nof brownie for the base, a mega layer of like homemade\nmarshmallow fluff on top with lot's of chocolate\nswirled and over that. It is so indulgent and really\nmwah, click up here for that. In there you have the chocolate chips, just fold those chocolate chips\nin so they're nice and even. (slow jazzy music) Batter's good to go, let's\nget it into that prepared pan. This paper liner is making me\nso happy, I cannot tell you. Get this batter in there, brownie vibes. This probably won't surprise you, but when I was younger I\nwas so into gift wrapping. I would get the fancy\nlittle pieces of paper that were like all handmade,\nwhatever, and nice silk ribbons and intricately wrapped them,\nI didn't have to use tape. (sighs) Those days are totally gone now, that's when I had a lot\ntime on my hands. (laughs) This will self-level out in the oven, but I do wanna give it\na bit of a head start, so I'm just going to push\nit towards the edges. If you want, you can finish this off with a sprinkle of chocolate chips on top, but this is like 100% pure chocolate, so this is good for me. It's gonna go into the oven now at 350 for about half and hour. The center will be just set and this is the sort of thing where if you wanna under\nbake it, just a little bit, it's gonna be nice and fudgy, but you can go a little\nbit longer in the oven and kind of crisp that edge up a bit more. Like a cookie, it's\ngonna wanna settle down and cool for a bit before\nyou handle it or cut it, so just be patient. My brownie is out of the oven\nand it cooled down enough that it's now solid and look at this. Do you see, that is exactly what I want a brownie to look like, that glossy kind of crackled top. Uh, my mouth is watering\nand the smell's beyond. Let me show you why it was so important for the paper liner to be there. There we go, that is\namazing, no fuss, no muss. Do I even have to wash this,\nI will but just for form sake, there's literally nothing in the pan. Unfold it, we're gonna cut some now. That is beyond the shadow of a doubt the fudgiest brownie you could have. It has a nice, kind of like, you know, almost crisp edge in the corner, but the center is like molten\nchocolate, ha! (laughs) For me, it's edge all the way. I actually like the corner pieces because I like the crunchy parts with a little bit of fudgy in the middle, it is one of my favorite things, but now it's time for a bite. Oh my gosh, it's like you're drowning in a giant pool of chocolate and loving every last minute\nof it and this is on last.

pretty much the way you make brownies melt your butter 6 tablespoons of butter with 5 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate cut into small pieces and 3 ounces of unsweetened chocolate adds more chocolate flavor without adding any more sweetness to the cookie now put this over simmering water this is a heat proof Bowl of course just warm until the chocolate and the butter melts together we have one already done over here you have to let this mixture once it's melted cool a little bit before you proceed with the recipe but you need 1 cup of sugar mixed in with our melted chocolate so add that 3 large eggs you want to overbeat this too much just add your eggs 1/4 of a teaspoon of coarse salt 1/2 a teaspoon of best vanilla and sift 1 cup of all-purpose flour and that's all the ingredients except for 4 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate in chunks so now this gets added to your chocolate mixture scrape down the sides of your bowl stir in your chocolate pieces you could use chocolate bits but I like cutting up the very very best imported chocolate and that is your cookie batter so now scoop using about a two inch scoop that's about a third of a cup and you can fit eight cookies and they hold their shape very nice remember there's no leavening of any sort in these cookies just the eggs put this into a preheated 375 degree oven and bake until the edges are just set and that's gonna take about eleven minutes and once you've baked your cookies look how perfect they are they're so moist inside teacher scoop in a little bit of warm water make a nice generous scoop of ice cream using that same two inch scoop that we formed the cookies with put it right on top top with another cookie and press I think they're really great now you can make these ahead of time wrap each one individually and plastic wrap and put in your freezer until ready to serve what a fun tasty unusual dessert double chocolate brownies and ice cream enjoy", "Y-_k7qFaXUE": "hi guys I'm Laura Vitale on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I want to show you how to make some fabulous cookies and cream trifles now you could make one big one and they would be so good but I'm gonna make individual ones because I think they're really fabulous for a party they look super amazing and I always feel like when you make something individually sized it makes you look like you went through a whole lot more trouble and hassle to make something special than you really did so I'm thrilled to share this recipe with you because it's very simple but it is just so good all right I'm going to show you the ingredients you'll need to make the chocolate custard first what I have here which I guess I should have these backwards semi-sweet chocolates and this is my my own vanilla pudding mix that I have shared with you here not too long ago and if you don't have a homemade just go ahead and get the cook and serve vanilla pudding mix and it would work out just as well and you need some milk that's it that's all you're going to need for this portion of the recipe now I've got my little saucepan here ready to go and to that I'm just going to add my milk and my vanilla pudding mix I'm going to add that in and I'm just going to cook this for about three to four minutes or until the mixture comes up to a boil and it thickens really nicely and I will show you what it looks like when it's exactly at that point perfect you can see that thickened nicely and I'm going to take my chocolate chips I'm gonna place them in the bottom of a bowl and then I'm going to pour my hot vanilla pudding mixture over the top and then all you're going to do is you're just going to kind of stir this together you can also whisk it of course until the chocolate chips are pretty much melted if there's a few chocolate chips in there that I haven't melted completely I actually think that's kind of nice because it gives you a little bit of texture but for the most part you do want your chocolate chips to be fully melted when it's there what you can see it's just about where you want it you can see it gets kind of darker and darker in color and it does thicken as it cools this is actually perfect what I'm going to do now is I'm going to cover this with plastic wrap and you want to make sure that the plastic wrap is actually touching the top of your chocolate custard mixture I'm going to pop it into the fridge until it's completely set and completely cools and I'm gonna warn you but it does thicken quite a bit and actually deepens in color as well when it's there I'll show you what it looks like and then we'll move on to the next step my pudding mixture is completely cooled you can see it has thickened so much I'm actually going to transfer this to a slightly larger larger larger bowl but I also have here are some Oreo cookies you can use any cookie you want does it have to be this one I'm just using it because I like it and I have it on hand and you just want to crush them I put them in a resealable like a little zipper bag and just bash it with my rolling pin known as a favorite weapon and till they're like crumbles so you can do it in a food processor as well and then what I have here is some heavy cream that I have whipped to stiff peaks but you want to make sure there are stiff peaks and not butter because if you take this any further it would literally turn into butter which is not what you want okay now what I want to do is I want to lighten the mixture up chocolate mixture up a little bit so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna take a little bit of my whip cream here about a cup or so and then just fold this into my chocolate mixture what this does is it makes a chocolate mixture a lot lighter not only in color but also texture which is awesome so I'm just going to go ahead and do that does it only take a couple of minutes and what I have here is just a bunch of different cups serving cups they can see they're kind of missing match because that's what I have and depending on the size of your serving cups or your trifle dish whatever you put this in you might get four you might get six you might get eight - really all varies in size and I also have some little ziplock back well donut little the big Ziploc bags here in two cups so that they are ready for the assembly line so as you can see it's really easy and it's really simple and you can make this the night before if you're having like a big party and you can use disposable clear cups and then you look like a rock star you can make individual serving for everybody at your party and it takes no time at all so I'm going to continue to mix this up and then when it's ready we'll start layering okay so I've done the first layer now I want to show you how I do it because it's the exact same layering process but just you want to do it twice you start with the chocolate then you do the whipped cream then you crushed-up cookies so I'll show you you do a small layer of each one because remember this is like super super rich so a little goes a long way and then you take a back of a spoon I just kind of push it down on it so that it kind of spreads it just like that does not matter if the flavors mix up because guess what Oh going the same place then you take your whipped cream you do a shrews I made that up of that and again just smear it around like so and I do it you know I fill my little resealable bags with the mixture simply because I'm a mess if I just try to spoon this in it'll just go everywhere and then the final top is some more cookie crumbles just like that okay you can see that cool cut party I'm going to finish up the rest of my little parfaits here and that's pretty much it these are all ready and now the beauty of that chocolate custard like sitting in the fridge for a while means that it already had a chance to set so if you want to serve these right away you absolutely can or you can make them in advance they do I feel like they set a little bit better as they sit because the heavy cream has a chance to really sit well and almost harden it's just a little bit if you give them some time in the fridge like a couple hours or so but you can make them the night before as well for a large crowd but I'm impatient I've waited long enough I am gonna pop these into the fridge because I'm going to serve them later on but I'm gonna let my greediness take the best of me because that's just what I do look at that and I'll tell you what's really fabulous about this the chocolate custard mixture mixed with the whipped cream creates all most like a chocolate mousse so really it's like a chocolate mousse trifle without having to go through the hassle of making traditional closet moves drop the mic walk away because I'm done mmm mmm and it's not just wheat it's perfection mmm that is seriously good like I said it's not too sweet I didn't swing the whipped cream the only thing that was sweet is the cookie crumbles and the chocolate custard from our homemade vanilla pudding mix it's fantastic now I will say each one of these is very very rich even I and that says a lot even I couldn't finish a whole one so really I mean though I have six here I feel very confident when I say that you can make twelve out of this mixture just make them smaller or make sure that you know two people share one because that's a sweet because sharing is caring you know what I mean so I hope you enjoy smile time with me I'll have the recipe all are in the kitchen comm ready and waiting you know you want to make them this weekend so get off the computer get the recipe make them and I hope you enjoyed them as much as I do I'll see you guys next time bye you", "Of-UlQCs3nw": "you know sometimes I wonder the company who makes Oreos called Nabisco if they're trying to destroy the world cuz you know it started off with the Double Stuf Oreos which is a little weird and then you got to the vanilla cookie and then you got it to these weird flavors and and then you have to cotton candy Oreo which I did last week a week before if you haven't seen that the links below I have tried - s'mores one I didn't do it on camera but that was delicious I heard they had a watermelon aurilla which I can't find anymore but I know a lot of people want me to do it because y'all want to see a black guy in some watermelon I get I get the joke and so now we come to the present day where Oreo has run out of ideas they've come up with a limited edition cookies and cream okay cookies and cream cookies and cream ice cream it's vanilla ice cream with Oreos crunched up in it and so they make the cookie the ice cream that has the cookies in it as the frosted that's ended I'm scared that if I eat this everything will blow up so uh you all wanted me to try this let's go but before I open it I mean pour some milk I couldn't find a cup so um don't judge me but here's a package so let's go ahead and open up this bad boy okay hmm I'm sorry thanks no good it's more like regular I have no doubt these are gonna be good but it's like when I bite in it does everything explode this is where Oreo jumps the shark I'm like I'm really scared so there's three rows of these little tight I hate these little tiny rose you get about what seven cookies in each row one two three four seven cook 21 cookies I know I don't need to be eating a lot of cookies I'm just saying this if we know for three dollars so for now whatever it is called that was good kinda expensive let me go ahead and just open for you before okay so that's what it looks like now so they taking a concept of again of the ice cream and but it's like it's Oreo in Oreo I don't I'm a taste one first before i dunk it into my my milk and so let's just do that first please world don't blow up if we're Geographic you know what to say slight after further consideration it just tastes like a dam or real they make you spend more money kind of smaller package for the same thing Oreo smart all right let's see here oh no huh one drop in there oh it's the same cookie : the verdict is if it's the same cookie as the regular Oreos and I like Oreos that means I like these I mean if you want to go by and buy them but like just be prepared to eat Oreos that taste like Oreos you know ice cream in this eye so that's it thanks for watching and I'll see you next video that we split up on money Orange", "Fc3Kwvnw5n4": "[Music] hello and welcome back to you in the kitchen with Matt I am your host Matt Taylor today I'm gonna show you how to make cookies and cream fudge oh yeah I have a couple of fudge recipes already and here is another one really easy to do very few ingredients if I can do it you can do it before I move on make sure to subscribe to my channel hit that notification bell so you won't miss out on any of my new videos let's get started down below the description box you'll find the list of the ingredients and the amounts let's start by taking an 8x8 baking pan and putting some parchment paper in there or aluminum foil and then I just sprayed some kitchen spray in there and then let's take about eight to nine Oreo cookies and just crush them up I usually just put them in like a plastic bag and then just um crush them up in my hands put them on the bottom there just move them out a little bit okay very simple we'll set this aside and now in a sauce pot let's add in about two and a half cups of white chocolate chips and then one 14 ounce can of sweetened condensed milk this is about 400 grams make sure that you use sweetened condensed milk and not evaporated milk pour that in there oh it looks so awesome already yummy hey I just use a little spatula to get it all out all right and then optionally I add one tablespoon of butter you don't have to you adds a little extra flavor and now let's take this over to the stovetop and we'll heat it up until everything melts together all right so we have our heat set to low and we are going to stir and heat this up until all the chocolate chips and that butter melts it'll take somewhere between five to ten minutes all right so you just keep stirring and heating it up until it gets to be like this all the chocolate chips have melted the butter is melted it's not going to be super hot but just warm enough to melt those in gradients and now let's remove it from the seat now we'll add in some vanilla extract about a teaspoon and it's suggest for some extra flavor as well it's not necessary so you can leave it out if you like just give it a good stir great and then we'll come back over here and then just pour it over the cookies making sure to get it all out and then come in with the rest of our cookies and you can even even even them out a little bit make sure your hands are clean you're going to be touching the cookies just kind of push them down a little bit into the fudge so I trimmed away some of that excess parchment paper just so it's easier to cover we want to now cover it with some plastic wrap cling wrap plastic wrap and then we want to put it in the refrigerator and let it chill for at least an hour so it can firm up alright I let it set in the fridge I'll take this out just remove it right out of the pan here we'll wait up parchment paper and then we'll just cut it up into squares whatever size squares that you want to do one thing you can do if you want your cookies to be more fun because you can crumble up even more you can put them in the food processor and just make like a fine cookie powder with them and put those in but we'll grab a piece here look what it looks like oh yeah take a bite mmm all right the cookies and cream fudge is done turned out fantastic if you like white chocolate and fudge you got to give this a try really easy to do if I can do it you can do it I'm Matt Taylor this has been another episode of in the kitchen with Matt thank you for joining me as always if you have any questions comments or requests put them down below and I will get back to you as soon as I can thumbs up down the corner push it don't forget to subscribe to my channel and check out my other videos take care time for me to dive into one of these oh oh yeah", "2U8N_vcXs70": "how are you two friends we're back taste this Thursday returns again second week in a row thank you for coming back and enjoying it with us what we have today it's all you these are cookies and cream brownies so if you remember did we do a taste test on the brownies from before they were the Butterfinger brownies yes yes so if you remember those Oreo but this one that's like icing on it I think the other one just I mean it want to had a glaze I think you have like a chocolate glaze with like crumbles of Butterfinger on top yeah but this does not this doesn't have like crumble of Oreos like it's pretty sure it's just a chocolate cake with white icing with like a white glaze and then um chocolate chocolate swirl all right dig aim come on I can't wait copyright you so they're individually packaged something else we got it's like they didn't cover it with the icing it's like the machine malfunction it was like it was like a huge clump of ice it's like it melted and it all went to the bottom there's one little section like the cookie was still hot ninjas yeah one two three hmm I don't get cookies and cream looks good that's just like a brownie with white icing on it no it's definitely not like Oreo it's not Oreos on the box well they're hostess I don't like fake Oreos I mean I'll eat the box you'll eat the box yeah and then afterwards Ally then afterwards I'll eat the rally Oh better dictor milk probably the aureus from last week or just normal Oreos the aureus from last week so you I'm obviously given a thumbs down I mean with cookies and cream tanks but more of the cream look it should have been cream Felder yeah there's something Oreo crumble on top like they did go with the Butterfinger brownies I thought those were really good like the brownie itself is exactly same n yeah but it's just that put a little bit more effort into this is fine I just threw some icing on in there like good stuff mmm okay so you give it a half I'm probably in there probably half it's just a brownie just a brownie nothing fancy I mean it's supposed to be fancy nothing spectacular compared on the box this the same it's like life-sized see it's the same thickness as smaller than that one product and large to show a tip mm-hmm so there you have it hostess brownies don't don't waste your money you won't really want to go get I think we'd obviously I think we'd like the Butterfinger ones better go buy the Butterfinger ones much better than that unless you don't like then if you don't like Butterfinger then learn to like Butterfinger because it's better than this car anyway we'll see you guys next time [Music]", "6Z-8r4efXyw": "- Do you like rich, decadent brownies, delicious chocolate\nchip cookies, and Oreos? Say hello to slutty brownies. I didn't come up with the name. These are so amazing, easy to\nmake, and beyond delicious. Hey, you're watching Preppy\nKitchen where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make\ndelicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends. These slutty brownies will\nbe whipped up in a snap. So let's get started. (laughs) First off, get a nine\nby nine-inch baking dish and line it with parchment paper. I love lining baking\ndishes with parchment paper because things just pop right\nout, there's no fuss, no muss, and I do not want to try and\npry some delicious baked good out of a pan when it's stuck. No, no, no, not on my watch. After your pan is lined, let's put those dry\ningredients into a bowl. So two cups, 240 grams of\nall purpose flour, in you go, and I'm sifting mine out but\nyou do not have to do that. 1-1/4 teaspoons of salt, in you go. Half a teaspoon of baking soda, and half a teaspoon of baking powder, a little bit of leavening here. Give it a sift and whisk, whisk, whisk. 'Kay, this can be set aside\nnow for a few moments in time. Now, let's grab our stand mixer\nor electric hand mixer out and into the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a paddle\nattachment or a big bowl if you're using an electric\nhand mixer add one cup or 226 grams of unsalted butter, in ya go. This dessert is de-ca-dence. So, add that paddle attachment on and let's just cream the\nbutter up really quickly. This is almost room temperature but we're gonna beat it into\nsubmission, quite literally. (mixer whirs) Pretty good, so I'm gonna add in half a cup of granulated\nsugar, that's 100 grams, and now you can see it's getting lighter, it's getting fluffy. That butter wasn't feeling\nlike being warm and friendly but we made it, so now it looks\nlike this, that's perfect. Time to add in the brown sugar,\n3/4 of a cup lightly packed, and by the by, if you don't\nhave brown sugar at home, or if it turned into a rock and you don't wanna try and soften it, you could just make brown\nsugar at home, it's so easy. You just take your sugar, mix\nin a teaspoon of molasses, start off, mix, mix, mix, and\nthen keep adding as you go on. You can go real dark or\nreal light, it's up to you. I didn't wanna go to the store\none day so I looked it up now I'm sharing. All right, mix that in. While it's going I'm gonna\nadd two teaspoons of vanilla, that's 10 ml, and then\none room temperature egg. This recipe's really easy. The most difficult part is\nmaking sure that someone didn't sneak eat all your Oreos\nwhile you weren't lookin'. I'd actually planned on\nmaking this recipe for you several times but every\ntime I went to go make them magically all my Oreos had disappeared except for like a couple crumbs\nleft in an empty container. Not gonna point any fingers. (mixer whirs) That looks totally good. Right now I'm just gonna\ndump in the flour mixture and, just so it doesn't explode\nout, just move it around. We're gonna mix it until almost combined. Whoa, nobody saw any of that happen. There we go, almost combined, time for the last two\ningredients of our first layer, out of three. So, half a cup of quick oats. Quick oats are gonna be nice in this because they'll absorb more quickly and this is the bottom layer, so it's not getting that\nfull like hot oven bake. You wanna use smaller pieces. If you don't have them,\nyou can blitz regular oats in a food processor or\neven a blender I think and it'll break them up smaller. To this layer I will be adding\none cup of chocolate chips, semi-sweet but you don't\nhave to add chocolate chips. Now, put it down, lock, it,\nand stir until combined. (mixer whirs) This is where I appreciate my mixer because I've broken wooden spatulas before trying to mix cookie dough at this point. It can be really difficult. There ya go. Okay, we can just give\nit one last mix as needed if we see anything hanging on the bottom but then our first\nlayer is ready to go in. So just take a look, make sure those chocolate\nchips are distributed. We're ready to move this\ninto our prepared dish. All right, so just plop\nit right in. (laughs) and now the easiest way to handle this is with your clean little fingers, almost like you are\nmaking a shortbread crust but more delicious. And just lightly press\nit down to an even layer. Unlike a shortbread crust you don't wanna like press for your life. You can let a little bit\nof air hang out in here, it'll be nice. Ready for the next step. So I'm gonna assemble this all at the end, including those Oreos. Just setting this aside and now it's time time for\nthat de-lish-ous brownie layer. Brownies on top, the best. For that brownie layer, we're gonna start off by sifting\nthose ingredients together, same bowl, same sifter, 60\ngrams or half a cup of flour, in you go. Just a little bit, that's all you need, 2/3 of a cup of cocoa powder. I have 1/3 here and, so\nmessy, oh my gosh. (laughs) half a teaspoon of baking\npowder, half a teaspoon of salt, and if you're using\nespresso powder in here to wake up the chocolate flavor, you would add in two\nteaspoons of espresso powder but I actually can't find mine. I'm gonna use some coffee extract or you could just use two teaspoons of a really strong coffee. You're not gonna taste the coffee but it'll make the chocolate\ntaste more chocolatey, if that makes sense and if you don't like it\nyou could totally skip it, it'll be delicious. Sift it out, press those cocoa lumps out, give it a little sift, and\nwe're gonna clean our workspace 'cause it looks crazy. To a large bowl we're gonna add 3/4 of a cup\nof melted butter, in you go. Half a cup of light-brown sugar, in ya go. Half a cup of white sugar, in you go. Start mixing it up. Two whole eggs, room temperature please, and now I'm adding in about\na teaspoon of coffee extract but you could add in two\nteaspoons of regular coffee or instant espresso. Move this around here. Last thing is two teaspoons of vanilla. You could eyeball that if you want. If you're ever wondering how to get that like nice\nsoftly crackled brownie top it's this step. What you wanna do is mix,\nmix, mix and if you want, you could totally use\nan electric hand mixer or your stand mixer or do it by hand. I'm gonna do it by hand\nand I just wanna see that it's completely smooth. You want that sugar dissolved, almost like you're making a\nmerengue but the exact opposite. This could be really fun if you have kids that need to get some energy out at home. Just whisk your little heart\nout but don't spill anything. (laughs) (exhales audibly) Okay,\nthat's good enough for now. This is ready for the next step, which is to add the dry mixture in. Stir that in there. This will be a nice loose batter see the mixture coming together, it's getting super fudgy and\namazing, just what we want, and when that happens we can start folding in\nthose chocolate chips. So just fold them in. I mean, who could say no to this? This is like an amazing dinner right here. Don't tell anybody. Everything's ready, it's time to assemble and get this in the oven. So, get those Oreos out\nof your secret stash and the chopping board too. So, while someone's getting\nthe other pack of Oreos, because this is not\nenough, what happened here, crinkle, crinkle, crinkle in the distance. You can cut a few in half. Just give 'em a really\nquick chop and that way we can completely fill our\nbaking sheet with Oreos. We want every piece to have lots of delicious Oreos in there. This is the fun part, just\nassemble the Oreos out. So lay them in a grid, pop 'em down, and if there are any gaps left over we have some chopped Oreos to fill them. This is a good recipe to use\na Double Stuffed Oreo too because you really see that\nextra filling in the middle when you cut them open and\npeople will say, \"Oh my gosh. \"What is this amazing\ndessert you're serving me?\" Okay, so as you nibble on those Oreos just fill in any gaps\nhere, really cram them in, and then once you're satisfied it's time to add that\nde-lish-ous brownie layer on top. So, use your spatula to move\nthis around and get ready. Then start adding it in. Your goal is this nice uniform layer and you don't wanna disturb those Oreos, they're happy where they are. Okay, now carefully just\nsmooth things out here. Oh my gosh, the chocolate, it is just like wafting up into my nose and it's a de-lish-ous experience. This is ready to go into the\noven 350 for 45 to 40 minutes. You're gonna wanna see a nice crackle top and when you insert a\nskewer into the middle, it'll come out clean-ish. It might hit a pool of chocolate\nhere or there but you know, it'll be done. My slutty brownies were in the oven for about 40 minutes and I let\nthem cool for almost an hour. You don't wanna rush it because\nyou have to get these out without them like being\nsoft and collapsing. That's what happens, ah. So let me show you want happens\nwith the parchment paper. It's kind of magical. Lift up the corners carefully, remove it, and now we can give it a cut. This is a rich dessert. So you can cut smaller pieces\nand no one is gonna feel like they're getting the\nshort end of the stick or you can cut a mega piece. Have some brownie. I just use a sharp knife and you wanna get this to be a clean cut so you may be cleaning\nyour knife off in between. You wanna see all those\nlayers nice and bright. Just gonna cut mine\ninto nine giant pieces. (gasps excitedly) It looks really good. Another cut. Wanna see the inside? (laughs) Hello. And then we can keep cutting. I mean, do you see the magic here. I'm gonna get a closeup of this. This is a bonkers. If you like this recipe, check\nout my ultra rich brownies. They are so fudgy your mind will be blown. But now, it's time for a bite. (light music) (giggles) That is a good brownie. You've gotta make this recipe.

as you can see I have ventured out from my bedroom into the kitchen because we are going to be baking however I've never really made by myself I've always helped my mom or my aunt or my grandma so I have brought someone who thinks she's an expert in baking miss philosophic okay so today we are going to be making cookies and cream brownies because you know what I love brownies and I also love cookies and cream chocolate I was like why don't we put them together so this recipe is not my own I found it from a food blog so I will put the link in the description if you want to go check that out and now we should just get sorry yeah so the ingredients that we will need are 1/2 a cup of butter 1 cup of white chocolate chips one large egg one can of sweetened condensed one teaspoon of salt one and a half cups of all-purpose flour whoa one baking pan paper one microwave staple one with and one spatula and lastly a rolling pin and a plastic bag to crush the Oreos with as you can see these are our ingredients and we've already created the other to 350 degrees Fahrenheit okay so your first step is in a large microwave safe Bowl you're going to put in your white chocolate and you're going to add your butter which is supposed to be left out by the way don't grab it straight to the fridge so then it won't mix around this bar is already half a cup so you don't really have to measure it and you just put it straight in so what you're gonna do is you're gonna put this in the microwave for 30 seconds stir it and I'll put it in for another 15 seconds if your chocolate has not melted yet then put it in for another 15 seconds and stir it however you don't want to put it into too long because you don't want to hurt the chocolate so we will be right back okay so we're back we have our little mixture here and now what you're going to do is are going to add in the egg the sweetened condensed milk and your salt you get a little whisky guys we've got another whisk two times the whisk now I'll be here making baby buns for you to work so what we're gonna do next is we're going to fold in our flour so the exactly sure what that means cooking with dummies okay no I knew we just put in a full day so after you whisked it through angle it should be kind of like this it shouldn't be that thick but it shouldn't be like water so it should look like something like this it has the consistency of the condensed milk okay next we're going to add in our flour and you're supposed to fold it in once you mix it seriously the reason you're folding in your blood are not just whisking in like someone tried to do it's because you want to get the density of the milk into the flour at least that's what I saw online they don't know if that's true so hurry you literally got half of it on this paper towel packet on the island maybe like a quarter of it in actual Bowl you know what everyone wants a piece of this fabulous movie so at this point it should become more like a batter like I cook you don't anything except thinner and so it shouldn't become thicker asking at the flour should fold really nicely too like when you just drop it shouldn't be all linked gloopy should fall nicely and do you want to be sure that from the flower you get all of the little like hum dots I guess you don't want to leave anything flower not mixed well now we're going to put this off to the side and now it comes for the fun part because if you have anger management issues this is great if you take five to seven Orioles depends how much Oreo you weren't even around it and who doesn't like Oreos I mean they're probably stupid but you know you can't help it so what you're gonna do is you're gonna put your Oreos in a plastic bag and you're going to be sure that as close because you don't know the pieces flying everywhere then which of these you're going to try to lay it out as flat as you can in physics and things about every single thing that I do didn't to her and she's gonna take care of all of it she's gonna now you're just gonna mix it up make sure that make sure it's all gummy not like the bad kind of gummy didn't grab your mixture is what you gonna do is you not going to put all of your Oreos in there gonna put of that leave a little bit less okay so the camera turned off but we have got everything under control all we've done is add the Oreos and now we're just gonna kind of even have them in from so should look a little bit like this it's kind of comfy right now it wants to be sitting it should be pretty uniform take a q-tip and you're gonna pour it in throughout the whole thing and so then you're gonna do is you're gonna try to get your things smooth and then you're gonna take all the leftover crushed Oreos now we're just give a sprinkle mom you have to use a metal or nonstick spatula because so it doesn't stick think we don't think we did a good job but you know what everyone makes mistakes and life is about making cakes and figuring out what you're wrong and we're not doing it yet so in conclusion this is the last episode of making presents all right we're gonna pop this into the oven for about 35 minutes basically when you take it out the surface should be like brown and it should be a little bit gooey so you should use a knife right so you picked a check and yeah you will know if it's done when you use a fork Bank or toothpick when you poke it in and come out and there's no little crumbs on it oh and you know it's done also we were going to show you how this looks afterwards but make sure that you wait an hour to let it cool before eating it because you don't want to burn yourself guys that's not cool okay so we set our timer for thirty five minutes and we will be back okay thank you guys so much for watching these are the final product these smell and look amazing so I hope you try these at home and if you do send me a picture on Twitter atmosphere log or comment on my blog because I will be posting the recipe there it's

i melted 155 grams of butter in the pan and then turn the heat off just finishing rating to tangible rounds of dark chocolate when you go to the cooking section with all the flour is the supermarket often they have baking chocolate avoid backs it just doesn't taste very good at all so I don't like boundaries and all of that for melting my chocolate this is just a super quick way to get in your chocolate melted I've got three exit here and two yolks and my favorite thing the vanilla pod just all the way down the center of the pot split it open and then get the back of the knife and scrape it off yeah that whiskey a bit like a sort of phone is little raising agent in this so the only air is gonna get its foreskin working on is this 65 grand this is now perfect it's really important to add the sugar two dots this way you won't knock out all the air and you'll give it a chance to whisk up again in between I can't tell you how much I love brownies but I love experimenting as well how do you disaster but this one really worked I probably ever have it through another whiskey I'm not looking for is to increase like seven times everything meringue see how that's brought up in a little bit but still got some lovely bubbles in there and my chocolates all melted because we don't have not bubbles out just pour the chocolate around the edge of the bowl look at that I'll have that later the tsp 2 tablespoons of flour and we never bought sifting and one of cocoa powder for extra chocolate eNOS little pinch of salt and we fold all together folding is very different to mixing some very slow and gentle process a lot of people use metal spoons but for me I prefer the spatula because you can scrape down to the bottom the ball like that and it does take a little bit of time but that's fine keep folding it around so that do for me there's a few lights in there but there's no quit losing sleep over that let add the chocolate you Queen so just crumble them in I've got 100 grams here I like to put half in now and then once I pop the mix of the tip of humble some more and afterwards so just people the top and then the oven for about 24 to 30 minutes per 20 degrees but do check after about 20 minutes", "XHNG6jNsOn8": "hostess brownies cookies and cream artificially flavored found these on the shelf today 249 at my local Walmart 6 per box these are actually a little smaller than you might think I don't know if there's very good perspective camera shot about 30% smaller than a ding dong like 30% smaller than a hostess ding dong let's say that it really is just a brownie like substance surrounded by like I don't know some Little Debbie frosting here we go bite 1 by 2 by 3 where's my mouth I can't find my mouth somebody I would say that this is a pretty accurate picture it is literally a brownie like substance with some subpar frosting I got nothing suggesting cookies and cream from this at all it was like brownie with chalky frosting on it for me cookies and cream is a big favorite so I got to say I was a little bit disappointed I had hoped for a little more it doesn't seem like it would have been too difficult to put maybe some some kind of sprinkles on the top of it if like some wannabe Oreos or something along those lines maybe it's done something with the frost or maybe even put bits of cookie into the brownie but no no none of those things occurred I give

using semi-sweet chocolate chips versus milk chocolate or dark chocolate is because it's going to give your cookies a nice sweet chocolatey flavor without being too sweet if you were going to use milk chocolate your cookies might be a little too sweet if you you're going to use dark chocolate they might be a little bit too dark and bitter so semi-sweet is absolutely perfect now i have my chocolate chips in a heat-safe bowl which is very important because we're going to be melting them down slowly with a stick of butter so i've got my chocolate chips here my semi-sweet chocolate chips so i've got one stick of softened butter here and i like to just use softened butter because it's going to melt nice and easy into the chocolate chips and there's two ways you can melt your chocolate chips here with your butter so i have it i'm going to be melting these on a double boiler which means i've got a saucepan here filled with about an inch or so of water and what we're going to do is we're going to bring this to a simmer and the steam from the hot water is going to slowly melt your chocolate chips so you want to make sure you're using a heat safe bowl that fits nice and nestled on your saucepan here the other way you can melt these chocolate chips is in the microwave so you can use still want to use a heat safe bowl and you're going to melt it in the microwave for 30 second intervals until it comes nice and smooth and in between each interval you want to give it a nice stir the key here is to melt your chocolate very slowly otherwise if you do it too fast you risk burning it which just is going to turn out terrible so we're going to actually melt this on a double boiler because it's my favorite method of melting chocolate but if you use the microwave that's a-okay too okay so we have we're gonna start with the saucepan with the water without the chocolate and we're gonna have it on medium-high heat and what we're gonna do is we're gonna wait until it gets to a soft boil and then we're gonna lower the heat all the way down to low and then once at that point we're going to put this on and then it's going to slowly melt the chocolate if you put this on while the water is heating up it could risk burning the chocolate like we mentioned before and you want to make sure that that does not happen um so you want to just melt this nice and slow i don't want you guys to get confused with candy melts these are also in the baking aisle you can also get these at the craft store these are really great if you're like coding cake pops or using them as like a fun colored drizzle on a cookie or something but you do not want to use these in this recipe because this is like milk solids and oil and color you want to make sure you're using your standard semi-sweet chocolate chips all right so we've got our water boiling now so what i'm going to do is i'm going to turn it all the way on low and i'm going to put my bowl here and you see all that beautiful steam that's what's going to slowly melt our chocolate and butter together so here we go just kind of judge it along here help it along you want to make sure that you stir it you don't have to sit here and continuously stir it but you want to make sure you don't let this go stir it every once in a while because that way you don't burn the chocolate at the bottom of the bowl our chocolate is perfectly melted smooth look at this dreamy chocolate i'm gonna let it hang out here while we get going on the rest of our cookie dough here in my stand mixer with the paddle attachment i have got some sugar white sugar i've also got some brown sugar which is key sugar i feel like most cookie recipes call for brown sugar and white sugar together okay so a little bit of vanilla yum all right so we've got three eggs here that are at room temperature i left these out on the counter for about an hour so you really want to make sure that whenever you're baking anything you want to use room temperature ingredients room temperature eggs room temperature butter that will ensure that your batter your cookie dough will come together really nice and smooth with minimal lumps if not if any at all so room temperature ingredients is always key also like to crack my eggs in a little bowl here just so i can fish out any rogue eggshells before i add it into my cookie dough mixture in here if i add the eggs straight into here if you get a bad egg or if you accidentally drop in some shell it's way easier to fix the issue here than it is in here and i learned that tip from aina garten the queen herself so all right i'm gonna slowly add in one egg at a time to our sugar and vanilla in here great all right so now you're gonna want to beat this until the sugars and the egg come together as one it takes about three to four minutes so you're going to slowly add in your melted chocolate while the mixer is going but you want to make sure you add it nice and slow because you're you have eggs here and then you've got warm chocolate so if you add all this in here very fast what's going to happen is that you're going to scramble these eggs in here and that's not going to be good at all so it's very important that you want to make sure you slowly stream in your chocolate here we go [Applause] so what we've essentially done is made our own brownie batter now what i said earlier is that we're combining my two favorite things which is brownies and cookies so now what we're going to do is we're going to sift together some ingredients that's basically like the cookie part and then we're going to combine them and it's going to be ooey and gooey and delicious and i've got some ice cream in the freezer that we'll probably put on it i'm getting ahead of myself but that's okay because i get really excited about these cookies over here we've got some all-purpose flour and i'm just going to sift it into a bowl here and i like to sift these ingredients together because we've got our flour using flour and also some cocoa powder and it's just going to mix it all very nice together and you'll notice that these cookies don't take as much flour as like a normal cookie would and that's because they're brownie cookies and you want to make sure that they're nice and ooey and gooey in the center so it takes less flour all right and we're using some unsweetened cocoa powder it's just gonna further our chocolate dream here slowly sift that together and then while we're here i'm also going to sift in some leavening we've got some baking powder and you can't have sweet without salt so the salt is just going to help bring out the chocolate um it's just going to heighten the flavor and make the cookies that much more tasty so all right so we're going to sift all this together and i just love this sifter i have two but i bought this one specifically because i just like cranking it so we've got our dry ingredients all sifted together look how beautiful turn our mixer back on on low we're going to slowly add in our flour and the reason why you want to add your flour nice and slow is because it gives your cookie batter enough time to kind of [Music] come together and incorporate the flour but also you don't want to over mix your flour because then it'll make for a really dense cookie so you add in the flour nice and slow and just as it starts to come together you stop mixing it alright it is perfect look at that if you notice there's some flour here here on the ends it's totally fine you want to just use your spatula here and just kind of fold it all in make sure everything is incorporated this dough looks so good sorry this cookie dough you can tell it's very loose it's not your average thick cookie dough all right now so what i like to do now at this point is add mini chocolate chips and these are mini milk chocolate chips and i promise you size isn't everything but here in this case you really want to make sure you use mini chocolate chips it's going to melt perfectly into the cookie and it's just perfection so and you want to fold these guys in all right what we have here is my trusty two ounce scoop this is what i use to scoop all my cookies with it's two ounces it makes a nice decent sized cookie the size of my hand palm of my hand and i've got a little mini cutting board here and what i'm going to do is i'm going to line it with parchment paper okay so what we're going to do is we're going to use my scoop and we're going to scoop out the cookies one at a time and then once they're all scooped we're going to pop them in the fridge so they can firm up before you put them in the oven one of the reasons why i like scooping out all my cookies before i chill the cookie dough is because once this dough chills in the fridge it's going to be nice and hard and to get in here and scoop it once it's hard would be nearly impossible so i like to scoop them all out let them firm up and then they're so easy to just break apart and pop them in the oven there is truly nothing better than a brownie cookie all right try to get all of the goodness here perfect now another tip the reason why we put a little cutting board at the bottom here is because if you were just going to do this with parchment paper it would be really flimsy and impossible for you to transfer this into your fridge so that's why we put it on a cutting board so you could easily pick them up and you're going to put them in the fridge and let them firm up for about 30 minutes to an hour until you can easily pick them up and put them on a baking sheet so let's chill for like 30 minutes to an hour all right our brownie cookies have been chilling in the fridge and they're nice if you can see they're nice and firm to the touch so we have a baking sheet here and it's lined with a silicone baking mat but you can also line it with parchment paper you're going to want to make sure you line it with something otherwise your cookies are going to stick to the pan but we've got our cookies here we're going to bake these at 350 degrees for about 10 to 12 minutes all right so this is my hot tip of the day my hot cookie tip usually when i make cookies it's for a lot of people or we're going to a party or it's for a special occasion and i make yummy cookies to share with family and friends but sometimes you just want to make cookies and you just want a few for your family or to have for dessert or you just want to bake them on the weekends and you don't necessarily need 24 or 30 cookies at one time so what i like to do is make all my cookies scoop them out put them in the fridge and then once i bake them for that day whatever i want to bake for that day i bake them and then i store the rest in the freezer wrapped nice and tight in parchment paper and i'll show you here i have some cookies that we made last week and so these are our toffee and chocolate candy cookies and i pre-scooped these just like i did with the brownie cookies and i only made half the batch and the rest i store in the freezer and these are nice and hard from the freezer and what's great about cookie dough is you can literally break them off put them on the baking sheet and put them right into the oven you don't need to defrost the cookie dough or anything like that you just break it and bake it and i have these cookies in the freezer i also have some peanut butter cookies in the freezer so whenever i have a craving for a cookie i always can have one because i have cookie dough ready to bake in my freezer at all times i do want to say that i made these cookies last weekend and so usually when i wrap cookie dough like this and i store it in the freezer it keeps for about two two and a half weeks and any longer than that i'll wrap it with really nice and tight with some cellophane wrap like plastic wrap and i'll throw a little date on there so i know when the cookie dough was actually made so that way they don't sit in the freezer forever but our house is pretty cooked we love cookies we're cookie fanatics so the cookie dough typically doesn't last that long in our freezer anyway if you have any questions about storing your cookies or any questions at all you can leave them in the comments below and i will be happy to answer them these look absolutely perfect i just pulled them out of the oven so what you want to do is just kind of let these hang out and cool a little bit that's also going to make sure that the center is going to stay nice and ooey and gooey similar to a brownie so also if you look at them they're kind of nice and puffy they're going to keep their shape a little bit but as they cool they're kind of going gonna settle down and if you know the top of the brownie where it's kind of got that crunchy little top or coating to it the cookies develop that so it's very it's very similar to a brownie and you can kind of see here like you see the little crackly coating here forming so it's going to continue to form as they cool why would you want to combine brownies and cookies i'll tell you brownies are nice and gooey and chocolatey and delicious and cookies are also soft and delicious but they have like a crisp little coating if you put them together i don't know they're just awesome brownie cookies who would have thunk i think i've told you the story about this spatula before maybe maybe not but it's broken as you can see this spatula is about 15 16 years old when dan and i met he was we met in college and he was my downstairs neighbor and i needed to borrow some men's boxers for a sorority mixer that i was going to so i came downstairs because i knew downstairs there was a bunch of guys that lived down there and i was like going to go down there and ask them if i can borrow a clean pair of boxers and dan was the one that answered the door and he was actually making a quesadilla with this spatula and we ended up talking at the door and he gave me the boxers to borrow and he ended up burning his quesadilla which he always mentions and we have held on to the spatula ever since and i know it's broken but i'll never get rid of it um so that's the story on the spatula they are perfect warm ooey gooey look at that you guys you can kind of see where the little mini chocolate chips are sprinkled throughout melted delicious so i've got my warm brownie cookie and some just simple vanilla ice cream one scoop will do you don't want to go too crazy put it right on top another home run dessert these brownie cookies are awesome a chocolate lover's dream if you love brownies and you love cookies why not make brownie cookies in the ice cream takes it to another level these cookies are delicious on their own obviously but with the addition of the ice cream it's cool and creamy with the chocolate oh my god oh my god a little fun fact here i'll show you i am enjoying this in peace and quiet mila and dan are outside and let me show you where the baby is she is sleeping so i'm gonna finish this brownie cookie i'm gonna finish this ice cream you can find this recipe and so many more tons of good cookie recipes but definitely start with the brownie cookies first you can find them all on babyboybakery.com they're so yummy all right three cheers for brownie cookies i don't even know what to say i'm just gonna finish eating this i will see you next week with a brand new recipe oh my god hello did you use my brownie cookies i seriously made brownie cookies [Music] you", "IevFbiVdTQo": "hello and welcome to my kitchen at home now one of the best things about being a baker is getting to experiment a lot and to put all your favourite things together to create something completely new and today's recipe is what happens when you combine peanut butter cookie dough and chocolate brownie now the base of this dessert is going to be a delicious rich chocolatey chocolate brownie and I'm gonna start by melting some good-quality 70% chocolate with some butter so I've got 165 grams of each I'm just going to put them in a heatproof bowl and melt those boundaries once your butter and chocolate have melted together just let it cool down for a minute while you get on with the next bit which is to whisk up some eggs and sugar I've got three large eggs here and I'm going to add to that 330 grams of caster sugar which I'm going to whisk up for about five minutes until it's gone really thick and pale [Music] while my eggs and sugar are whisking together I'm gonna mix my dry ingredients together and I've got 120 grams of plain flour and I'm adding 45 grams or cocoa powder and then a half a teaspoon each of baking powder and salt shuffle that through and by the looks of things my eggs and sugar all ready so I'm going to add my chocolate mixture now and fold that through and when they're combined it's time to add the dry ingredients and again just fold that through or put it on your lowest speed that's all thoroughly mixed in and oh that looks so good really SuperDuper chocolatey because of the extra cocoa powder I put in and now I'm going to bake it and I'm using a 10-inch square tin I've greased it in lined it if ten inches a little bit big for you you can use a smaller eight or seven inch tin and just half this recipe I know a lot of people out there like to make smaller amounts because you can't quite imagine eating all this brownie but I have lots of friends so I'm gonna make a big one and this will be enough for about 16 pieces so I'm just gonna pour that in and then just give it a bit of help leveling it off with a palette knife just make sure it goes into all the corners and then I like to give it a little bang on the worktop just to level it off and get rid of any air bubbles did you want to get a close-up you probably don't wanna close up now this just needs to be baked at 160 degrees for 20 to 22 minutes what we're gonna look for at the end is for a cocktail stick to come out almost clean not quite clean but almost clean so there's a little bit of glue left now it is the peanut butter and cookie dough time which is frankly the best bit so my chocolate brownie is out of the oven it's cooled down completely and now I'm gonna get on with making the cookie dough so got my mixer here I'm gonna start by putting 85 grams of very soft unsalted butter in there along with 150 grams of light soft brown sugar and then 15 grams of Demerara sugar just for a little bit of crunch beat that all together for a couple of minutes just until it's combined [Music] now I'm gonna add three tablespoons of yogurt and 210 grams of smooth peanut butter you can use crunchy peanut butter if you want it's completely up to you I'm gonna be adding chocolate chips to mine so I just felt like smooth be a little bit better so once you put all of that in just mix it up a little bit once it's all nice and smooth and really well combined it's time to add some dry ingredients and I've got 3/4 of a teaspoon of salt and also 150 grams of plain flour and then just mix that slowly until it's just combined it's looking pretty good and now I'm gonna add chocolate chips I'm gonna be using milk chocolate and I've got some really nice milk chocolate I have some seesaw in it just for a bit of extra saltiness to go with the peanuts and I'm just gonna chop that really finely and then whack that in and give it a quick burst in the mixer that is ready and that is delicious and tastes like peanut butter cookie dough mmm YUM you can just eat as much of that as you want there's no raw eggs in it or anything I mean don't you all of it cuz you need to use it now and so I'm gonna dump that onto the top of my brownie and level it off and I'm using latex gloves to press it in with my fingers I just find that a little bit easier than spreading it with a spatula and a top tip would be to make sure you try and get it as even as possible so when you cut through it they all look really neat and tidy all right that's all nice and even and the last thing we need to do is cover it in delicious chocolate ganache so I've got 150 grams of just boiled double cream and I'm going to pour that over 150 grams of dark chocolate let it sit on the chocolate for a couple of minutes just to warm it through before you stir it and once it's had a couple of minutes just give it a really good stir to combine the cream and chocolate and while it's still nice and runny pour all over your cookie dough and then using a palette knife just spread that out so it's nice and even on top and that is looking pretty good but if you look at it as it is now there is no clue as to what's underneath so I give you a clue I'm going to put some Reese's peanut butter cups for little mini ones on top and some roasted peanuts and once you're satisfied that the top has got plenty of stuff on it you just need to put that in the fridge for about an hour or two just to let it set and this is how it ends up and it looks absolutely irresistible I'm gonna chop this one into 16 pieces they're gonna be quite generous pieces so you could actually probably make this go a little bit further and I'm gonna use a very sharp knife [Music] [Music] well that is a pile of Awesomeness I can't wait to hear how you guys like this if you do try it and why not try swirling some jam through the brownie before you bake it to make it a PB&J cookies Oh brownie and if you like this brownie and you want to try other ones then why not check out my s'mores brownie from a couple years ago which is so nice I think to date it's my favorite

next week so I will see you then bye [Music]", "GVw23vxNiiA": "[Music] hi everybody welcome back to crumbs and doilies and I've got another quick easy and delicious recipe for you today we're gonna make some cookies and cream fudge with this quickfire just really easy because making fudge is a little bit tricky so this is going to be doable by all of you and it's so yummy we've got a cookies and cream layer at the top and then we've got a delicious chocolate layer at the bottom it's so easy and I just love it I'm trying really hard not to eat it so let's get on with making it okay so first things first as usual we need to get our tin ready I have this seven by seven inch tin here and but you don't need a tin again you can make this in a ceramic dish or in a bowl or whatever you want and I'm gonna put two quantities in the description box below so this size and a half size as well in case you don't want to make this much fudge but hopefully you do want to make this such fudge because it's delicious so we're going to do all of this over a bain-marie and what a ban Murray is in case you don't know is a saucepan with about an inch of water in it like this and basically we cook everything in a bowl on top of it the most important thing is that your bowl doesn't touch the water because it's the steam that's going to cook all of this okay so what do we need we are gonna need some condensed milk so I've got a whole kind of it here cans are always kind of pretty standard size this is 397 grams very specific and what I've done is I've split that in half like so and we're first of all we're going to make the cookies and cream layer so I've got 280 grams of white chocolate and that's going to go into my metal bowls along with half of our condensed milk so that's going to go over the chocolate I absolutely adore this stuff it's so sweet and sticky and this is what's going to give our fudge this kind of fudgy kind of taste cuz this isn't real fudge this is quick easy cheats fudge so all we need to put in here now is some vanilla so I'm gonna put in about half a teaspoon of lovely vanilla extract now before we start heating anything we're just gonna get our cookies ready because this is cookies and cream fudge so I've got Oreo biscuits here but I mean any biscuit will do for this and it's gonna break them up into little pieces so there's all ready to go when our fudge is ready for it alright so all lots of little pieces of cookies and ready to go so now we need to get our saucepan on to a nice high heat and we're going to boil the water first and then once it's boiling I'm gonna drop it down to a simmer and then we can get the bowl on top so you want to make sure you're stirring this all the time and when it's all nice and smooth and looking gloopy and and then it looks very satisfied we're gonna take it off the heat I've got on a tea towel just in case the bottoms a little bit wet and I'm gonna pour in my Oreo cookies and now we're just going to stir those through quite quickly because this is going to start setting straight away so just give them a really good mix and it already looks it's really fun and delicious now grab your tin we're gonna dump the whole lot in there and now I'm gonna use this little cranked pallet knife here but you can use the back of a spoon or anything really just to push it around move on and make it nice and level spreading it quite quickly because like I said it is setting so when you're happy and it's nice and smooth we need to let this set and it's going to take about two hours in total but we can leave it for about an hour and then we can start with the chocolate one but haha as if by magic have a really good one and it's nice and chills it's nice and hard and but I do need to wash up my bowl actually let me go and do that and then we'll come back and make the chocolate laugh okay we're all clean and we can get on with our second layer which is the chocolate layer we're going to start with 280 grams the same amount of chocolate but this time I've got dark chocolate my preferred chocolate is around 50% but if you like it really doubt you can go in with 70 or even with milk so 280 going in there I'm also gonna add in this time some butter and just kind of mix it a little bit softer because I found when I didn't add the butter it's a little bit too hard doesn't quite match the cookies and cream layer so I've got 50 grams of butter in here so that's going in and we're gonna add some more vanilla so another half teaspoon of our lovely vanilla extract and I'm gonna put in this one a pinch of salt so in there I just really love the salt in the in the chocolate and it kind of complements the sweetness of the cookies and cream layer as well so this time we're not going to add our condensed milk yet and again I found when I made this with the condensed milk in at the first and the first time I made it the oil was kind of split and separated and it just wasn't as smooth so I tried it this way adding it afterwards and it was perfect so if we go back on and we're gonna do the same thing melting this down [Music] so once that's all nice and smooth we can take it off the heat again putting it on my tea towel just to make sure we don't get any water inside the bowl and I'm going to add in the rest of our condensed milk and give it a good stir [Music] so as soon as you start stirring in that condensed milk it starts to thicken it's really silky it looks amazing so now we're going to pour it on top of our cookies and cream layer [Music] just looks so satisfying spreading this out months it's all bare we just again need to let this set so I'm gonna put it in the fridge and because my bottoms layers already been in for quite a while this will probably take about an hour so we're just going to have to wait and how until we can eat it so I'll see you back soon [Music] look at this it looks so delicious and very satisfying it's gonna look even better when we've chopped it up so here we go [Music] how good it is that looks so satisfying and pleasing [Music] there is so soft and creamy mmm from the to complement each other so well cause you've got the nice sweet kind of vanilla acrimony at the bottom on and then the slightly salty chocolate flavor on top that is amazing guys mmm and mmm it's gonna make a perfect gift as well you can package it up put in little bags or something and give it to your friends and neighbors or just eat it yourself I mean I think I'm probably just gonna take the rest of the day off you can just eat fudge is that good so please make this let me know how you get on if you haven't got Oreos try it with different biscuits just come up with some fun stuff let me know how you do on instagram tag me at Sunnydale's and a cupcake jammer and of course hashtag cupcake Gemma so we can all see and share your creations we'll be back soon with another it has to be in the meantime hmm I'm just going to be here eating fudge [Music] you", "rjeb-mVaAB0": "today Kevin and I are going to be trying to new snack cakes I have been Miz's fresh legs deluxe Oreo mini brownies that the Tastykake scoop shop cookies and cream rings the scoop shop cookies and cream brownies were three ninety-nine at Kroger's Chinese lido boxing the missus freshly were 286 at Walmart and there are six packages there's three brownies per pack but these are made by completely different bakeries this is actually we have the North against the side because these things mrs. fresh Lazar made in Georgia and then the Tastykake were made where you looked did you say this of onion Pennsylvania yes so it's a literally North versus South but they look that's so similar you would think there was a man saying yeah so I thought I'm gonna put that together ah thank you I'm gonna put this together in one video and we're gonna see if they are different so these these are like a unique elevator even they do try many well there are many they're really really be made with Oreo cookie pieces six individually wrapped three pot brownies they are one it says one brownie is 170 Cal I'm here in this package we made one brownie there are six servings I think that's Pro package yeah because they're six packages and there were six it's just six servings yeah that's all mean yeah so it's a hundred and seventy calorie free for three dinners right yeah yeah I think put that in a better bag that's not good that has a typical snack cake brownie black hostess brownies the little backgrounds means what daddy will do yeah the Little Debbie brownies yeah they have a it's a very artificial it's nothing like you would ever make your and Halloween your oven it even from a box mix it's just a very artificial brownie flavor but that's what this takes I like it's drop it is little drop- moisture in the middle that's about it now if I was blindfolded I would never guess that that was supposed to be oriental crunchy bit on the top about him if you would have known it was you would have Baba sprinkles or something exactly yes exactly it doesn't taste like an oriental oaky at all no no but I thought it was good for us okay good a little on the dry side not bad I think if you like a snack cake brownies you would be happy with those you should try so these are the Tastykake scoop shop cookies and cream of brownies and we've had some tasty cakes to shop I think that was geminus I should've looked through that for an interview but they were like awesome they were like the most awesome doughnuts so I'm really really looking forward to these in these big very simple they're yeah they're not many but you get eight eight of these and they are 180 calories for one so this was 170 but you got three so the difference in Alice's there was 40 grams three grams and this is 43 there are chocolate brownies with cookies and cream topping I think this is going to be able to try to I think miss me cutting up no bad it is a it is on the driver side but I don't think it's as dry as the mrs. French no but the flavors are so close to each other I don't like the chocolate flavor better in the chaser cake yeah a little bit takes more real yes like a real run yes so mrs. fresh Lynx was like totally artificial brownie but if you Bob the Little Debbie all the time it's you know it is you know that flavor you know what you're getting it really is that same flavor so yes this tastes a little bit more real but would you say cookies and green no it just tastes like a brown chocolate honey almost like I don't I don't get cruising cream that's good chocolate brownie yeah I do think the chocolates better in this one I do you like the toggle better it doesn't very very similar but they're very similar in flavor yeah but if I was going even though these were more expensive at Kroger if I was going to buy one I would go in both test taste but truth be told I would about either one of on the gown no because I thought one of the big snack cake brownie heaters either I don't like no I would rather buy a box of the Ghirardelli in just you just stir the stuff together put in the evidence not a big deal but now let me tell you I lived by those tasty cake scoop shop Donuts again and again and again because they worked so good and there was a big difference I mean they were fresh they were full of flavor and I just really really liked those so I would buy those again again but these are a pass just because they are on the dryer okay they're okay they're not gonna be bad if you're trying no you're not gonna dislike them it's not like you're gonna throw them away or anything but would you make that decision to choose these over something else next time I don't think so yeah so I hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music]", "Ltd1bZXsDRY": "[Music] hi welcome to hot chocolate I'm medica and today I'm going to show you how to make Cadbury Creme Egg brownies because it's almost Easter and Easter and Cadbury cream eggs go hand in hand if you do not have Cadbury cream eggs you can still make these brownies and then will taste amazing but if you do then follow this recipe exactly how I'd show you how to make them and they will come out divine so let's get started so start off by combining 3/4 of a cup of all-purpose flour with a heaping third cup of good quality cocoa powder and half a teaspoon of salt and just stir together gently to combine set that mixture aside and in another bowl I have 2 whole eggs too which I'm going to add 1/2 a cup of brown sugar and 1/2 a cup of regular granulated sugar and just whisk together to incorporate once the mixture is nice and smooth you want to add in a teaspoon of good quality vanilla extract and you also want to add in half a cup of melted butter now if melted butter actually makes like brownies and cookies really really fudgy and chewy so yeah so you have to melt the butter finally I'm gonna add the cocoa mixture and this is the part where the brownie batter becomes that lush chocolaty goodness that we all know and love in a brownie batter and now we're gonna get started with the cremated part so I'm using Cadbury cream eggs you if you don't have Cadbury cream eggs you can like forget this step but I use three large cream eggs and seven mini ones but many ones are probably better I didn't have enough mini ones and then you want to pour about half of the brownie batter on to a foil-lined butter greased 8 inch baking pan nine-inch works too and I'm just using a square baking pan because you know brownies are square shape and you just want to spread that out until it covers the bottom completely and then you just want to arrange all the Cadbury cream eggs on top of this brownie batter now I forgot to mention that the large eggs that I used I chopped them up just to make them easier like more spread out because I want everyone to experience the taste of a Cadbury cream egg in each bite so once you've finished doing that you want to cover each cream egg with more brownie batter the brownie batter we preserve once the eggs are coated evenly you're gonna pop the tray into a 350 degree Fahrenheit or 180 degrees Celsius oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean in the meantime we're gonna make a fondant layer that goes in between the brownies and the milk chocolate ganache layer so combine 2 tablespoons of softened butter with a quarter cup of light corn syrup and a teaspoon of vanilla extract and then you're gonna mix these together until the mixture resembles condensed milk sweetened condensed milk of course you're then gradually going to add in a cup and a half of confectioner's sugar until the mixture is nice and smooth and it's very thick and sticky at this stage and once the brownies are out of the oven and they're nice and cool you're gonna pour approximately three-quarters of this sticky mixture on top and just spread it out with a knife or rubber spatula as best as you can and with that remaining approximately quarter cup you're gonna dye it yellow to resemble the egg yolk in the Cadbury Creme Egg this is totally optional but come on like it's Easter and it's eggs and this is egg yolk so you know you want to make it look as real as you can and once it resembles the color of egg yolk you're going to pour dollops of this yellow mixture on top of the white mixture or just kind of streak it and then using a knife you're kind of gonna create a swirl effect by just running the knife through all of that fondant mixture and it looks pretty cool at this stage it really does then want to refrigerate this mixture for about two hours or until the fondant is nice and set and then you want to make the ganache so for the ganache chopped up of four ounces or 100 grams of milk chocolate and then heat up around a quarter cup of heavy cream until it's boiling hot pour the heavy cream over the milk chocolate and let it sit for about 30 seconds before stirring now I'm using milk chocolate because Cadbury cream eggs are covered in milk chocolate and I like milk chocolate but feel free to use dark chocolate if you prefer and then stir it until nice and smooth so once the fondant has set in the refrigerator you're going to pour the milk chocolate ganache over it then just spread it out evenly you can use a knife you can use a spatula you can use your hands feel free to use whatever you want you just want to get it in a nice even layer now I like to refrigerate the brownies just so that that chocolate layer firms up but you can serve it immediately if you want so just take it out of the pan pull back the layers of foil and cut into squares refrigerating also makes it easier to cut into squares and then you can see those like the fondant layer in the middle these make around 12 to 16 amazingly fudgy chewy Cadbury Creme Egg like brownies [Music] they're so so soft and so fudgy and that layer fun in between the yellowy Cadbury Creme a kind of layer now it tastes exactly like what you get in the Cadbury Creme Egg and then like you know when you bite into the brownie and then like there's the cream egg and you breath bite into that it's so so good anyway don't forget to rate comment and subscribe I really hope you give these brownies a try then I'll see you next time bye bye [Music]", "cR8DdhZ0dPg": "I have been working my husband like crazy trying to get this your

everyone it is the end today I'm going to be showing you guys how to make cookies and cream brownies using Betty Clarke original supreme brownie mix it really didn't make enough super super yummy to my life mixing long gone and add one egg one fourth cup of water one fourth cup of vegetable oil and I'm going to mix it all together until it's nicely combined once your mixture is all combined I'm going to put about one-third of the packet of Oreo into a plastic bag I'm going to gently crush them using a rolling pin once i finish crushed in the order i'm going to put about 1 cup of them into the batter and i'm going to mix them together when i'm done combining the Orioles and the batter together i'm going to put the batter in a 7 by 11 glass baking pan then put it in the oven for 31 to 34 minutes or how long your recipe says to when the brownies are completely cool frosted topped with vanilla and chocolate frosting I got mine at the store but you could use any type of frost and you'd like using that another spoon create a different design on the top but this is optional for we will be covering the top with Oreos the last step is to sprinkle some more Oreos on top since it's what the Browns look like and as you can see the Orioles make the brownies look really really good and I think that people will want to eat them this is what the middle looks like and you can kind of see the Orioles inside and what I like about these brownies is that when you bite down you can taste it or is quite nicely there's kind of a crunch so then you for watching please comment and subscribe and I'll see you guys later bye", "8Q93W8ehcas": "[Music] hi guys welcome back to my channel I know I'm a little bit late but it's okay because I have a really decadent beautiful cookies and cream Retta velvet brownie recipe these tastes like a beautiful dessert from a bakery there's so much so beautiful look at those layers and it's actually pretty easy just take it step by step I have all your ingredients laid out here for the red velvet brownie parts of the recipe [Music] to start we are going to whisk up two large eggs just whisk them up in a small bowl this is not the bowl we're gonna make the batter in so I'll just choose a small bowl it doesn't matter and then we're gonna take a 1 stick or 1/2 a cup of butter unsalted butter pretty please and you're gonna melt that you can just melt it in the microwave melt it in a big bowl cuz this is a bowl we're gonna make our battery you're gonna add 1 cup of white sugar and we're gonna slowly add these ingredients and the techniques involved in pastry are what make the pastry is so delicious so follow these techniques I promise it's tedious but it's worth it so as you can see as I mix in the butter into the sugar you can tell that it starts to melt and make this really beautiful silky texture we're gonna go ahead and we are going to add our vanilla extract now just two teaspoons [Music] and then we're gonna just continue mixing mix mix mix and you'll see eventually it will all come together and just be this really pretty silky texture look at it it's beautiful just butter sugar and vanilla what pastry is beautiful so we're gonna have our for us a cup of cocoa powder you can use any kind you want you can use a really fancy kind if you like I really had trouble finding cocoa powder so I'm just using her shoes it doesn't really matter that much but if you want to bring out your fancy cocoa powder and make this a bomb dessert you you do you do whatever makes you happy [Music] [Music] and now we're gonna add one tablespoon of pink or red food coloring I only had pink but when it mixed with like the cocoa powder and everything it ended up turning red so it worked out and we're also gonna add 3/4 of a teaspoon of white vinegar at this time to that add your vinegar with your food coloring here mix mix mix mix little together isn't it beautiful look how red and nice and then we're gonna pour in our two whisked up eggs I like to whisk them up beforehand because it helps incorporate everything together it helps make sure that the yolks and the whites are completely combined and not kind of you know separating in the batter so make sure you whisk this up completely once you add your flour you really don't want to mix this up too much there isn't a lot of leavening in this so really make sure everything's completely combined because you can whisk ever-loving heck out of it at this point it doesn't really matter but make sure it's really nicely combined beautiful look how nice and red and pretty that is and then we are going to sift in 3/4 cup of all-purpose flour I always sift my flour I recommend always sift you know you never know when there could be like a lump or something I wouldn't I just I recommend if you like baking I would get a sifter and we're gonna fold this and so just kind of gently go around the edges and cut through the middle and just very gently fold this in it looks like it's not gonna come together like it really it just looks like it's completely messed up and it's all done for you but I promise just slowly fold the flour in and you'll see eventually it will come together see there it is it's coming together but as soon you see no lumps of flour no white specks stop you don't want to overmix this you'll be really really sad if you over mix it it'll just be really kind of just too dense and not nice you're gonna want to put this in a 350 degree oven for 22 to 24 minutes you just want a toothpick or knife insert it in the middle to barely come out with just a little bit of really moist crumbs like you don't want it to be too over baked you don't want it to be under Betty really watch it and after you take it out of the oven let it sit in the pan for about 30 minutes and then we want to over line the pan because then you can grab the foil carefully don't burn yourself on the pan but you can grab the overlying foil and pull it out and move it to a baking rack so it can continue cooling I would pull it for another 30 minutes and then you can put it in the fridge I would put it in the fridge as long as you can about an hour if you can if you can't 30 minutes will be fine but you really want to the brownies to be completely cooled like cold because that'll make our next steps way easier and you don't want everything to kind of melt together then you won't get those really nice distinct layers that have a lot of different texture alright and now we are gonna move on to our buttercream frosting I'm so excited it's so wonderful here are your ingredients super easy unsalted butter I added some vanilla it wasn't in the recipe but things always need vanilla three tablespoons heavy cream and 1 and 3/4 cup of powdered sugar very easy recipe so you want to put your softened butter into a big bowl and whip it up with your mixer see you want it to be a little bit lighter in color and fluffier you may have to scrape down the bowl a couple times but it'll come together I promise it will so then you're going to carefully add your 1 and 3/4 cup of confectioner's sugar our powdered sugar and mix that up it's another one of those things where it looks like it's not how to come together but it is I promise you want this to be a really thick buttercream look how beautiful you want it to be very very sick and not liquidy or very loose because we want this to be a really distinct layer so I'm adding my teaspoon of vanilla and my 3 tablespoons of heavy cream and we're gonna continue with being this up like I said we want this to be stiff but we don't want it to be like too hard too soft you know kind of gauge it it needs to like stand up on its own and it once you put it in the fridge and stuff it will cool down and get harder so keep that in mind but if it is too loose maybe add some more powdered sugar if it's too thick maybe add some more cream like how beautiful so now we're going to crush up some Oreos and we're gonna fold those in you can use as many Orioles as you like I used about I think I use 7 Oreos in this recipe but you could use as many as you would like [Music] look how beautiful that is this layer is almost like a white chocolate like candy bar kinda layer it's beautiful and I can just eat that whole bowl so you see how you can just pull those brownies out makes it so much easier so you can just put that on top put your cookies and cream layer right on top and try your best to kind of get it to the edges but you know just make just make it look as cute as you can it doesn't have to be perfect this with how the brownies are it's it's kind of hard to make them look a beautiful but once you cut them into pieces and stuff yeah it'll it'll come together and I'm gonna put this back into the fridge for about 30 minutes while I make our ganache [Music] pretty straightforward you're gonna heat up half a cup of cream over the stove you can microwave it as well you just want to bring it to a light boil as soon as it comes to a boil take it off the heat immediately and you're gonna pour it over about four ounces of semi-sweet chocolate that's about half a cup you can make as much ganache as you want I can't stop you pretty easy pretty straightforward this is it one of the easiest ways to make ganache you're just going to want to mix it up and the hot cream melts the chocolates pretty quickly if you're not using chocolate chips make sure you break up the chocolate into small pieces that'll make your life way easier just keep mixing mixing mixing it'll come together and make sure that there's no lumps of chocolate and then we are gonna add two tablespoons of softened unsalted butter make sure it's softened or it'll bring down the temperature of the chocolate too fast and it won't mix together and incorporate well as you can see it gets so beautiful and shiny the butter helps bring this together and make it just just beautiful it's such beautiful easy chocolate you're just gonna take your brownies out of the fridge one pointing and you're gonna pour all of that chocolate all over the top I did a bad job at making this look beautiful but honestly it doesn't matter because it's gonna be so tasty even though it may be you know a little bit sloppy it's okay it's still beautiful and perfect in its own way [Music] the chocolate may melt the buttercream a tiny bit as you can see on the top it kind of came through a little bit it doesn't bother me if it bothers you add more chocolate and we're gonna chop those up make them into beautiful squares I made them pretty big and I will say I had a cup even half for a serine they're very very very decadent but so so delicious look at all those layers make sure they cool completely and the chocolate is completely set before you cut them so you get those really good layers I cut some before the chocolate was like completely set and it didn't look as cute you couldn't see the distinct layers and yeah that's pretty simple pretty straightforward it seems like a pretty complex dessert it's just a lot of steps and if you take it slow and do all the steps in order it'll come out perfectly you just got to be patient I hope you guys liked this recipe I know it was a bit more complex than the other recipes but I know you guys can do it I know you're smart and I know you have

nummies stuff spin is pretty much all kinda trying I just broke off a piece I know it's awful it's pretty soft for a package for me other than that it's not too overbearing the flavor you can kind of taste the pumpkin spice I wish they put a little bit more pumpkin spice a beer in it or a little bit more cinnamon that's just me but other than that if I were to give this out of 5 stars I would use this a 4 out of 5 okay I have the complete cookie this one's a birthday cake I'm gonna admit I opened it yesterday and I took a little bite because I was just like I have to try one this is a birthday cake it's kind of loaded of sprinkles in my opinion there's the heart of texture and the pumpkin spice flavor I don't know why maybe it's a candy sprinkles alright this I would probably give like but I have a pretty kooky birthday cake flavor economic sicko oatmeal cookie it's pretty true to what it says but this one has more frosting oh well same same split close I don't like it I like it I know it looks nummy Cheers this is very chewy that's like hard to bite into a little at first I'm then afterwards it gets really chewy and soft like Julie chewy like gummy bear to it it's not too sweet I don't know how to feel about it it's very chewy I just gotta say maybe because this has more protein this has double the protein the Lennon Larry's because this pause 16 to the line Larry's have eight so maybe that's why it's so chewy because as the protein has that you know that kind of texture and that taste to it so that's probably why I'm just quickie is a whole lot smaller it would make sense how it seems to me like and everything like that but as taste wise this is generally all in taste why is this whole video but I would give this maybe a two or wouldn't there buying it again speaking I step on GM other one says non-gmo with free soy but I don't I'm not effective phase by food in whatever isn't nothing I'm pretty excited to try this because I like chocolate oh my god tell me that does not look good cuz that looks super almost perfect oh oh this is pretty good there's actually nuts in there I'm guessing the peanuts because it's peanut butter chocolate chip but look look how loaded this is oh my gosh I really like this one and it has 16 grams of protein I don't know why that one moves more gummy err this one is not as bad and this is softer bait I don't know this one's really good I like this up by this again like this is like a 5 yeah though honey this is known in areas of muscle brownie cookies and cream so excited stir of sugar alcohols 20 grams of protein a sugar 20% daily fiber fresh hay like anything that's my faith is this is like so good it's so yummy any so happening look at this drizzle you know sometimes I feel like a lot of healthy snack people whatever just hold back on like drizzles chocolate chips or others decadent good stuff because they're trying to make it more healthy your version but this is pretty like good pack of I saying some nuts on there too is there just a what is this again cookies and cream mmm I love brownies by the way so we go Cheers hmm it's a good it's not as chocolatey has that more chewy texture to it when he grabs a protein so this is more protein than the two cookies I would give this maybe two out of five yeah it looks good Lennie and Larry's other brownie and this one is a triple chocolate brownie this is no joke triple chocolate like it has a chocolate drizzles there's some chocolate chips in there for some reason this is better I don't know what it is maybe it's more chocolate I think this is a whole lot better it tastes better the consistencies a little better even though it has the same amount of protein as the other cookies and cream muscle Brown you bet yeah I like this I honestly what I just again the last Ronnie that I'm Chinese plus four minutes brownie carnivore brownie and again this one is chocolate fudge so that's a lighter chocolate and this is a little bit more dense more thinner chocolate chips on there yeah I think it looks good great interesting it was a whole lot dense the texture seems pretty quest bar like I mean a lot of you pull that quest bars I personally am NOT a fan of whispers whoops it's just me I mean I believe the contents are great and good and everything that phase wise I just don't like it but it did I play as far as you probably like this - it would be like a quest bar but with a little bit more texture because it's a true so personally wouldn't buy this again my opinion now I go I'm getting full by eating all of these Robins fit elite bar birthday cake and a hard time the comments a recording Ola Bart I personally don't like it just a few who like quest bars try this out it doesn't really taste like birthday cake feel cuz it's appointed so let's down for me because I like his big bars no no it's not just a texture but the flavor wasn't really there and I felt like just chewing in a whole lot of protein or something I don't know I don't I personally like it I wouldn't buy it again okay so next there is I don't like the texture but I'm just gonna try it for the sake of this video Berlin's cookies and cream oh my gosh I'm not looking for a seat right I don't wanna try it because I can tell it's not that great but it looks pretty loaded like a whole bunch of Oreos without the cream filling and not appetizing how it smelled oh my gosh I don't want to try this okay okay it's a top bake yeah it's a cookie bar it says cookies and cream but this is weird because this is a whole lot harder texture than this one so I don't know I don't know if they actually put real cake in here sorry wrong way I hope they put actual real birthday cake in here maybe that's why it's a little softer and this is actual like cookies it tastes a little harder to take I don't know I don't like both of these I'm gonna get them again I wouldn't recommend this flavor to those who love quest bars because it's a whole lot harder texture and it doesn't really taste like it in excess we have another puppet Aaron's cookie dough just for the sake of this video I like the packaging you know brave mythology I mean I guess it's not all about looks right what's inside I guess okay this looks comfort I think it's good that he has lots of chocolate chips on there Cheers what the hey there's a whole lot better and it's all completely softer textures off this texture this would be number two birthday cake squeezing cream will be number three as in the hardest texture ever ever made this ice is not too bad this is bearable quest bar people would probably really like this it's a whole lot softer and it has more flavor to it it has more that cookie dough II texture to it you want to get through 20 grams of protein in here then do it so the reason I don't like spice bars is because the texture in itself but honestly if you're dieting a lot of people like quest bars because it's a high fiber content just because it's popular I feel like a lot of people leg quest bars because a lot of people top great stuff but quest bars you know I'm saying this does not take a taste at all that quest bars do you think she said protein that I bought when I was in high school that's the truth not that tasty but then again if you need protein and you're gonna time crunch so get it guys okay think creams does not taste like cookies or cream but I'm sure eating it cuz hungry oh that's birthday cake by the urban guy tastes a lot better then this for some reason texture is completely different both were the same guys both fit elites poking bars but the birthday cake has a lot better texture in the cookies and cream and whose extreme was too hard this was a lot softer they still are very high in fiber guys' 15 grams dietary fiber for a guy my size 30 grams dietary fibers must generally recommended for a 200-pound dude and for it 200-pound ladies to cookie dough from the rocker easy Irvine Harvey stays named love your Munter they don't diss that cookie dough oh we have bars I really like gentle ones but these this one is the peanut butter hi I think I'm gonna like it this has one gram of sugar and 22 grams of protein just a lot for a tiny bar like this oh very coated like butterscotch but it really smells like peanut butter like sweet peanut butter now I feel like this is soft baked not the Robert Aaron soft baked cookie bar it tastes like a soft baked I realize it so far it's not bad oh yeah what's the cake again cuz pretty cake every day is my birthday oh yeah 21 grams of protein in this one and this is one gram sugar a holy stock doodles like actual birthday cake sprinkles kind of looks like a puff part but it tastes pretty soft baked like it again the three or 3.5 this is probably a little too sweet for me even though it has 1 gram of sugar surprisingly then again maybe it's because I've been trying all the previous stuff I've tried so for I think I like to pick up our pie better of the oh yeah lumbar chocolate birthday cake looks like a brownie this is pretty loaded this is more of a cake texture it tastes pretty sharp ladies fascinated the brands.amazing the combat crunch bar since I'm birthday hit 20 grams of protein a super loaded white looks like white chocolate loaded there's no sprinkles on top but if you look really closely you can kind of see there's like sprinkles inside and then they put the white chocolate coating or if it is white chocolate all that is really sweet I think this is white chocolate please fridge that is super sweet gyrl mixture is in here 5 grams of sugar doesn't think I'm bad but still it's ok I would invite again I recommend it to other people who really like sweet white chocolate raspberry comment crunch wait chocolate raspberry drizzled on top I like to smell my food so I guess the whole essence an idea what it tastes feels looks everything it is soft baked that in thighs kind of just looks like the birthday cake this is not as sweet as a birthday cake I feel like if this has that raspberry taste of it but not as much this 5 grams of sugar that is so weird when you're the birthday cake it's super sweet tasting but this is not it's a local buyer and employee GNC recommends is a chocolate fudge brownie 18 grams of plant-based protein for those of you who are more on the vegan side or trying to be vegan side maybe this will be something that you would like let's try it I don't look like a brownie this is pretty oily like inside the pocket do you know just hospitals to be doesn't really look that appetizing I just like it looks like a brownie cake clean but Jane looks like it may have a little nuts in there I'm not so sure what those white specks are but let's give it a try Berkshire is hard I don't like it I'm sorry I just has to fit that out I'm gonna be honest with everything you're gonna try I'm not gonna fake anything because I first they don't like how it just felt like I was chewing something really hard about much taste and I just didn't like the texture and it just kind of tasted bland the other one hit the girl recommended there you go why I've got peanut butter this is a lot and it does stay all in one meal bar I think if you're on the go and you want to eat healthy so maybe this will be for you but I'd rather eat like grills or food stuff and flipping us all in a bar but this business I guess where convenience be well look at that that's so dark chocolate looking wow this looks like an actual chocolate bar no it looks like those mounds chocolate bar whoa it's really coated really soft oh it's not that bad I'm surprised there's layers in there too like what is that probably I would buy this again I probably would try a different flavor but I'm open to it there's so many benefits all in one bar which words are sorry and that's pretty much it if everything the most that I like probably be the cookie the Lynn Larry's cookie the pumpkin spice that's probably my favorite my number one favorite out of all of that but all in one vegan vegan one bar is pretty interesting and I encourage it but other than that I hoped you liked this video yeah if you want to see any more other videos I want to see any of other reviews fitting this all through lated kind of things sting make a comment down below this video like more I get the more requests I get I will do mark all right well thank you the day ok light", "rE0URzD5o88": "I must Missy past few weeks and I couldn't do a video and I thought of starting with chocolate brownies with sour cream for this recipe I'm using 100 grams self-raising flour 20 grams cocoa powder 1/2 a teaspoon of baking powder or baking soda 60 milliliters sour cream 50 grams chocolate chips 50 grams pass the sugar or normal sugar a drop of vanilla 1 egg and 60 grams butter so let's start doing this I'm doing a very small quantity so you can double or multiply this as you wish so at the cocoa powder and into that add the sugar and the butter and mix it well on a low speed and put it on high speed about 1 speed and add the sour cream I am using a low-fat version instead of sour cream you can add yogurt or even buttermilk [Music] now add the baking powder or baking soda and the self-raising flour I mix it on a very low speed and put it too high and expect about 30 September so I have this brownie tan but this is too big for this amount so I am using half of the pen and going to bake this on 160 in a normal oven or 140 fan post about 25 to 30 minutes until the Skiba inserted comes out till so the chocolate brown is ready and I bake exactly 25 minutes and this is how it looks like if you are doing half like this always you can put a foil and make it half and it takes lightly so let's cut it and see how it looks like so the brown is a nice soft and gooey this is actually you can make it well within 20 minutes so hope you will enjoy this thank you for watching", "-zTtwyezAyk": "in today's video i'm going to share my recipe and method for these fudgy but fluffy cookies and cream gluten-free brownies for the recipe you will need 150 grams of butter and 150 grams of chocolate 75 grams of gluten-free flour 50 grams of cocoa powder 180 grams of sugar 3 medium eggs and a pack of these gluten-free cookies and cream biscuits so you can pick up these biscuits at most supermarkets now in the free from section and they're pretty much just like oreos they are cream filled and they have that dark chocolate cookie outside i've also lined a tin this is set to an eight inch square and if you'd like to see how i easily line my cake tins i'll link a video above [Music] i'm going to melt my chocolate and butter and i'm just using a saucepan with about one inch of water in the bottom now we've started boiling i'm going to pop my bowl on top and reduce the heat and then just use that steam to gently melt the chocolate and the butter alternatively you could do this in the microwave but just make sure that you do short little bursts stirring in between so that you don't burn your chocolate now the chocolate has completely melted i'm going to pop that to one side just to cool down a bit while that's cooling i'm going to pop my sugar and eggs in a bowl and whisk until pale and creamy you could do this with a hand mixer or a whisk too so this is what we're looking out for this kind of consistency and color so now that's done i'm going to add in my melted chocolate and butter mix and then sift my flour and cocoa on top carefully fold all of this together so you don't knock out any of the air until it's just combined just check that you don't have any pockets of flour or cocoa that hasn't been mixed in not only am i putting the cookies on top i'm also putting some into the brownies too i'm simply just breaking a few into large chunks and giving it a quick stir through spoon this delicious mixture into your lime tin and then crumble a few more biscuits on top spread them out nice and even so that each piece gets a bit oh there's one left so that's for me while they're baking and i'm gonna pop these into a preheated oven on 170 degrees celsius or 340 degrees fahrenheit for approximately 30 to 35 minutes [Music] so these have just come out of the oven and to check for readiness i've inserted a skewer into the middle and if it has a few crumbs stuck to it like this it's done if it's still a little bit liquidy pop it back in for five minutes and then check again make sure that you allow it to cool completely in the pan and then you can slice and serve it just makes it so much easier i like to trim away the edges first and then i cut them into bite-sized pieces which i get 16 of but if you do like larger pieces you could get nine bigger ones the biscuits do make it a little bit trickier to cut so bigger probably is easier either way these taste amazing and i promise no one would even know that they're gluten free i hope you found the video tutorial helpful and

I'll say that this one is probably not one of my favorites as far as just eating at room temperature but I will eat it it's not terrible it's just not my favorite and I eat it often on the weight peanut bone Sunday morning with a banana for breakfast but let me see if it won't kick it up a notch to make these cookies and make a glaze with the cookies and cream quest protein powder to put on top I think it's gonna make a big difference but we'll see so first of all we start out by opening the quest bar and microwaving it first it depends on your microwave but people do it anywhere between eight and twelve seconds I'm gonna do it for ten because I think eight was a little bit too little last time don't worry my cabinets are extremely clean I washed them several times okay I'm just going to microwave it for 10 seconds yep that sure did heat it up it's already kind of bubbly and I'm gonna tear it into two pieces and then into two more pieces each so four cookies now you can do as many or as few of cookies as you want with this I like to make about four but you could make a 16 little miniature cookies whatever you wanted and then I'm gonna put them on his plate for just a second I forgot last time they kind of stuck to my pan that I used so this time I'm going to use some a little bit of spray oil on it and yeah the 10 seconds was perfect this time in my microwave last time they weren't really that malleable as they are this time so that's good now last time I used my toaster oven pan but this time I'm going to use actually my kids as easy bake oven pan so maybe you could even do them in the Easy Bake Oven the Easy Bake Oven takes a lot longer than the toaster oven so we're not gonna do that I'm just gonna lightly spray that and then I'm gonna put the cookies here well maybe they'll fit I didn't try this before I just came up with the idea right before doing it but no don't fit don't fit they fit pretty tightly but these protein bars they don't really spread out they're not gonna get really any much bigger first breading wise they might may puff up a little bit but not much so I'll be back toaster oven we're gonna put you on pots when they're done and then I'll come back when they're done actually while that is cooking I'm gonna go ahead and start making the glaze we're going to use this cookies and cream flavor quest protein shake powder I've never had this particular flavor before fact very new to using protein powder period I'm going to use about one tablespoon of it now this whole whole bag is one point on Weight Watchers so just using a tablespoon of it and there's like at least six times that much in here is going to be zero points because this whole bag would be one point and we're using just very little of it so I'm gonna use the one tablespoon of that and then I'm going to use the almond coconut milk now last time I ended up eating two teaspoons of it to get it thin enough for it to be spreadable so even though that last time I use two teaspoons I'm gonna still start out with one just to make sure just in case this flavor is slightly different but it looks like it's gonna need another one but it this one is I will say this one is not as thick as the other one with the one so it's a good thing start out with less and you can always add more and this amount of coconut milk is also zero points because you can have I believe a whole cup of it for one point and like up to three quarters of a cup or something like that is zero points so you have quite a bit of it and still be within zero points okay that is a pretty thick frosting or glaze or icing whatever you might call it and it actually has little cookie chunks in it pretty yummy looking so again you could make this more rich by adding maybe a teaspoon of fat-free cream cheese or a tablespoon of true whip or Cool Whip any kind of whipped topping probably would make it a little fluffy yarn so I'm gonna push on cause we got about a minute and a half left of what I'm going to do with the cookies baking them I put them on for four minutes this time last time I didn't really do any kind of timing to see how long I was putting it in but this time I'm putting it in it for four minutes we're gonna see how things look at that point no coming back and let you know okay so we are back and they came out of the oven I only had them in the toaster oven for about four minutes they're pretty hot and warm and I think they're dead I did not turn them over this time but the bottoms are a little crispier than the top so maybe that would have been a good idea because it would be kind of nice to have them crispy on both sides now I will say these definitely have a little bit of a protein shake almost like the old slim fat shake smell I can't know that protein powder but I also smell pretty good chocolate with it so I'm gonna glaze each one just a little bit and this isn't really melting even though they're hot and that's okay because I like my cookies hot anyway ladies each one with the cookies and cream protein shake I see that I heard it and with this view of points and calories is this protein powder is you could really use as much or as little as you wanted and it wouldn't probably make much of a difference in your points of fact even like I said if you use that whole envelope it would only be one point and this quest bar here this particular flavor is only four points so at most it'd be five points if he used the whole envelope of that protein powder and it's that would be a lot not bad I must say I do not like the cookies and cream powder nearly as much as I like the cinnamon and cinnamon crunch one this one definitely has more of a protein powder aftertaste I can tolerate it but I probably will not be buying that particular flavor again I'll definitely be buying the cinnamon crunch that one again that was delicious but this one I think that's the only one I'll have and then this quest bar is high in fiber and high in protein that's why it's such a low point Weight Watchers snack it is 20 grams of protein and 16 grams of fiber so that is huge and the protein shake powder is also 20 grams of protein and trying to find the fiber on [Music] I'm not sure what the fiber is I tore off part of it not oh no it's not much fiber it's only one gram of fiber but still that is a ton of protein so that's the recipe for today and hopefully you enjoyed it", "6b1ZYTEC6iM": "hey everyone welcome back to my channel I have a super exciting video for you all today and it's going to be how to make these delicious incredibly yummy chewy and soft red velvet brownies and it gets even better because these brownies are just as easy and simple to make as they are delicious since they're technically made with only four ingredients so with that let's go ahead and get started we're first going to start off with the ingredients you're going to need and that's going to be some vegetable oil I'm using a Mediterranean blend here you'll also need a can of sweetened condensed milk and then you will need two eggs and then what's really helpful is going to be this non spring cooking spray or vegetable oil that's going to be very very helpful and lastly you'll need a box of red velvet cake mix and moving on to some tools that you're going to need you're going to eat a measuring cup that measures up to about a cup of liquids you're going to eat a fork what I find is so much better is a hand mixer or just a stand mixer you'll also need a small mixing bowl and a large mixing bowl and lastly you'll need some sort of pan to bake your brownies in I'm using this glass pan by Pyrex okay so the first step in making this delicious red velvet brownies is to preheat your oven to 350 degrees ey oven to start heating up to the appropriate temperature while you're mixing everything together and preparing your red velvet brownies alright now that your oven is heating up to the appropriate temperature you're going to measure out 3/4 of a cup of your vegetable oil and then you're going to go ahead and pour it into your small mixing bowl where we're going to mix all the wet ingredients together then we're going to go ahead and crack our two eggs into the bowl along with the oil and then the very last ingredient we need to measure how is 3/4 of a cup of the sweetened condensed milk to mix in with our wet ingredients and now that we have all of our wet ingredients into our smaller mixing bowl I'm just going to get a little bit of mix to kind of get things mixed up in there not thoroughly but just sort of get things going I guess and then you're going to take your bigger mixing bowl and you're going to carefully pour in your red velvet cake mix and like I did here where it just kind of spewed all over the counter now to clean it up and everything okay guys when I say this recipe is super simple I literally Matt it was really really easy so you're just going to go ahead and pour in your wet ingredients to the cake mix in that big mixing bowl and mix away until everything is thoroughly combined super simple right so as you can see here I was struggling to mix everything with the fourth because I thought I could just you know easily get away with using a fork but it ended up being a lot easier when I broke out my hand mixer after I gave up and trying to mix it with a fork but the hand mixer was a lot a lot easier I promise you if you have a hand mixer or a stand mixer just use it it's ok if you have to clean it up plug it in everything it's worth it I promise so once everything has been thoroughly mixed in your mixing bowl you're going to go ahead and prepare your baking pan by spraying some vegetable oil or non cooking spray or nonstick cooking spray onto the pan just like that and if you don't have cooking spray you can use butter or oil or anything like that but the cooking spray makes a lot easier then you're going to go ahead and pour in your brownie mix into the baking pan and the consistency is going to be a lot thicker than a traditional cake mix but it should not be at the consistency of like frosting or dough or anything and then you're going to go ahead and spread it out evenly on the baking sheet and then you're going to go ahead and pop it in the oven for about 25 minutes now depending on the type and size pan you use to bake your brownies in you might have to add or take away a couple minutes but the best trick is going to be poking it with like a knife or chopstick and see if any batter sticks to it after about 25 minutes and that's when you know it'll be done for mine it took about 28 minutes I'm just away baking pan was little thicker but yeah once you're done we'll have a delicious red velvet brownie that's really really chewy and delicious has that flaky texture of a delicious brownie but that's that sweet flavor of a red velvet cake and the middle of it is so so unbelievably soft and moist and it is just delicious I've made this for pot Luck's and for friends and everyone just loves it and again it was super easy to make and it only used four ingredients so I definitely recommend you make this for your next party potluck gathering or anything like that it will definitely blow the mind of your friends because it is a twist on the traditional brownie but it is even better I promise you that so that's it for today's video I hope you all enjoyed I know a little different from what I usually make but I hope you did like this cooking video check out my previous video which was a collective try on haul and don't forget to add me on Instagram Twitter and snapchat and I hope you have an amazing day and I will talk to you in my next video bye", "JcmVjTL-EVU": "and um finally in the brownies i know [Music] hey guys welcome or welcome back to my channel i am des roulette this is chris today is another fit fam fantasy food day today we have buckeye brownies so these are gourmet brownies the company is based out of akron ohio i can't seem to find too much information about the brand like when or where or how it got started or anything about like them at all which is totally fine because um i'm not here to make friends i'm here to eat brownies yeah chris has had buck eye brownies on multiple occasions i have only had buckeye brownies once and it was very recently we kind of got like a christmas specialty holiday brownies variety packs today now we just have the standard variety pack which seems to be available all the time these aren't just regular brownies these are a half pound from what i understand each and they have multiple layers and toppings and all kinds of flavor combinations which one do you want to start with i'm gonna say the oreo one okay this is a formidable this is called the mvp it is a blondie base layered with chocolate cream sandwich cookies topped with cookies and cream cookie dough topped with more cookies and chocolate chips thank god there are not nutrition facts on this package because i would probably run screaming out the door yeah they're easily like over 1500 calories of brownies i'm having a single bite of each and then sobbing into a pillow let's weigh this sucker the mvp brownie is 11 and a half ounces which means that it's more than a half pound because the pound would be 16 ounces oh i did not know that i have no idea yeah let's look at the inside you can see the layers there wow that looks really good actually okay all right you can have you want the big fat piece or you want this guy i'll take this guy wow okay buckeye brownies use all that weight loss i accomplished oh my god all right i'm tasting the oreo a little bit i think it's good i was getting a little bit of the oreo i feel like maybe i wanted more of the oreo i was getting a lot of the brownie and i wasn't really tasting the blondie i suppose so i think that i was probably looking for a little bit more of like a cookie brownie flavor combination i kind of just got like brownie i did too it's good and the rest was fluff and there's a lot of chocolate chips on top which is fine i mean i love a chocolate chip but i whatever thinking of the seasonal variety pack that we had i liked all four of those better and i like that one okay moving on all right which one would you like to try next honestly we're already kind of on chocolate i think we should go to this nutter butter chocolate guy because the other two were kind of like a vanilla base it looks like okay and i don't want to mess up our flavors this is called mr buckeye blondie base layered with nutter butter cookies topped with reese's pieces cookie dough topped with more reese's pieces and a nutter butter cookie okay that's all you had to say okay so this one's only 10 ounces slightly less wage than its predecessor this looks really beautiful does you see layers of reese's pieces in there again pretty good i love peanut butter we know this we know what kind of sociopath doesn't love peanut butter first of all wow okay i have high hopes for this one buckeye don't let me down i would put that above the oreo i think this one's mostly a blondie because there's just like a chocolate crusting at the bottom i taste a lot of the recent pieces though i mean there are a lot of them yes and actually was interesting for as much as i love reese's peanut butter cups which i do i don't like reese's pieces at all what i think they're silly i don't really like regular m m's either i'm like a peanut eminem guy i'll eat a peanut m m everybody uses peanut butter cup i don't really mess with too many other like packaged chocolates or but anything really in that category but i do love nutter butters there's a big nut of butter on top but you like getting that at all no even the peanut butter flavor is mild i don't know guys am i is it just an off day for me maybe i should save some water i mean maybe you're just not a big fan i just feel like the seasonal variety pack i liked better than this one as well i do feel that these two are better yes so i've got high hopes for those they look so good so should we do that one next or save it for last okay so by process of elimination it means it is time for the gift blondie base layered with a frosted cupcake toaster pastry all topped with a sugar cookie top layer and topped with sprinkles it's very pretty it is very pretty oh i know it's pretty but i didn't take it out for air name that movie drop it in the comments down below darren aronofsky he's the director 11.1 so we're pretty consistent between 10 and 11 and a half first one was eleven five second one was ten even this one's eleven one it's feeling good this better be a gift i'll tell you i gotta pay for my own gifts out here very underwhelmed which is nuts because i love the brownies all right so i'm just gonna slice this way how's that yeah and then you can decide if you want this side or this side i'm just going to cut right into here because it must be the toaster pastry layer i cannot wait to put that in my mouth so i do want this little guy it's a little guy is that okay yeah oh my oh yum okay i'm really psyched i'm more more psyched about this one than i was the first two for sure it smells really good um and it's soft oh wow that's what i was looking for sister friend yeah yeah that's good this isn't a brownie it's a blondie so far their blondie has much more strength in their brownie but that's okay you can't hate on that this is amazing it's just so soft and like oh it's just sprinkles i don't really even care for sprinkles they're not doing anything for me really i don't get sprinkles like on my ice cream well yeah i don't really either i mean but that's why it's nostalgics i used to as a kid wow but i'm a fan of it like rainbow sprinkles i can see myself getting out of bed at three in the morning and like hovering over the tray eating this secretly you talking about tonight is that what's gonna happen tonight hoping you won't notice wow yep yeah that's the one oh my god well we got one more it is a little sweet the texture kind of alone makes up for that it's so good okay so now we're on to the last one certainly not least oh gorgeous this is called snickerdoodle and chill blondie based layered vanilla cream sandwich cookies all topped with a snickerdoodle cookie top layer topped with white chocolate chips a cream cheese frosting drizzle and sprinkled with turbinado cane sugar just wait wow this is the one this is the king wrestler we have a full 12 ounce brownie right here it's a brick it is a brick it's literally you can build a house with this you know what else you're going to build with this thunder thighs on me let me taste this immediately oh it's so pretty now the white chocolate chips i have a little bit of fear because those are just pure sugar white chocolate's not real but white chocolate is just like cocoa butter and sugar oh that's why i like it yes so it's very sweet but the cream cheese drizzle is a unique thought for me i'm very very interested in eating that wow i hope it's not too bright sugar up there layers this is the best day ever thank you for getting buckeye brownies for us you're welcome you want me to put on weight love your woman how they are oh what about my boobs i like your boobs the way they are all right cheers oh yeah somebody should be arrested for this oh my god it tastes like brown sugar i can't this is my favorite one me too definitely this is the one to end on for sure actually they went in order we started with what is my least favorite the nutter butter topper was my second least favorite rainbow sprinkles guy was my third least favorite and then this is yours this is my fourth least favorite i.e my favorite right yeah wow i really buried the lead on that one it took me a while to come around to it also super duper sweet the first two were the least sweet it's a shame that they were my least favorite because the sweetness to like flavor ratio was better but yeah these are bomb that's unreal do you want to taste the pistachio pudding oh sure chris has never had pistachios so right now starbucks has a pistachio latte so we went and got this latte and it didn't taste like anything i was like what is going on and then magnolia bakery has pistachio cupcakes he works right near magnolia in the city i was like babe we need to try these like so he surprised me on friday night he brought me home a little duo pack of the pistachio cupcakes so excited we like dig into them and i take a bite and i'm like just tastes like butter butter cream the cake itself i wasn't getting any pistachio whatsoever they were like tiny little sprinklings of like pistachio dust on the top of the cupcake this is like cooked and it just tasted like spiced cupcake so the point i'm trying to make is that i got sugar-free pistachio pudding and i made it earlier today so now chris is going to taste it even just the color oh look how green oh yeah it does it has the smell and everything [Music] oh man maybe it's not right maybe he just doesn't like pistachio i need maybe i need to eat a pistachio but maybe that's what it is it's pretty spot on it's a little mild it's good i'm not saying it's not good it's good babe it's good though anyway and it's a low calorie snack right it is a low calorie snack a serving is a half a cup there are only 65 calories per serving and no sugar and no fat because we use skim milk there are six grams of sugar naturally occurring in the skim milk that's not really a big deal but that's it

and I have to tell you this is so good we are uploading it on wednesday instead of friday we are going to do another one on friday but a subscriber to request to this and we have to do it and we are going to show you how to make a delicious icing that we use for this it is going to be same ingredients for the cheesecake so don't fry and let's get started with the ingredients you will need one package of Oreo cookies two packages of cream cheese one half cup of granulated sugar 2 large eggs one and one-third cup of white chocolate chips one-third cup of heavy cream 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract you can also add mini oreos ok so this recipe it can actually make 20 cupcakes so just go ahead and line your cupcake pan and then you're going to take your Oreo and you're just going to place that at the very bottom of page like cupcakes and the next you're going to take about eight Oreos and you're just gonna cut that in very very small pieces because that's going to go in our cheesecake mixture I'm still right here feeling be canceled sifting through my fear falling from and when you're done chopping up those ate Oreos into very small pieces set those aside in a small bowl and then take a hand mixer and a giant bowl put your softened cream cheese ours was not soften as you can see and then go ahead and take your half a cup of sugar and just put that in there and blend that very very well until it's kind of smooth ours isn't smooth because it wasn't softened and then take your two eggs and put that in their hand that in very well until you get a creamy texture just like that you let our sit for a little bit so it could kind of soften some more when you are done mixing up set that aside because you're going to take another bowl and put in one min 13 cups of white chocolate chips and one third cup of the heavy cream and you're just going to mix that all together and you're going to stick that in the microwave for 30 seconds we put our 315 because they wouldn't let us change the temperature so changed the temperature to fifty percent and instead it for 30 seconds but we hop back because our was a hundred percent and it wouldn't let us change it so keep doing that over and over again until you get a creamy texture actually while we were doing this it looks like it wasn't melting it look like the chips were just drying up and I was freaking out because I was like oh my gosh we have to go back to the store and grab another one ah so it worked out fine and then just dump in your one teaspoon of vanilla extract and just keep blending that when you are done tap the bowl on top of the table so like the air bubble comes out and you will see a lot of air bubbles and then take your chopped up Oreos and just fold that in with that plastic spatula and go ahead and set your oven to 300 degrees and we actually took a one-fourth cup and that's how we measure how much we're going to have in our cupcake 10 and they worked out pretty well so if you have that I would recommend using that and set your oven to 20 minutes and actually perfect and it's icing time all my gosh I'm so excited you'll need two cups of the heavy whipping cream and you're going to take to third cups of granulated sugar and you're going to slowly put that in as you're mixing it until you get like a whipping cream texture just like that and we decided to color are so we use green and blue to make peel and it came alchemy tiffany blue which is even better so when your cheese cake is done set that to the side with the with a pan spill in there for 10 minutes and 1 10 minutes is up let's take it out of the pan and set that for an hour and while that's cooling down put your icing in the fridge so it doesn't melt because it does melt a little bit faster and easier and we are ready to decorate when that hour is up so we just bought that I don't know what that thing is called so the designer tube and it is going to have like an indent thing in the middle of the cupcake so we just decided to do like the normal swirly as you can see why I'm Chrissy and hurry up you do not have to decorate your cheesecake we decided to that because it tastes a lot better but it's fine without it so you can take your mini Oreo cookies and design that you can just put that on top of the cheesecake or you can take parchment paper and melted chocolate and a mini ziploc bag instead the tip of the ziploc bag and decorate any way that you want you can do bows mustaches happy birthdays hard whatever you want and make sure you put like a triangle at the tip of it so you can stick that into the icing so it won't fall off and after your decorating make sure you put it in the fridge to harden for at least like a minute or two when you are done decorating place your cheesecake in a tight sealed container and stick that in the fridge for about five hours or overnight and you are all set hopefully you like this cute decorative idea and don't forget to subscribe like comment share with your

cream at home and the brownie recipe which I'm going to show you today is also very quick and easy if you like this recipe do give this video a thumbs up and subscribe my channel for more videos and do not forget to leave your suggestions and comments in the comment section below and let's take a look at the recipe [Music] let's first take a look at the ingredients we need for this recipe two packets of polio biscuits hundred grams each one teaspoon of melted butter 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla essence 1 teaspoon of baking powder 4 tablespoon powdered sugar 1/4 cup chopped walnuts 1/2 cup milk to assemble this brownie and ice cream together we need 1 piece of this brownie so we'll be cutting this brownie into 4 pieces so for 1 piece we need two scoops of vanilla ice cream and some chocolate sauce let's begin making this whistling brownie with ice cream so here I've taken 2 packets of Oreo biscuits which 100 gram each and I've ground them into fine powder using a mixer grinder now add 4 tbsp of powdered sugar to this 1 TSP of melted butter 1/4 TSP of vanilla essence give this a good mix now add 1/2 cup of milk so this milk is at room temperature and it has been boiled and cooled give this a good mix now add rest of the milk so you need to mix this until it's well combined and it becomes smooth now add 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts so this brownie batter is now ready to bake this brownie I have taken a 7-inch from old which I have lined with butter paper along the sides and at the bottom and I have greased it and dusted it with madda now add one teaspoon of baking powder to the brownie batter just before baking it if you like your brownie to be fudgy do not add baking powder pour this brownie batter into the mold like so now bake this brownie in 180 degree Celsius preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes until it's cooked so before I took the brownie out of the oven I checked it by inserting a knife and at scoped we can see the knife came out clean now I'm going to transfer this onto a wire rack so that it cools down quickly but if you do not have a wire rack you can just let the pound cool on its own you can see the brownie has come out very soft and moist after the brownie was cool down completely I cut it into four pieces using a serrated knife look at the walnuts inside okay so to assemble this is Lynn brownie we need to heat the sizzler plate on medium flame for 5 minutes once heated put it back in its wooden plate and place one piece of brownie two scoops of vanilla ice cream the sizzler plate shouldn't be very hot else you'll end up burning a brownie and chocolate sauce now pour chocolate sauce as much as you like and within a few seconds you'll see the chocolate sauce sizzling this tastes absolutely divine just out of this world just grab your spoon and dig in enjoy", "il9pr2iWC4I": "hi I'm Stephanie gave joy baking calm today we're going to make cream cheese brownies which combine a dense and fudgy brownie with the cream cheese filling so first pre-heat your oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit which is 160 degrees Celsius and you will need a nine inch square 23 centimeter baking pan and we need to line it with a piece of aluminum foil now the best way I have found to do this is to take a piece of aluminum foil and then just take your pan and put it on the outside like that and just form it the foil to the outside of the pan like so and then what you can do is just take that off and then just fit it in that seems to help prevent the ripping of the foil so when we make the first we're going to make the brownie batter we're not going to use an electric mixer for this we're going to just do it all by hand and that's what gives it that really dense and fudgy texture we're not going to beat it a lot so the first thing we need to do in a heatproof Bowl put 4 ounces that's 115 grams of unsweetened chocolate and chop that unsweetened chocolate is chocolate in its roz form there's no sugar at it it's very bitter and it gives us a really nice rich flavor talk ilat flavor to the brownie and then we're also going to add 1/2 a cup a hundred and 13 grams of butter and you can use salted or unsalted whatever you want and just cut it into small cubes because then it will melt faster because what we're going to do is put our bowl over a saucepan of simmering water and we're just going to melt the two together and just stir it every once in a while until they're all melt together okay so your eggs all melted so remove from the heat just give it a quick stir now what I do is I just um check the temperature you want it kind of warm you don't want it like really hot if it's if you find if you touch it and your chocolate is really hot just let it sit for a few minutes because you want like lukewarm so next we're going to add the sugar one and a quarter cups 250 grams and I'm just going to you could use a wooden spoon a spatula I'm going to use my wire whisk now that may seem like a lot of sugar but keep in mind that we used unsweetened chocolate which is really bitter so we're using a little more sugar than what you would use say if you're using semi-sweet chocolate so just whisk that in really well and then I'm going to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract try to use a pure is better flavor than the artificial and then we need two large eggs and we're going to add them one at a time and just beat that in and then the second one as you can see this is really fast and easy to do okay now switch over if you're using a whisk either switch over to like a wooden spoon or I like my spatula and what we're going to add is a half a cup 65 grams of all-purpose flour plain flour and just a quarter teaspoon of salt I like to use a kosher now if you use salted butter I would usually just leave that salt out and then as you notice we didn't use any baking powder baking soda because we don't we want to dance and fudgy brownies so you don't use any artificial leavener and what we're going to do is just beat this by hand because it's quite dull right now so what we're going to do is beat it until it gets nice and shiny and starts to move come away from the sides of the bowl so maybe a minute your arm does get a little bit of a workout here so you can use a wooden spoon for this or if you have a really strong rubber spatula like I have you can use that okay so that's good it's getting nice and shiny and glossy my arms getting sore it's another sign you know okay so now what I'm going to do is remove a half a cup 120 milliliters of the batter we're going to use that later for the top to swirl with the cream cheese give it because if you notice cream cheese brownies have that really nice marble top so that aside and then just going to pour the wrath straight into our pan this is a really nice brownie just on its own even before we have the cream cheese and then with the back of the spoon or I'm using an offset spatula just spread it all out try to get it as even as possible and make sure you get in the corners okay that looks good okay next we'll make the cream cheese filling so now for the cream cheese filling I'm going to use a food processor for this you could use a hand mixer or you could even do it by hand if you want so the first thing you need is 8 ounces 227 grams of cream cheese I like to use a full fat here and have it at room temperature and just put that in there and then I'm just going to process just until it's nice and creamy and smooth and get all the lumps so scrape down the sides if you need to okay so then so then I'm going to add a third of a cup 65 grams of granulated white sugar 1 large egg and just half a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and then I'm going to process this until it's nice and creamy and smooth you don't want to over process it we don't want it watery you still want it thick but just until everything is a really nice and creamy and smooth just scrape down make sure everything gets all mixed together okay that looks good food processor makes really quick work at that and then so what we're going to do is just spread the cream cheese filling on top of the brownie mixture you see it's still quite it's quite thick and that's the way you want it if be careful when you use the food processor because there is a tendency to over process and then it becomes too thin which is not what we want here and then I'm just going to take take the back of the spoon or I'm going to take my offset spatula and just spread that as evenly as possible over the brownie layer this is really nice because you get like cheesecake and brownie all in one I'm sure you get all the sides in the corner okay so now get that done so now you have that half a cup of reserved brownie batter so what we're going to do is put little dollops all over the top I like to put about 16 so I like four rows of four I guess that's maybe a little more than a teaspoon it's not critical so we will be swirling the two together because this is so much thicker than the cream cheese that's why I like to put lots of little dollops like this makes it easier to swirl the two batters together okay so now you can use we want to swirl them together you could use like a knife or a spatula you could use I'm using a wooden skewer you use a chopstick the important thing is we want to marbleize it but we don't want to mix it thoroughly so everybody has their way of doing it what I do is just run it you have to work this alittle cause you can see the brownie batter is a lot thicker than the cream cheese and then what I do is just run it because you don't want big globs of that brownie batter so you want to kind of but we don't want to overdo it that's the trick okay it looks pretty good I'm pretty happy with that okay so now into the oven 2530 minutes so what you want is the cream it will be set the cream cheese filling will start to brown and if you put a toothpick into the brownie part you'll still get a few moist crumbs and although it's hard to tell sometimes the brownies will start to pull away from the side so somewhere around 25 maybe 30 minutes depending on your oven okay our cream cheese brownies are now done if you shake the pan it will be set and you can start to see the cream cheese filling just beginning to brown starting to pull away from the sides and if you put a toothpick into the brownie part it will come up with a few moist crumbs now what we need to do now is let this cool completely and then cover and put in the refrigerator you will need at least 2 hours 2 to 4 hours sometimes what I do is I just make them and put them in the fridge overnight before you cut them because just like a cheesecake needs to firm up so do these cream cheese brownies so now we'll take the cream cheese brownies out of the pan just lift them up by the sides of the foil and put it on the cutting board now I let these chill for about 3 hours so that they're nice and firm and then peel back the foil sometimes what I do is actually just peel it right away from the brownie like so just to make sure it's not sticking and then I usually have a glass of hot water and then a sharp knife and I dip the knife in the water that it just makes a nice clean cut through your brownie now some people like to cut away the edges some people really like the edges so you decide and then just cut right down and then I just put my knife into my water and just cut like so yeah lift it up and there you can see you got a nice brownie on the bottom cream cheese and then the swirl of brownie on the top so there you go and then just again dip and cut I do find if you kind of live like I said and peel that back that's what the foil back that's why you want your brownies to chill for several hours now you can store these in the refrigerator for probably up to about five days or you can freeze them if you want but I would store them in the refrigerator and then you can eat them cold or bring them to room temperature before serving so until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm", "P8X3HRBwMS8": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]", "v5gV_ljiSvU": "[Music] hi i'm manju welcome to sharing cooking secrets today i'm going to show you how to make cookie brownies so for our cookie brownies we need to get all our ingredients ready and prepare your tin this is a 8 inch by 8 inch aluminium tin [Music] first step is um i'll take one tablespoon of flour and half a cup of water [Music] and we're just going to mix this together take out all the lumps and we're going to cook this in the microwave uh if you don't have a microwave you can do it on the stove but keep stirring it all the time it will start to get thick very quickly so in the microwave we're going to cook this in 10 second intervals make sure you don't overcook it otherwise the the batter will become rubbery so every 10 seconds just give it a little mix [Music] [Music] it started to thicken so this is what we want okay so keep this aside please and the next step is um take your 100 grams of butter and i've used this i've used salted butter and i'm going to add three tablespoons of cocoa powder [Music] and again i'm going to mix this and melt this on in the microwave [Music] 10 seconds at a time you can do this on the stove first melt the butter and then add the cocoa powder and keep stirring [Music] so butter is melted and mix this well get all the lumps out this gives a really nice dark color to your brownies and now we've got one cup of flour here and one cup of sugar this is like a heaped cup [Music] here i have 200 grams of condensed milk [Music] 1 teaspoon of baking powder and half a teaspoon of baking soda [Music] now i want to add all these items in it this is the cocoa powder and the butter [Music] and the gooey part of our brownies the flour and water mixture [Music] and a big pinch of salt and here i have three tablespoons of our fudge sauce this will make this really special and you can if you want add a tablespoon or two of chopped chocolate or chocolate chips is also good now we need to mix this [Music] you can use a beat if you want but you can also do this with your hand [Music] i always like to clean the sides now also add my walnuts [Music] and our mixture is ready sometimes you know the flour gets stuck at the bottom so i like to use [Music] my spatula make sure everything's mixed well okay brownie mixture ready and here i have my cookie dough this is our cookie dough mixture and i will post the recipe down in the description box so i'm just going to add the brownie batter in the tin so take everything out you don't want to waste anything [Music] spread this tap it make sure it's level and we have our cookie dough here which i'm just going to spread on top don't put too much [Music] break this in the oven at 150 degrees [Music] for about 40 minutes and here see i've put the black tray in the middle shelf and take it out and place this in the center [Music] make sure it's baked mode which that means only the bottom grill is working [Music] so our cookie brownies are done [Music] so i'm just going to check it's perfect i'm going to cover these um brownies up until it cools down so just see why i have left the butter paper overlapping so it's easy to lift it and we'll let this cool down and then we'll cut it into squares so here are cookie brownies ready now if you want you can just get some melted chocolate and you can just drizzle a little bit on top if you like [Music] [Music] if you want to sprinkle a few pieces of chocolate chips on top before this dries up just quickly do that that's done [Music] you", "arcVlU4ng3k": "rolling cookies-and-cream I'm ready this week I'm making a mega tape that I've been wanting to make for a long time I'm making a cookies and cream negative you're welcome make the cake I made four pounds of my ultimate vanilla batter then I chopped up some mini Oreos and folded them and came to that batter do you see that right there's already cookies and cream in the cake okay oh my gosh it was so beautiful and you know what's interesting is like cookies and cream is of flavor but let's be honest the only cookie people are using is Oreo Oreo nobody's like oh gee does that have opening swirls in the bun no no you we know what cookie you're talking about it it made three pounds of my chocolate batter and the first thing I need to do is press an Oreo crust down into my cake pan so I mixed together Oreo crumbs sugar butter melted butter press them in the pan and then I poured my chocolate batter over that and baked it all as one okay so this recipe is definitely going on the blog there's no choice this recipe is the blog it's called cookies and cream Escom we're just changing the other recipes are quivering as we speak even simple syrup is work even simple sir [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I'm gonna this this cook is good this cook this cake is cookies and cream like personified it's the embodiment of cookies and creams with a decomposed yeah that's the wrong I mean that's at the same time it's like a deconstructed version of cookies and cream fold it in the Oreo cookies to the vanilla like how did it what did the cake look like like just bits of Oreo and all over yeah bits of little bits of Oreo all over yeah and it was really nice but they didn't and was when you fold heavier things into batter really sinks to the bottom they didn't completely sink so they were speckled within the vanilla cake so now I have all four layers of cake prepared and ready to be simple syrup I'm gonna let the simple syrup soak into my layers and in the meantime I'm going to make some Oreo buttercream so those same crumbs I used to make the crumb crust I'm going to fold them into Italian meringue buttercream this is now the second time in what a very short while that I have intentionally put crumbs in buttercream once I get to the third we're gonna need to do something about me call the assembly I have my Oreo buttercream I have two packs of double stuffed Oreos because I'm not playing that when I cut the cake you'll see them more I still remember when they invented double stuffed it was loud it was an event in your life well yeah I mean now Oreo was like come so far they have like every flavor every but I remember when they invented double size I was like I could have twice do you prefer traditional Oreos or double stuff I think it depends on my mood in this cake I definitely prefer double but if I'm eating an Oreo I do prefer traditional yeah it's the right ratio and then I also have some chocolate ganache that is dyed black because even though Oreos are technically chocolate they're very dark and now I can build this mega cake starting from the bottom the first cake I place down onto my board is the chocolate cake with the Oreo crumb crust so now I spread on some of my Oreo Italian meringue buttercream a nice even layer and I really want to neaten up the sides and make sure that the layer of buttercream is really meet because this is kind of the canvas for where I'm gonna lay it on all the double stuffed Oreos I bet you there are paintings of Oreos guaranteed so I line up the Oreos and this is when I feel like kq4 yeah cuz normally when I do stuff like this in my mind I'm like okay Yolanda except it's not gonna work out perfectly it worked out perfectly with my subconscious knew my subconscious was like the circumference of eleven Oreos in the surface is equal to I have no idea what happened but it worked out and I'm happy now before I have this the next cake layer I want to make sure that that cake layer sticks to the Oreos but I don't want to ice over the Oreos and mess up the pattern so what I'm going to do is put some of my Italian meringue buttercream in a piping bag and pipe little dollops on the surface of each for you now I can carefully add a layer of my vanilla Oreo cake that's what I did right just checking so because this cake is much lighter in color this is where I'm going to spread my black chocolate ganache again nice even layer make sure it's really neat at the sides and then I'm gonna repeat my Oreo like double stuffed Oreo I'm not alternating the cake layers because I want the crumbs to be on the bottom and then at the very top so this time I'm blinked back in with my vanilla Oreo layer here's the problem I need ganache to make sure that that cake layer sticks to the Oreos and once again I didn't want to spread ganache on the Oreos and mess them up I flipped my cake layer over I I spotted it neatly and then I really carefully picked it up and flipped it on to the camera nobody else gets as excited about this is me I'm like oh no you learn if you miss the whole cake lopsided I have this a whole inner dialogue and then when it comes time for interview and I announce it everyone's just like no the anandha that was that flip was incredibly impressive Thank You chocolate thank you again it's your turn now thank you okay and then at the final chocolate cake layer but the crumb side up so you see the metaphor is this yeah it's a metaphor for what an Oreo is because there's a cookie sandwich in the goodness inside so now it's time to crumb coat and chill this glorious cake with more of the I know the beautiful thing is I'm promoting and chillin and I technically I'm protecting the cake from crumbs even though I'm using humming butter thing yeah I don't know what to do and once my crumb coat is chilled I'm going to ice my cake again with this beautiful buttercream I just love the way it looks it reminds me of like concrete like it's it's so beautiful so nice I love the way it looks so I want to ice it I'm gonna use a bench paper to get it as smooth as I can smooth out the top and then I'm gonna put it in the fridge to chill and make some ganache to drip you guys know just look at the camera I'm gonna do that the whole interview guys I'm basically making the exact same chocolate ganache that's on the inside a black chocolate ganache I just have to make the ganache I used for the filling ahead of time so it was spreadable but this ganache I don't want to be spreadable I want it to be drip abaut TripIt bone what you want to do is once the chocolate and cream are ready to be stirred together when there's still a little bit warm that's when you add your food coloring and the reason I'm adding the food coloring to dark chocolate ganache is because I'll need so much less food coloring because it's already done I mean already I've talked about so many of my recipes vanilla cake chocolate cakes simple syrup Italian meringue buttercream ganache and I'm so happy to tell you that right now we are offering a three four week course it's my cake and icing basics program where I walk you through all of these recipes I've just mentioned and more step-by-step what I wanted to do is just answer all of the questions I get over the last five years about my buttercream about simple syrup and why you use it about how to get the perfect batter and I'm just I'm so proud of it I take you through all of my foundations and you get to go through it at your own pace this really is the beginning of being a great make them and it's completely free there's a link below where you can sign up for my free cake and icing basics program so I'm placing this lovely black ganache into a parchment paper piping bag and what you want to do is hold the tip right at the top corner of your cake just slightly over the top okay Jocelyn's favorite item a parchment paper piping bag and how you create the drip is you start to squeeze the more you squeeze the more your drip will drip down the cake you squeeze and you move because you just don't want one big blob and once that's done you squeeze out the rest of your ganache onto the top center of the cake and then use a small offset spatula to really spread it nice and smooth and bring it out to meet that four door you created I want this ganache drip to set before I decorate the top so I'm gonna put it in the fridge to chill and in the meantime I'm gonna take some Oreos up a notch exactly this is the question I asked I studied I meditated on it and so what I've decided is to melt some pink chocolate wafers and then I have one of our sprinkle blends and what I'm gonna do is dip Oreo by Oreo half wait you know what's great about dipping an Oreo half way I'm going to tell you I didn't mark each Oreo and make up a mark but because they say Oreo in the middle you can use that like always dip to the same letter you see and before the chocolate sets sprinkle on your sprinkles [Music] okay I love sprinkles because they're a noun and a verb it tells you like what they are and how to apply them you know Amy I've put more of my Italian meringue buttercream my Oreo meta metallian know I've always wanted to go to Middle East you are the worst this is do we have time for a cake confession this is the worst thing cuz often what I'm talking about oh really just cut off or changes cut yeah right you notice that the minute I was going to pour out my feelings changes took the camera off we're now going to pipe mounds of buttercream on top of my cake right on top of that black chocolate ganache when I piped my mouth I like to think about my cake I like the face of a cloth so I'll pipe like 12 o'clock 6 o'clock 3 o'clock 9 o'clock and then pipe in between oh my gosh have you seen I think there's some app it allows you to take a picture of yourself and then it shows you what you'd look like if you were perfectly symmetrical Oh weird depressing so somebody did it to like a bunch of celebrities and what they look works yeah it looks weird like you instantly recognize there's something wrong with their face when technically their face has been corrected to be perfectly symmetrical ok and off-topic so it back to Oreos so I piped the mounds I'm really happy with the way they look and what I want to do is position my beautifully dipped double stuffed Oreos between those bounds and I want the pink dipped part to sort of stick out so I'm going to sandwich the non dipped part between the mouths a Willie I really just love us it doesn't read as a mega cake to me because normally when I make a mega cake like I'm trying to make a statement on the top so now I'm gonna just pile Oreos on the top I'm gonna yeah I'm gonna pile Oreos on top you can use a little bit of the black ganache to help sandwich sandwich I'm sandwich and sandwich I'm sandwich and sandwich cookies its sandwich cookie ception so I'm just making uneven I'm so proud of myself I'm even piles of Oreos in the middle and then I'm going to dress them up with some mini Oreos [Music] [Applause] when I make making cakes this is when I'm like I can't wait to cut it into this yeah mainly cuz I just wanted to see like that the Oreo State in place and the comment and they do the Isaac hey oh we almost had an embarrassing chocolate peanut butter moment here like I was drooling really yeah it was just so good would you choose cookies and cream Network chocolate and peanut butter no I'd choose cookies and cream really yeah it was just so good can't get enough cake check this out here's my cake confession often when I'm sitting here telling you guys how I made a cake I've already made that cake but I'm in the middle of making a different cake and the cake I'm making now is stressing me out and I'm just thinking about what a lovely time I had making this cookies and cream cake I'm

and hot fudge oh my gosh you guys know I need vanilla ice with everything but that is it so easy I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you so much for watching and don't forget to check out my other cookie bar videos later [Music]", "AyeirzHERpE": "hey guys I'm Nick and on this episode of the scram line I'm going to show you guys how to make these you know what I don't know what to actually call these because there's so many things happening in this cupcake so it's like a brownie layer with two chopped mint Oreos in the center baked in there and then there's like cookies and cream and peppermint buttercream frosting like an ombre of that on top so let's call it a peppermint cookies and cream brownie cupcake I think that does it just this okay let's get stuck into the recipe now that I figured that out let's get stuck into the recipe okay guys so we're going to start off by melting the chocolate in the microwave 20 seconds at a time mixing each time until it's smooth then you want to pop that into a bowl and add some melted butter now if you want to do this the sensible way which is what I should have done in the first place just pop the butter and chocolate in a bowl together in the microwave and melt next we're gonna add our eggs sugar cocoa powder and then our flour so whisking each time [Music] you want to add about a tablespoon of that into some cupcake liners now I'm gonna pop about two chocolate peppermint Oreos into each cupcake liner then I'm gonna fill these up again with some more batter you wanna fill them up just below all the way over top you want to bake these on 160 degrees Celsius for about 45 minutes it could take up to an hour depending on the strength of your oven then you want to let them cool down completely now I'm gonna crush some more of those Oreos in the food processor we're gonna add those to some Swiss meringue buttercream frosting I'm gonna add a little bit of peppermint essence in there as well we're gonna mix that until everything is well combined now I split my butter into three bowls in One Bowl I'm gonna add some green mint through gel mix that until everything is well combined in this second Bowl I'm gonna add some more mint green and some blue and mix that until everything is well combined then in the third Bowl we're gonna leave that white now I actually have three open star piping tips which makes this process very easy but if you don't you can just start with the darkest mint green on the bottom clean or replace the piping bag go with the light mint and then finish with the white I'm going to finish these with a good sprinkle of crushed Oreos and guys that is pretty much it okay guys so those were my chocolate peppermint brownie cookies and cream cupcakes I don't even think that's what actually called it in the beginning of this video I'll go back at the beginning while I'm editing and I'll put the proper name in now if you liked this video make sure you hit the like button it lets

I'll see you all on a next episode the scram line", "SHzeHBkTmYI": "[Music] hi everybody welcome back to the cupcake gemma channel and to the crumbs and doilies kitchen here in london where sam and i are filming this on possibly the hottest day of the year so far which is not ideal baking weather but it's okay i've got a recipe for you guys which is pretty simple it's a one tin wonder and it is for a cheesecake brownie so we're going to put it all into the oven at once there's not too much faffing around we're gonna cool it down in the fridge so we're gonna eat it when it's cold which is kind of better than eating hot in this weather i don't know anyway it's delicious it's one of my favorite brownies ever so the first thing we need to do is talk about our tin now if you have got a tin that has got a loose bottom like this then lucky you because that makes it a lot easier to get this kind of cake out of your tin but if not what you need to do is when you're lining it with grease greaseproof which we're going to do anyway is make sure that your greaseproof is nice and long so it's going to cover the bottom and the sides of your tin which means when we come to take it out we can pull it out like this and it's just going to make it so much easier so grab yourself some cake spray or a bit of oil and butter and liberally spray the tin like so just to make sure that your paper is going to stick down and i actually like to do two long pieces i mean you could just cut a short piece here in a short piece here but just to make sure it's nice and easy to get out at the other end i like to do the double long bit i hope that makes sense right so once your tin is lined we can get on with making the brownie part of our cheesecake brownie so let's put those to one side and first of all what we need to do is melt together some chocolate and some butter now as usual i'll give you a few size options in the description box below so i won't give you any um quantities as we go and because i'm doing a large one i'm doing a 10 inch brownie so even quantities of butter it's unsalted as usual and dark chocolate i always like to use as dark as you can go with a 70 if you can find one because it just is really lovely and intense in this brownie so i'm just going to pop over to the microwave melt this down 30 seconds at a time until it all comes together as one lovely chocolate buttery liquid [Music] now you need to try and resist the urge to grab a straw and flirt this up because it just smells so good we're just going to leave it to the side just to cool down a little bit it doesn't need to be cold but we'll just let it cool a tinty bit once we get on with whisking up some sugar and some eggs so castor sugar going in there if you've only got granulated sugar that's absolutely fine and now we're also going to add three eggs so as usual cracking them into a separate bowl so that we don't get any shell into our mixture we're going to pop those in with our sugar and as you can see i've got my balloon whisk on my stand mixer but you can do this with a hand whisk as well and we're going to turn the speed up nice and high and get it whipping okay look how fluffy this is so we mixed this for about three to four minutes and you can see it's gone very very pale in color and it's frothy and it's thick and it looks awesome and this is really really important do not skip that stage out just spend a little time don't be too impatient let it get to the stage it's going to really help with that delicious gooey texture of your brownie so now we're gonna grab back our melted chocolate and butter and we're gonna pour all of this in and first of all we're going to mix that on a low speed just to combine it and now we're going to add some dry ingredients so we've got some plain flour going in along with some cocoa powder a lot of recipes don't add cocoa powder they just stick with the melted chocolate but this really intensifies the chocolatiness and it also brings out a fudgy texture as well so cocoa powder going in the top there finally some baking powder just about half teaspoon of that just to give it a little bit of lift in there we don't want it to be too cakey but just a bit of air is nice and then half a teaspoon of salt as usual to bring out our lovely chocolatey flavors and then back on with the mixer on a low speed until it's fully combined [Music] now we can stop the mixer and the chances are you've probably got a little bit of flour stuck in the whisk there around the sides of the bowl that is a-okay so what we're going to do is just before we take it out just give it a little scrape around just to make sure we haven't left any bits out and now we're going to put it into our tin but we're going to save back a nice healthy spoonful because this is what we're going to use to do our swirly whirlies on top of the cheesecake and the rest of it can go into your tin and you can see it's so thick and gooey and delicious and next you need to grab yourself an offset palette knife like so if you don't have one then just use the back of your spatula or a spoon and we're going to level it out [Music] and now we're not going to bake this just yet we're actually going to get on with making the cheesecake layer because like i said they're going to all go into the oven at once but we're going to need back our mixer and our whisk so just give me a second and i'll get cleaned up and then we can get cheesecaking [Music] and now it is cheesecake time and it's a very very simple recipe it's going to go all into this bowl so starting with loads of cream cheese which is obviously the main ingredient for a cheesecake now i always like to use it at room temperature so just take it out of the fridge like half an hour or so before you're going to use it and then we're going to add in some caster sugar next up we've got two large free range eggs and they're gonna go straight in the bowl and finally some vanilla you don't need to do this or do you know what you could put in some lemon zest or something if you wanted a little bit more tang in there but i'm gonna go with a half teaspoon of this lovely vanilla which is the exact vanilla that we use here in the bakery and at soho and you can get yourself some of this over at cupcakegemma.com and we're gonna pop that onto the mixer and we're gonna whip it up with the balloon whisk again for about four to five minutes and it's gonna start by going very liquidy then it's gonna thicken and that's what we want i'll show you when we get [Music] there [Music] look at it if you know anything about me you'll know that cheesecake is my all-time favorite thing in the entire world i could dive in there right now but i won't right so what we'll do is put all of this on top of our brownie and spread it out [Music] um and now all that's left to do is put the brownie swirls through it so we need to put our brownie mixture that we saved back on top of this but as you can see it's very thick and very stiff and that's going to be really hard to swell through the lovely soft cheesecake so here is my top tip get yourself some hot water boiled water and just put a little spoonful at a time into your brownie batter and stir it through and that's just going to kind of liquify i don't know what that word is make it easier to swirl through the cheesecake loosen it up thanks rosie and once you've mixed it all through it'll be a lot looser like so very similar to the texture of the cheesecake which means it'll swirl together very easily so what we're gonna do is put some blobs on top of the cheesecake and now for swirling you want to use something like a skewer like so something kind of thin and pointy is perfect and we're going to swirl the two together [Music] and it looks so pretty and it's so easy this is one of those things that you think like how do people do that but it is that simple guys so now off to the oven it's preheated at 170 degrees c that's with a fan and we're gonna put it in for about 30 to 35 minutes so to test that it's done it's going to look a little bit jiggly that is fine it's a cheesecake that's what they do but you want to insert the skewer and if it comes out with a little bit of brownie batter on it perfect if it's got a little bit too much batter and a bit of cheesecake on there as well put it in for another minute at a time until it's baked all the way through [Music] okay guys so once your brownie is out of the oven you then need to cool it down completely so leave it out for about half an hour and then you can put it into the fridge to set and cool completely and you can also leave it in the fridge to store it as well and it looks amazing and i can't wait to eat it i've made a huge one for no reason other than for the fact that i really like it so let me cut it inside and we'll have a look [Music] look how good it is you can see that fudgy fudgy brownie topped with a really fluffy perfectly baked cheesecake and i've just got myself a fork because like i said it's all mine it is absolutely delicious and the two textures are really great together because you get a bit of a bite from the brownie and then the melty fluffiness from the cheesecake and it's got that tang from the intensity from the chocolate this is a winning combination guys it is i mean i don't really know what else to say because i just all i want to do is eat it right now but alas carry on with the video so please have a go at this let us know as usual how you get on over on instagram where you can see what we're all up to as well and all these exciting developments that we've got going on at crumbs and doilies and cupcake demo and also make sure to head over to cupcakedemo.com because we've got some of the tools i used in the video like the offset palette knife which is my favorite tool and of course the vanilla extract as well so head over there get yourself some treats and when it cools down we can get baking again so i'm going to switch the oven off and jump into a fridge and i'm going to take my cheesecake brownie with me and basically have a lovely afternoon so we'll see you guys soon [Music] you", "X9v_kYWIVzQ": "[Music] [Music] um [Music] surprised [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] brownie um foreign you", "JSE6P6hD0rM": "hey guys today we're making this\ndelicious selection of brownies these are perfect to bring to work to school to a\nparty or even for bake sale and because Valentine's Day is just around the\ncorner nothing says I love you like a custom brownie box I'm going to show you\ntoday how to make one simple brownie batter and then transform it into\ndifferent brownies okay so we're going to start by making the doughs or batters\nwhich are going to go on top of the brownie batter the first we're making is\nthe chocolate chip cookie dough which will make cookie brownies these are\namazing the gooey fudgy brownie with the crispy cookie topping makes for the most\nincredible combination so I melted butter I've added the sugar milk and\nvanilla today we're using white sugar as brown sugar Browns to fast there's also\nno eggs and you'll notice that once you mix in the dry ingredients this dough\nwill have more of a batter consistency if you're new to my channel welcome make\nsure to subscribe and click that notification bell I post new videos\nevery week mix in the chocolate chips I like to save some for the top and you're\ngoing to set this to the side moving on we're going to make the Cheesecake\nbatter to make cheesecake brownies if you love creamy rich almost custard like\ndesserts these aren't the rowdies for you so myself and cream cheese I've\nadded vanilla sugar and flour and you'll also need a bit of egg whites as an\nadditional binder please don't open an egg just to use one tablespoon of egg\nwhites okay take it from the eggs you'll be using for the brownie batter if you\ncheck the description box you'll understand what I mean everything is\nwritten there okay so the third batter we're going to make is the peanut butter\none you cannot go wrong with peanut butter and chocolate it's such a classic\ndelicious combination so myself and peanut butter I've added sugar and flour\nthat's all you need can also top the brownies with peanuts and caramel and\nboom you have Snickers brownies okay so I'll do making the actual\nbrownies this is my fudge brownie recipe which so many of you love if you have\nnot tried that recipe you have to try it they're amazing delicious I've gone\nahead and melted in the microwave the butter and chocolate together making\nsure to stir this mixture every 40 seconds\nyou can also do this over a double boiler and I do like to remove it from\nthe microwave or you know the stove before it's fully melted as you continue\nto stir it the residual heat will melt the last pieces of chocolate add the\nsugar coffee and eggs you will not taste the coffee but it does enhance the\nflavour of the chocolates now let's talk about this brownie box there's so many\nmore flavors I wanted to include the ones I'm showing you are probably the\nmost classic and the most delicious however get creative if you have some\nNutella some strawberry jam lying around in your fridge or maybe some Oreos use\nwhatever you like whatever you have or prefer I've added the dry ingredients\nand this batter is ready to be poured in to 7-inch pins or you can use one large\nbaking dish this brownie batter is quite thick as you can see so make sure you\nspread it out as evenly as you can now with the first brownie pan we're going\nto make chocolate chip cookie brownies and double chocolate brownies as you can\nsee the cookie batter will have become more of a dough consistency at this\npoint I like to just scatter the dough on top there's no right way to do this\nand then scatter some more chocolate chips on top now I'm using chocolate\nchips for the double chocolate brownies as well it's just more convenient to use\nthe same thing but you could also add some roughly chopped chocolate on top\nset is to the side and we're going to make the cream eat brownies I do like to\nput the Cheesecake batter in a piping bag it's just easier and faster but you\ncould also use just a spoon and you want to swirl it around using a toothpick or\na knife the peanut butter dough will be quite thick so you just want to dollop\nit on top using your hands or a spoon and again you want to swirl it into the\nbrownie batter using a spoon or a toothpick\nnow you would stop here if you want a creamy peanut butter brownie however I\nwant some crunch with my peanut butter brownies so I'm going to be adding some\nsalted peanuts on top and I highly recommend you add some salted peanuts on\ntop it makes these you know amazing okay so now let's talk about baking time this\nis important you're going to bake the brownies in a preheated oven at 180\ndegrees Celsius or 350 Fahrenheit for around 30 minutes if you should see\nthat the top starts to brown too much what you can do is cover the brownies\nwith some aluminum foil I did end up doing that for the cookie brownies it\nreally depends on your oven so just keep an eye on the brownies you'll know\nthey're ready when the toothpick comes out with Gili crumbs if you want to see\na proper toothpick test just check my other brownie video to get a good look\nat the toothpicks allow the brownies to cool for 20 minutes in the pan and then\ntake them out to finish cooling to get a clean cut or semi-clean allow the\nbrownies to go completely and use a hot knife now call me crazy but I do not\nlike brownie edges I love a creamy rich brownie so I do cut the edges put these\non a tray or a box and whoever you're going to be serving these to they're\ngoing to be wowed these are incredibly delicious\nthere's the flavor and texture for everybody and you just cannot go wrong\nwith a good chocolaty fudgy brownie  ", "rNGecDtl9hs": "hey everyone it's Ryan and today I'm going to show you how to make cookies and cream brownie cheesecake bars these bars taste absolutely

brownie mix mostly brownie mix have two eggs instructions but i'm using three eggs because um i don't want to make my brownie so fudgy and i want it to be fluffy so the eggs will make it fluffier and softer and it will be able to absorb more cream in it and it's going to be more softer [Music] so after uh when i'm done beating my egg that level is not beating so the girls will be eating they really love baking a lot so i use butter 1 3 cup i like my brownie rich with cream and butter so after that i'm going to use one third of one third cup of heavy cream and then i use just brownie mix [Music] hello [Music] do if the mixture is still thick you can put some cream heavy cream i like to use heavy cream instead of milk but you can use milk water whatever you're suitable for you and then it's just mixing process all over again until it becomes really creamy and soft and all the small pieces in there just melts in it then you have to bake it at on the temperature of 350 for because my pan is bigger so i baked it around for 25 minutes but it's all depend upon your pan and it will stay on the back of the brownie mix and then i i crushed some oreo cookies about it was one packet and

taco but if you like one and a half cup half cup is the recipe required half cup but i use one third cup because i don't like too much sugar [Music] make sure it's really thick and when it's really thick and stiff it will not fall from your beater and then we're gonna add cream cheese approximately eight ounces [Music] and i'm gonna beat it again [Music] now i'm gonna add the cookies uh the crushed cookies in the mixture and if you like you can separate the cookies and the cream from it and then you can crush the cookies and then add that it will be easy for you and i forgot actually i

Is it soft and cakey and crumby, or is it dense and chewy and fudgy? Whichever it is, we've got the recipe for you Even if you picked the first one, we won't judge you for it. Let's get down to Basics. [Music] So first up we'll address the cake in the room, the cakey brownies. Courtesy of a recipe from King Arthur Flour. Into the bowl of a stand mixer goes: -About 2 1/2 cups of sugar along with -1 cup or 2 sticks of unsalted butter at room temperature Which we are going to cream together using the paddle attachment. Once a light, fluffy consistency has been reached, we're going to combine some dry ingredients in a small bowl. 1 and a quarter cups of cocoa powder and a teaspoon of kosher salt and a teaspoon of baking powder, which we're going to tiny whisk together before adding to the bowl. And mixing together tentatively, while we prepare our dry ingredients- I mean eggs. For this recipe, we're going with four large eggs plus one large egg white. Which we're going to add to the bowl while our mixer mixes one at a time Making sure it's fully incorporated before adding the next egg. We're also going to add a half of cup of water. Beat that on high speed until it is nice and creamy and then, for the final ingredient, some flour. One and a half cups of all-purpose added and mixed minimally so as not to develop too much gluten. This same sort of methodology you might employ while making pancakes. Just give that a few cursory folds make sure that everybody is nice and incorporated and then we're going to prepare our brownie pan I like to rub the whole thing down with vegetable oil and then line with parchment paper And then we are dumping in and spreading evenly our brownie batter, which we are then going to place in a 350 degree Fahrenheit oven for 25 to 30 minutes until it resembles a cake, like this one and a toothpick, when inserted off-center emerges cleanly over the few, dainty, moist crumbs, still clinging to its wooden shaft. Then, by the parchment paper, we are removing the brownies from the brownie pan, and allowing to cool completely on a wire rack for at least one hour. Just enough time to make the only thing that makes cakey brownies worth eating, frosting. Into the bowl of a stand mixer goes one stick of soft butter, two and a half cups of sifted powder sugar, half a cup of cocoa powder, and just enough milk to make things spreadable between 1/3 to 2/3 cups. Cream that on high speed for about one minute until finger-licking delicious. Once the brownies have complete cooled we're going to remove them from the parchment paper and frost them liberally, so that the recipients of our brownies do not die of thirst and, since we're going this far we might as well... throw some sprinkles on there. Rainbow colored only because chocolate would just be redundant and then you better head down to the break room because it's Karen's birthday and you only get cake if you sing HR's birthday bylaws are perspicuous and very strict. Now, for all my trash talking this is actually a pretty damn good brownie even by cake standards. It's still very moist and has a nice density, I'm trying to catch my paper plate on fire, it's not work- there we go. But if you couldn't tell already, I'm more of the chewy, fudgy brownie type. For this, we turn to America's Test Kitchen, who recommends lining a brownie pan with aluminum foil, and lubricating with non-stick spray. Not quite sure how I feel about this, but let's give it a shot. Go ahead and set that aside so into a large bowl we can combine: 1/3 of 1 cup of cocoa powder, 1 1/2 teaspoons of espresso powder. As I have mentioned before, this won't make it taste like coffee, it's just gonna amp up the chocolate flavor. As will 2 ounces of unsweetened, chopped chocolate. To which we're going to add 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons of boiling water Whisking until completely melted and incorporated. Then while it's still warm, We're adding 4 tablespoons of butter, letting that melt, And then, an essential element to chewy brownies is oil in this case, 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil. Additionally, the ratio of eggs that we use: In this case, 2 large eggs plus 2 egg yolks. By this point, the mixture should have cooled significantly so go ahead and throw the eggs in there and whisk to combine. We're also going to add 1 teaspoon and 1/2 of vanilla extract. Come on little guy, let's go. Teaspoon and a half of vanilla extract You can also add a teaspoon of espresso powder if desired. We're going to whisk that together before adding Two and one half cups of granulated sugar, preferably to a slightly larger bowl, am I right? Last but not least, once that's fully incorporated we are adding the flour One and three quarter cups of All Purpose, you can mix this a bit more thoroughly than the previous batch because we're not trying to get the same tenderness that we would in a cakey brownie Actually last but not least, 6 ounces of chopped bittersweet chocolate, whole and melted chocolate is essential for a fudgy brownie Mix that until just combined, go ahead and pour into our prepared 9x13 brownie pan, and we're dropping this guy into a similarly preheated 350 degree Fahrenheit oven for 30 to 35 minutes until a tester emerges virtually unscathed but with a little bit of goo still hanging to it Then after allowing to cool one hour in the pan we are removing by virtue of the foil and this is the only step that I didn't understand because there was significant stickage to the foil despite all the non stick spray that was used, which as always been my experience in brownie making so if you ask me, stick with the parchment paper Once we managed to get that out of there, as you can see I've caused some significant damage to the surface integrity But that doesn't stop this from being a majorly delicious fudgy brownie with a truffle-like texture and a subtle chew and while you will most certainly eat these brownies in a single bite like what I'm doing here What if you're like me and you like your brownies practically melting and with the texture of chewing gum, well I got the recipe for you Please bear in mind when we filmed this, I only made a half batch so I'm going to narrate the correct amounts and you can just follow along with the video for a visual reference, into a large bowl goes one and three quarter cups or sugar, two sticks of melted butter I'm also going to add a teaspoon and a half of espresso powder One teaspoon of vanilla extract and four eggs plus two egg yolks Go ahead and give those a whisk and to combine completely before adding one cup of cocoa powder and half a cup of vegetable oil I'm sorry I'm putting weird emphases in my sentences, I'm having a long night; whisk that fairly to combine and then it's time to add my secret weapon: bread flour. In addition to all the other chew-inducing elements that we have in this recipe bread flour is high in gluten and will create a chewier texture before we add it we are whisking it together with a teaspoon each of baking powder and kosher salt and we are chopping six ounces of bittersweet chocolate that we are going to add to the mix before adding the flour, then we are going to fold the whole thing together. But again don't worry about over-mixing The more you mix the more gluten you develop. And La-Di-Da the chewier your brownie. This time I'm returning to the greased pan with parchment paper lining, this might not encourage the same glossy exterior you get with aluminum foil but I  just think it makes it easier to get out of the pan, and as you can see my brownie battered doubles as I poured it into the pan because I made another batch Anywho, this guys going to the same 350 degree Fahrenheit oven for 25-35 minutes until your degree of doneness has been acheived, and I like mine somewhere between barely cooked and not cooked, it's like the Levain cookie of brownies, I love it, anyway I hope this gives you some ideas on how to give up the boxed stuff and improve the brownies in your life Because whether you like your brownies cakey, or fudgy or chewie or other; you deserve your shot at happiness and happiness is a brownie Hey guys, Brownies.. Hey folks, Brownies... Brownies... For you and for me, for America For the world.. really, uh.. Brownies.. Hey folks, brownies When I say that word, which of Lord of the Rings movies do you think of?

[Laughs]", "otWzFXqqVJQ": "hello and welcome back to a recipe land on my channel and thank you very much for letting me have a bit of time off I feel very rested and peaceful and I have lots of exciting recipes to show you so starting with this one this is a recipe for Rick EADS now if you haven't heard of these these are something I discovered on Pinterest like weeks or maybe months ago I saw a picture of them and I was like I need tomatoes it's basically a cookie and a brownie mix together and it makes a bricky obviously so this recipe is and something I had a little tinker around with some of my own brownie recipes on my own cookie recipes to see which ones work together best and I have come up with a real corker for you so I'm going to start with making the cookie dough it's a bit different to some of the cookie dough's I've made before in the past it's really easy though you basically dup all the ingredients in mix it all together add some chocolate chips mix up going start with some plain flour and I have some soft light brown sugar where you can use like Muscovado sugar and also some castor sugar and I have to stop unsalted butter as well and I've got one large egg and the yolk of another egg and then I also have and then mix that all together on a medium speed until if this comes together like a dough and now that it's all come together I'm going to add the last reading which is 100 grams of chocolate chips I'm using a 50% cocoa solids so that it's not too bitter but you can just use any job with it [Music] once that's orally combined it is ready so what we're going to do with this is not to bake it like a cookie because the speeds defeating the point we are going to make little balls of the dough and freezes and what that's going to do is not allow them to cook them you can put them in the brownie later they'll stay a little bit under base which is absolutely perfect so it should be nice and soft and go light but quite sticky is I need some spoons you can do it with your hands but it's really mega sticky little bit very messy I'm just going to scoop up kind of worn outside the mouth I like that I just pop them on a baking tray ready for the freezer waste not want not [Music] okay so they're ready to go in the freezer and you need to freeze those for at least a couple of hours until they're nice and hot now it's time to make the brownie part of this recipe and I'm going to start with melting some butter and chocolate together I've got some chopped unsalted butter here which is nice and cold and also some dark chocolate so at this chocolate is 70% cocoa solids and they just go in and I mix them all together until it's toasty melted basically I love throwing and that is why was also my favorite things and whole world cook candy all the stirring happens business also that is perfect very much chocolate and my butter is melted and I need to wait until that cooled down a little bit so it's fine to be getting on with the next bit and that is beating eggs and sugar together so I've got three large free-range eggs and some castor sugar and I just I'm going to beat that together on medium to high speed for about three to five minutes until it's really whippy and pale so stop and leave it isn't working right so now this is all lovely and witty and voluminous I'm going to add the chocolate and butter mixture it's now quite cool it's kind of like body heat which is just right so I'm going to cook the eggs and I'm just going to pour that in while this machine still going now that's all in you can just go right ahead and turn that off and put your dry ingredients in so I'm just going to take this tablet otherwise it's going to get really annoying so I'm going to sieve all the ingredients directly into the bowl with my chakra few fingers I've got some plain flour and some cocoa powder and some baking powder and salt and I just need to shuffle that through these if sometimes it needs a bit of help I'm going to bring my paddle back on because this now needs to be folded gently you can do it by hand but I like to let the mixer do it that's on a low speed so it should look thick and sticky and dark like you just want to put your face into it which is perfect and now it's time to put it into the kids well I'm using a ten inch square Tim and I have lined it and greased it just line it with baking paper and I'm just going to dump all of it [Music] like I said it's mega sticky so it will need a little bit of leveling out so we're going to use a crank pallet knife it up and now I've got it's nice and a level it's time to put my frozen cookie dough balls into this thing I you might not need them all that is quite a lot but don't worry if you're kind of over during your brownie but really like the more the merrier so just dot them about and stick them right in and if there's some holes that you want to fill just break off little smaller pieces and kind of poke them in the middle [Music] great and now I'm going to bake this at a hundred eighty degrees feed for around 20 to 22 minutes you don't want to make it cooked all the way through it needs to have a little bit of softness in the middle cause that's how good brownies are made it's come out of the oven and it smells so good but I'm going to have to wait until it has cooled down completely before I cut into it it's cool it's ready for me I'm ready for it I've got my big fat knife and I am going to see what's happening oh yeah that is gonna be so tasty because that cookie dough is just a little bit on the bait which is going to make it chewy yummy and cookie dough II oh now it's tasting time and it's going to cut a little sliver off I think if I start I won't be able to stop my god it's so foggy and chewy and chocolatey so chocolatey like oh so my shop button in here that is well known well I'm pretty excited about having made that so hopefully you're going to give it a go Sophie to the description box has all the measurements for this recipe so check that out and give it the thumbs up if you liked it and let me know how you got on as well in the comments box below I'm very excited I'm going to have to have some help using this so hopefully far you're going to help me yes please great but something I are going to eat this brownie just between us too so don't judge oh and I will be back soon with another recipe and until then happy baking yeah [Music]", "8aTy19eR_QM": "[Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "8-48uoAdyIk": "hi my name is Lauren liling from keep it sweet desserts today I'm going to show you how to make cookies and cream brownies with cream cheese icing the first thing we're going to do is melt our chocolate and butter and then once we've done that we're going to add all the rest of the ingredients for this recipe you'll need just 4 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate a half a cup of sugar 1 egg 1 teaspoon of vanilla and a half a cup of flour and then we're going to add our cookies we're going to use about three quarters of a cup of chocolate sandwich cookies so i'll put my chocolate my butter in the pot you want to use a medium sized heavy duty saucepan and we're going to melt the chocolate and butter over medium heat it should just take a few minutes on your stove what I love about homemade brownies is just how easy they are to make you don't need a box mix these are delicious so once your butter and chocolate is melted we're going to add our sugar and just stir it in until it's combined with the chocolate and butter

you're ready to go just slice them into 12 pieces and serve they're delicious I'm Lauren liling come visit me at keep it sweet desserts for more sweets and lots of recipes", "2Hw2pkJvdY0": "(upbeat music) - Hey everyone, it's Natasha\nof natashaskitchen.com and today I'm gonna teach you how to make the best brownies you'll\nsink your teeth into. Stay tuned 'cause we're\nsharing our best tips for moist fudgy brownies. You'll impress everyone. Let's get started. (hands tap) We'll start with some quick prep. Preheat your oven to\n350 degrees Fahrenheit. Then butter and line a nine\nby nine inch baking pan. Lining with parchment paper\nwill make it so much easier to remove the brownies from the pan later. Now place a medium saucepan over low heat and melt in two sticks or 16\ntablespoons of unsalted butter with two cups of\nsemi-sweet chocolate chips. Reserve the remaining one\nhalf cup of chocolate chips for later. Continue stirring until\neverything is melted together and completely smooth. Then take that chocolate\nsauce off the heat and let it cool for 15 minutes. You'll want that mixture to\nbe just warm and not hot. Now in a large mixing\nbowl, add four large eggs, and these can be chilled\nright out of the refrigerator. No need to bring them to room temperature. Add one and a fourth\ncups of granulated sugar. Here's the secret ingredient, add one tablespoon of\ninstant coffee granules. You can't taste the coffee, but it really amps up the\nflavor of the chocolate. Now add three tablespoons of oil and one tablespoon of vanilla extract. Whisk that together until\nit's really well combined. Now our chocolate mixture has been cooling for about 15 minutes\nand it's no longer hot so we're going to pour\nthe chocolate mixture into the egg mixture. Now I do set a timer for\nthis chocolate mixture. You want to make sure it's not too hot and also not too cold or it\nwill be difficult to blend in. Now whisk those together\nuntil the mixture is smooth and well combined. Oh yeah, this is getting good, but it's just gonna get\nbetter so stay tuned. In a second medium bowl,\nwhisk together two thirds cup of all purpose flour, one half cup of unsweetened cocoa powder, one and a half teaspoons of baking powder, and half a teaspoon of salt. Whisk those together thoroughly, then add the dry ingredients\nto your chocolate mixture. Now I know there's not a\nton of flour in this recipe, but the results are incredibly fudgy and the texture will amaze you. Use a spatula to fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients\nuntil it's completely smooth and you don't see any streaks of cocoa, then stop mixing because\nyou don't want to over-mix this batter. Once the dry ingredients\nare fully incorporated, transfer that to your prepared pan. The batter will be thick and\nlook like chocolate lava. Oh, I could look at this all day. Once you've scraped out every last drop of that delicious batter,\nlightly smooth out the top. Now we'll need that one half cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips\nthat we reserved earlier. You can skip the chocolate chips on top if you want to cut down the sugar a bit, but keep in mind these brownies don't have any kind of glaze or frosting so adding the chocolate\nchips is a nice way to decorate the top. It's just an easy way\nto make this look fancy. Once the chocolate chips are on, gently pat them down with your hand. Now we're gonna bake these\nat 350 degrees Fahrenheit on the center rack for 35 to 40 minutes. At 35 minutes, you'll have\na super fudgy brownie, at 40 minutes you'll still\nhave a very moist brownie. I like them right in\nbetween at 37 minutes. And when you poke a\ntoothpick into the center of the brownies, it'll\ncome out with a little bit of moist crumbs attached. The most important thing to\nremember for fudgy brownies is do not over-bake. Once these are out of the oven, let them cool in the pan until they're nearly at room temperature, giving those fudgy centers time to cool will make them much easier to slice later. All right, it is time for the taste test. I've been patient enough. It's still warm, but\nwe're just gonna do this 'cause I want my brownies. (laughs) Okay, first of all, loosen up the edges that don't have parchment paper, just so it comes out easier. You can use a little knife or a spatula. Okay, now watch how\neasy this is to remove. Remember we lined it with parchment paper? Check this out. Boom (laughs). I like to take it out before slicing, that way I don't destroy\nmy pan and scratch it up. Look at that. Isn't that gorgeous? It is, admit it. (laughs) Oh, okay. And the trick to a clean cut in a brownie is to wipe the knife with a paper towel just like you would with\na cake or a cheesecake with every slice, okay? And then also you'll get a cleaner cut if you let it cool down\nto room temperature. Okay, so here we go, 'cause\nI cannot wait any longer. (laughs) We're going to make big slices because we like to be\ngenerous with our brownies. Oh yeah. Things are gettin' real. (laughs) Okay, look at this. So fudgy and moist and decadent and just completely delicious! Oh my goodness. We're gonna plate this. If you like a drier brownie, which I don't know anyone that does, but you can bake it a\nlittle longer (laughs). Oh! We forgot the ice cream\nand we need ice cream, I'll be right back. All right (laughs). Is there anybody else that totally loves a brand new tub of ice cream? Oh, it just scoops so easily. It's like this velvety texture. Here we go. All right, here we go. This is the moment I\nhave been waiting for. I like serving the ice\ncream right over the top. And if it's still a little bit warm, the ice cream starts to\nmelt over the brownie. (laughs) Just like it's doing right now! (laughs) Yum. Okay, here we go. Get a little bit of both. Ice cream just has a way\nof balancing a brownie. (laughs) This is an excuse to\neat ice cream, I guess. Mm, okay. Hmm. Wow. That is decadent. So fudgy. So chocolatey without being overly sweet. And absolutely that ice cream\ncuts through the brownie in just the right way. It is a match made in heaven (laughs). So good. The other thing I love\nabout these brownies is they stay really soft for\ndays after they're baked. So delicious, they don't get dry. They are just wonderful. And I love how that coffee\nreally amps up the flavor of the chocolate. You can't taste it in there,\nbut it is so delicious. And there's two youngsters\nthat really want to get in on this taste test, so\nlet's get 'em over here. Come on guys! Come on, come on! All right, here's your forks. (laughs) Of course she made a surprise entry. Here, let me get you some. Boom! Try that. What do you think? What do\nyou think, what do you think? Do I get the two thumbs? Do I get the two thumbs? How's it taste? Whoo! (laughs) You like it?\n- Mom, I want my own brownie. - Okay, you can have your own brownie. I got a whole bunch of brownies (laughs). And that's a wrap. Oop, oop.\n(plate clatters) Sorry.\n(plate clatters) She wants her own brownie. Okay (laughs). - Big piece! - Big piece?\n(knife clatters) Which one's the big piece? They're all big. Okay, this one. - I'll also have a big piece. - Which one? That one? Okay. All right.\n- I'd like some more ice cream on top. - These are gonna disappear fast. Always. But you'll be happy if you have leftovers. I'm telling you they're\njust as good the next day. Okay, big scoops, that's\nwhat I'm talkin' about. I hope you guys enjoy this video and we'll see you next time.

far the most interesting we're making red velvet cheesecake brownies let's get started so i'm going to start by creaming one cup of salted softened butter with some caster sugar which is also called super fine sugar using my electric mixer at high speed i am going to beat both the ingredients together until my mixture looks light and fluffy all right this looks good and now into this i'll add a splash of vanilla and mix it in as well right this looks good and now into this i'll add in four eggs two at a time and mix them in as well now i haven't made this recipe without eggs yet but i promise to try that soon and share the recipe with you [Music] now in goes two teaspoons of white vinegar you could also use lemon juice in its place [Music] this looks good and now i'll add in the dry ingredients i'm only using two of them today maida which is all-purpose flour and cocoa powder [Music] [Music] [Music] and now one final ingredient for the brownie batter which is a tablespoon of red food color i am using liquid food color but if you are working with gel food color i think a few drops would be enough to get that beautiful red color [Music] so the brownie batter is ready this can sit on the counter while we get the work started on the cheesecake layer for the cream cheese filling all you need to do is to combine cream cheese eggs and sugar and give everything a good mix [Music] all right so the brownie batter and the cheesecake filling are both ready i've preheated my oven to 180 degrees celsius and i'll now transfer the batters into this nine by nine inch square pan

beat that this is all should look right here nice and creamy perfect next you're gonna throw in some slightly beaten eggs go ahead and mix that around really good until it is combined okay perfect just like that right there next it's time for the buttermilk anything red velvet must have buttermilk can't leave out that buttermilk next we're gonna add in some distilled vinegar gotta have distilled vinegar when it comes to red velvet go in some vanilla extracts okay and then it's gonna mix this up and now you'll notice as you're mixing this up your batter is gonna start looking kind of crazy and looking real spotted don't be scared you guys it's perfect how it's supposed to look it's just that buttermilk and that vinegar kind of working together don't crazy stuff don't worry about it okay now it's time for our red food coloring you really don't need much of this so I guess like maybe like two tablespoons so yeah and you can use a rag I you can use a blue you can make any kind of really you know velvet cake you want to alright go ahead and just stir this on up mix it up real good and after you're done mixing it we're gonna throw in some unsweetened cocoa powder just like them but I fold this in and then use my mixer to kind of crank it up and mix up until it's nice and smooth that's gorgeous beautiful bright red velvet okay never gonna add in some flour and add in a little bit of salt and you're gonna mix this up until it's well combined I like to start by stirring it a little bit and then go ahead and break that that mixer you want to mix up until it's all smooth and silky and beautiful okay make sure you scrape down the sides with that bowl really good we don't want any flour stuck to the bowl and then wallah nice and beautiful and silky better go ahead and pour this into a prepared pan I just lined up in with some parchment paper and then greased the parchment paper because I did not want these brownies to stick go ahead and shake it around a little bit to kind of get it nice and even and release those air bubbles we're going to bake this at 325 for about 30 to 35 minutes you know you want to check on it at the 25 minute mark when it comes out of the oven let it cool off it's gorgeous beautiful red color I could take it out of the pan and let it cool off just on the parchment paper and then I put it in the freezer to let it cool off company today and when it's done cooling off go ahead and cut it into little tiny squares these brownies are so chewy oh my god you like chewy for days and you can eat them plain just like this right here but I decided to go ahead and get me some white chocolate i melted some white chocolate and put it into a piping bag here and I just piped on some white chocolate I wanted to use some cream cheese like cream cheese glaze that were been so good but I wanted it to get firm the cream cheese would not get firm so I needs a white chocolate and then I sprinkled it with a little bit of wall nose you can decorate it any way you want to really but yet these were so good you have to make these if you are a red velvet lover okay they are the bomb okay let me taste one so you guys can see the inside you see actually I look at this beautiful they're so soft and chewy and they say soft and chewy for days like it was like on day four they were still very soft and chewy but yeah that's it

"hello and welcome to couch on crackerjacks today I'm going to show you how to make Oreo fluff also known as cookies and cream some places but this is a light and creamy and delicious dessert perfect for any barbeque or picnic or cookout that you're going to have on a hot summer day this would be great the kids love it adults love it it's just wonderful and it's super easy to make these the units that you'll need so let's get started now of course being Oreo fluff we're going to need some Oreos so I'm going to start off with some Oreo cookies here don't tell anyone these are actually generic not the real thing but you're going to need 24 cookies for the fluff itself and you just want to break these up into pieces don't go getting too rambunctious with this you want you know kind of biggish pieces you don't want total crumbs here you want some of those too you know some chunk to remain so I'm just breaking each cookie into maybe 4 or 5 pieces so I'm just putting that into a small bowl until we will need it here in a minute now for the actual fluff part I've got 4 ounces of cream cheese that I have let soften I've gone ahead and put that into a large bowl this is going to tone it down some of that sweetness make it so it's not so ungodly sweet to that I'm going to add a total of one and a half cups of milk here I'm just starting off with a little bit of milk and what you want to do is take your whisk here and whisk that cream cheese into the milk I'm just starting off with a little bit of milk here I will add the rest of it here in a second you just want to whisk it up until the cream cheese is dissolved in the milk then I'm going to go ahead and add in the rest of my milk and I'm also going to add in a three ounce package of instant vanilla pudding it's just regular strawberry and vanilla pudding here if you can't get instant vanilla pudding where you are the instant custard I think is the closest equivalent here but it's got to be the instant variety and again using my whisk I'm just going to go ahead and whisk that up until that pudding powder is dissolved in my milk and cream cheese mixture you know make sure that there are no lumps remaining and once that's thickened up a little bit you can go ahead and add and you're crushed up Oreos cookies and at this point I'm going to switch out to using a spatula and I'm just going to coat all of these cookie pieces in that pudding mixture this is going to help those cookies kind of soften up a little bit I'm not a big fan of crunchy cookies in my fluff so this works out perfect for me and then I'm going to add in a 16-ounce tub of Cool Whip just whipped topping you want the big tub here it's the about 16 ounce go ahead and get that all into your bowl here may want to be careful you just want to fold this you don't want to get real vigorous here because you can deflate that cool whip and that's going to end up being kind of like a runny fluff and it's not going to be fluff so just take it easy gently fold that in might take a minute or two to get everything mixed in and once that gets all mixed together you can go ahead and I'm just going to leave it in the same bowl that I mixed it up in because I'm not serving this to anybody but now would be the time to put it into your serving dish and then you want to cover this and put it in the refrigerator and let it sit over night you want everything to get nice and chilled you want those cookies to soften up a little bit and this will actually firm up and become an actual fluff then the next day when you are ready to serve this go ahead and take some of those extra cookies that you have leftover put those into a zip top bag and crush those up into little tiny crumbs and then right before you're ready to serve this go ahead and take those crumbs and sprinkle those on top as a nice fancy little decoration and there you go that's how to make your own gigantic bowl of homemade cookies and cream Oreo fluff definitely give this recipe a try the kids are sure to love it and it's just it's an amazing thing on a hot summer day so if you liked this video be sure to give a thumbs up I would greatly appreciate it subscribe for

you're not gonna be good at it like look at this i like  like i said uh like this isn't supposed to look like this i it looks like it literally looks like you know what it looks like it looks like a horse good morning everyone it's another day today's wednesday and i don't really have much plan for today except going to walmart i think i'm gonna go to walmart buy a swiffer to clean my house because of this guy i have to clean my house so yeah i needed an idea to do something today and i decided to bake so while i'm at walmart i'm gonna buy whatever ingredients that i need i do have like basic like flour all-purpose flour i have sugar pearl sugar i have water still don't know what to bake so i'm probably not just research that but i'm not really good at baking so most likely i'm gonna have to choose something that's easy to bake [Music] go [Music] [Music] all right so uh it's later today we're gonna bake i think um we're gonna bake actually i did figure it out what we're gonna bake today it's called cookies and cream truffles and they look like white chocolate balls but inside it has i'll show you guys the ingredients this isn't this dessert isn't really hard to bake so if you're like me you don't know you're not really good at baking i would choose this recipe because this this sounds this looks yummy and it has only three ingredients it has scent um it has oreo cookies it has cream cheese and white chocolate so it only has three ingredients to bake with it's gonna end up looking like a white chocolate balls so i'm excited it's not gonna be hard so if you're not really good at baking like me i think this is probably the best and easiest dessert to eat all right let's start this let's do this first we're gonna need i don't really know how it's gonna taste like but what's the worst thing that's gonna taste like chocolate okay you can't really go wrong from here so the first thing first we're gonna have to grind these oreo cookies into pieces and from the video it's obviously from tiktok um this person grinded them i don't know if i should grind this with uh thing inside okay so you grind them the way it is i'm sorry if if you thought i was baking i'm not baking but i'm making something okay i don't like baking so in general so the first thing first put these just drop them in there maybe i need a little more i think this is ethan's [Music] so i don't really know how to use this but [Music] i mean it's pretty obvious so okay ready damn holy [Music] okay well it's looking nice maybe i need i need more i think we need more so i'm gonna put more because i don't that's not enough to make what like what am i gonna make out of this [Music] i'm gonna put a little more we'll see how it is if this turns out to be real good then you guys can make the same thing maybe then you need measurements but right now i just want to know what it tastes like and i did say i'm going to bake tonight which i have to follow with my word and soon i have to do 200 pushups 200 squats [Music] just to keep up my word this year's resolution for me is going to be um not writing things down i'm not gonna write it down because [Music] okay i'm gonna grind this i totally forgot to grind it [Music] this thing is really powerful holy [Music] but yeah this this it it's so loud that it's it feels like it's gonna blow up like i feel like it's gonna you know like something [Applause] [Music] i smell something burning yo this is scary yeah so i think this is good enough but yeah i was talking about new year's resolution um you know people write them down to just follow up with their new year's resolution you and i both know no one really follows up with that thing [Music] so i'm gonna leave this there sorry guys it's a mess okay cooking with aiden is a mess but my new year's resolution isn't a list last year i did like write down some of the lists for me to do to follow up with my new year's resolution but i never followed up with my resolution i never you know so this year's new year resolution for me isn't a list of things you follow up with you were if you can follow up with your word then you're allowed to write down but if you're like me and you never follow with follow up with new year's resolution there's literally no point of um doing this what the is this blue what is this [Music] okay i'm gonna need about this much [Music] well this is how it turned out to be it's not really it's not that bad it's not really bad but i don't know it's looking decent i mean this is what it turned out to be [Music] it's honestly not much i'm not gonna lie this is a cream cheese i'm gonna put them in now all right so it's in here the second step is to mix them all together let me continue with my resolution talk [Music] i realized over the past two decades of my life that i can't follow up with my word so following up with whatever i said this year would be my new year resolution [Music] what writing things down like i don't even i don't know about you guys but me every time i write things down for my new year resolution i never um i never usually follow up with it it usually lasts about a week max then i never follow up with it so i think this year i'm just gonna set a goal of whatever i say this year i have to follow up no matter what whatever it is even if it's not that important and i'm saying oh i'm gonna eat breakfast every day for for this year i have to like i have to wake up and eat breakfast because i said it hold up they're not as mushy as i thought maybe i need to put more [Music] i'm gonna put a little more cream cheese because i think i need more little like this much more i honestly don't know how this is gonna look like this shouldn't be like look at this it's not like i'm supposed to make a bowl out of this maybe i have to put water but then that's not gonna that's gonna affect the taste so maybe i shouldn't put water i should put more cream cheese but like even if i put more which i did just now it it's still like powder looking maybe i have to like crunch them together before anything i'm gonna melt these because that is the recipe so this i'm gonna leave it like this i don't know i don't i don't really know what to do again this isn't how to bake this is more like watch me big and you know just kind of talk with the audience or of talk in front of the camera giving myself a reason to edit videos um i need a bowl i need a bowl i think this is good enough i don't this is still wet um i shouldn't swear right but yeah i think i'm gonna put these [Applause] just used all of them i don't know so i'm not a good cooker i'm not a good baker uh i'm just not i i love editing i love football but i'm not a baker let's watch this melt i don't know if i'm doing this right i think i did something wrong i don't i don't know i mean or else she would have told us like you need to put a little bit of water like why wouldn't she right so technically you don't maybe you don't need water yeah it's looking pretty nice i don't know i don't know if i did something wrong you know what while i'm waiting for this i'm gonna do push-ups so yeah i basically challenged myself um to work out every day for 30 days my workouts would be consisted of push-ups and squats 200 push-ups 200 squats it's pure body workout i i just thought it was a good idea to kind of record my journey for 30 days even though it's not a long and challenging thing to do it's still challenging for me i mean doing push-ups and squats 200 both every day no matter what no excuses i'm gonna put myself in a position where i have to do it maybe skip today but i can't i have to do 30 days because that is my new year resolution whatever i say i'm gonna follow up with i'll get it back up again the things that you won't be [Music] i wanted to do a little update on my uh 200 push-ups 200 squats challenge to be strictly honest for for about three four days you feel terrible you feel like like the next morning you can't get up and now you can't really use the muscles you know those like muscle eggs yeah i burnt this what oh my god [Music] oh my god this is bad so this is [Music] this isn't what it's supposed to look like [Music] guys like i said i already up like look at this what is this this is not even a white chocolate like this is burnt chocolate the reason why it's not white is because it's burnt so it's not even you see like you gotta do something you love because you're not gonna be good at it like look at this i like  i honestly thought this was not gonna be that hard i don't really know how it's gonna taste like but what's the worst thing it's gonna taste like chocolate and i still had the audacity to what what was i supposed to do am i not supposed to just melt them i don't know if you know please let me know like leave a comment down below since i already picked up let me go properly okay now i'm gonna put these inside still gonna follow the recipe there's nothing for me to up here there's three ingredients all i gotta do is mix them together and then dip them in a white chocolate a soup or sauce that i made [Music] that's what this is supposed to look like it's not gonna look the same but i don't mind it i mean i'm not gonna sell this like i'm not gonna sell this i'm gonna eat it myself all right so it's done um that's what it looks like like i said like this isn't supposed to look like this i it looks like it literally looks like you know what it looks like it looks like a horse [Music] like they just happen to have a good stomach no diarrhea that poops are perfectly fine today that's literally what it looks like it looks like yeah it looks like it's not white it's supposed to look luxurious it's supposed to be white covered but because i mixed everything up together now it's like i what is this this isn't a cookie this is not a cookie what is this this is more like brownie it's a failure i mean like it literally looks like a poo maybe i shouldn't bake it is what it is", "PKJzh9dvc1o": "[Music] what's up everybody I'm Steven Tyler Myers your man cube review host this is my cat sweet tea she's named after my favorite drink she's chilling down here in the man cave with me we're getting ready to watch a movie but first we gotta have snacks with the film so we have hostess brownies cookies and cream flavor at first when I saw these um being posted on the internet I didn't even see this here it said brownies so I thought they were just like cooking cream ding dong but ding dongs I'm pretty sure that it's probably just gonna have the same kind of nasty waxy coating that ding dongs have ding dongs used to be my favorite snack when I was little obviously one hostess went out of business I guess they became with a new owner and since then they have sucked so as usual they don't look as fancy as they do on the package but it's all about the taste not how it looks so it just smells like it actually smells like a ding dong so here's the Wario Oreo cookies and cream let's try this baby out sorry about their dinging my mice making pizza I think um surprisingly well Riley is very moist on the inside where's all you think how it would be very dry um it still has this nasty waxy coating on the outside which actually makes it kind of not good so this lies taste absolutely not anywhere near close took anything cookies and cream it tastes like a cosmic brownie with some crappy white chocolate waxy crap coating around it with some drizzle I have it's very moist and chewy so I actually like like I like the cosmic brownings by Little Debbie so there's kind of you know similar in a way um but the brownie itself is good I like it I like sweet stuff so for the sweet aspect of it it's good um they could have just made an actual brownie put it in a package now with this pot like that just a brownie just regular brownie you put that crappy bullcrap waxy coating like I'll have for these and it just kind of ruins it it doesn't have much to it it kind of more takes away from it um unless you're like a die-hard hostess fan I would not waste your time on this save your four dollars um this gets a five out of ten yeah don't waste your time on it five out of ten as always thanks for watching man kit review if you could hit this video give me a like subscribe if you haven't yet if you feel like it if not if

day [Music]", "QvxrIix2EGA": "[Music] hey guys I'm tomorrow the food director at Woolworths fresh magazine and today I'm going to show you how to combine two epic desserts so you'll never have to decide between a cheesecake or a brownie ever again we're gonna make one epic decadent raspberry cheesecake brownie plus I'm going to show you how to create a marbling effect that you can use with other desserts too let's get started okay so let's talk about the ingredients that you'll need for this epic recipes so for the brownie mixture I've got two types of sugar one cup of brown sugar one cup of castor sugar I've got three eggs 250 grams of melted unsalted butter half a cup of cocoa powder 1 cup of plain flour and I've also got a tablespoon of vanilla that I'm gonna use then for the Cheesecake mixture I've got 250 grams of cream cheese with a third of a cup of castor sugar 1 egg some more vanilla and then for the raspberry I've got 1 cup of frozen raspberries and a tablespoon of castor sugar that's a mouthful but I promise you this is really simple ok so step 1 I've preheated my oven to 160 degrees don't forget to do that and now I'm going to get on to the first component which is the raspberries so all I'm gonna do is stir that raspberry and the sugar together then pop it in the microwave for two minutes it's done so just grab your raspberries and what we've essentially done is made like a really quick little Jam which is going to be on the top of our raspberry cheesecake brownie so just give that a quick little stir set it aside first component done okay guys component number two so we're getting on to the brownie mixture and this is the simplest brownie mixture that you'll ever make and actually you could just make this by itself so shuffle some stuff we've got a little kitchen like I do and we're gonna start by putting in the melted butter I've made sure that it's cooled down just a little bit so it's not too hot when I add my other ingredients now add the sugar so I've got that brown sugar and the castor sugar so just give that a quick initial mix next ingredient half a cup of cocoa powder 1 cup of flour a little tip for you salt will help you balance out the sweetness of your brownie you only just need a pinch so mix those dry ingredients together I'm just doing it a little bit roughly at this stage next step crack your eggs just give them a little whisk add in those eggs then we're gonna give it another little stir to incorporate so the beauty of this brownie mixture is it's actually made all in One Bowl small lumps in your batter are okay we've got flour in there so we don't want to overwork the mixture actually I forgot one ingredient which is the vanilla so I'm adding in one tablespoon and then I'll just stir that in okay so that one bowl brownie mix is done that component too so set that to the side maybe clear some stuff away now and then it's time to get on to the Cheesecake mixture all right so I've got my food processor for my third component the cheesecake mixture if you don't have a food processor that's totally fine just use handheld beater instead so first ingredient the castor sugar and the cream cheese so it's really important that you have your cream cheese at room temperature so that we don't get any lumps in our cheesecake mixture okay so I'm lead off and pop them in oh it's not very graceful there we go lead on and blitz [Applause] okay so lid off cracking your egg and then add a dash of vanilla yes I do add vanilla to everything but nothing wrong with that so that's one teaspoon and then all I'm gonna do now is just scrape down the sides a little bit before we blitz it again all done so pop this into a bowl and then it's time to assemble our brownie okay so I've got all my three components done so that one bowl brownie mixture that kind of cheats Jam that I made with those beautiful raspberries and my cheesecake okay so I've got my sliced tin ready here I've lightly greased it and then I've put some baking paper on top you can see I've used two pieces of baking paper that so I can get some nice sharp corners to my brownie also I made sure to extend it at least two centimeters above the edges that so we can lift it out later building the brownie so I'm starting with that chocolate mixture so even we go so look at this isn't this super luscious and actually we could have just folded some chocolate chips through this brownie mixture and just left it at that try and get a nice even layer okay so pop this in the wash or if your house holds like mine someone's probably gonna want to clean that bowl this is no regular brownie so now I'm gonna show you how to create an incredible marbling effect so grab your cheesecake mixture dollop in that cheesecake mixture you don't need to be really precise with this but I am gonna try and evenly spaced out those little dollops so you can just go back over those dollars if you still got some mixture left in that bowl now dollop on your raspberry mixture so much the same way as we did with the Cheesecake I'm just gonna put some of that on top of that cheesecake mixture ooh fancy okay so all you need is a skewer and we're gonna use this little guy now to create that beautiful marbling effect so start by just dragging through that skewer in about two centimeter intervals through that mixture so you can see that it's already starting to ripple those mixtures together now what we're gonna do is three simple movements long ways to finish our marbling effect we are all done and I've done a little cleanup as well and so this is ready to go into the oven it's gonna take about 45 minutes or until there's only a very slight wobble it's done all right let's take a little look so I'm gonna be able to tell that it's done so if you grab the corner and you give it a little wobble and see how it's only wobbles very slightly in the middle it's perfect pop it on to the bench and we're gonna leave it to cool a little bit before we pop it into the fridge for at least two hours or overnight and it's ready to eat so there you have it so easy to make this at home we've got that rich decadent chocolate brownie balance with that creamy tangy raspberry cheesecake you will never have to decide between cheesecake or brownie ever again and how beautiful that little marble effect try this one at

undercook them a little bit so they turned out so good but I ate too many of them and I probably shouldn't have and they're like super sweet and chocolatey I think we should get a taste tester Vittoria you would think on both of you were you Ray Oh ten nine hey guys welcome back today I'm going to show you how to make the og stoner snack infused brownies this is literally the easiest recipe to make I do a lot of baking at home myself but brownies are one of the things I always use a box mix for there's something about a store-bought brownie mix the honestly is just so good I'm also gonna show you guys a couple tips and tricks on how to make your brownies even better I hope you guys enjoy this video now let's get to baking like I said this is the easiest recipe and you can use any cake mix you can find I happen to have this giant cosmos icebox of RW brownie mix so we're going to use this one when it comes to making this the ingredients you're gonna use are gonna depend this on the back of your box so it's gonna call for like milk water eggs and butter or oil just the ratio would be different so you follow whatever is on your box and for my mix I need 1/3 of a cup of water 1/3 a cup of vegetable oil and one egg so what you need to do is wherever it says butter or oil you just replace that with your infused butter oil I have my oil here that I melted I do think you'd be better with butter than it would be with oil but I'm using what I have this says to preheat the oven to 325 degrees I already that force my oven is ready to go so the instructions on here say and these are going to be very similar for most box mix it's placed water oil and eggs in a mixing bowl and stir it until fully mixed so water oil and eggs and we need 1/3 of a cup of water just a little tip here some of these call for water someone call for milk and some him call for milk or water this one specifically calls for water and usually if it just calls for water it's because there's already a milk powder in here so we don't need the English additional amount of milk but it never hurts to add milk as well we only creamy value ingredients make everything taste better the end but these guard le ones are like super rich so we have our 1/3 cup of water will pour that in there we'll crank our 1 hag into there and then our most important ingredients are butter or oil like I said I have already warmed mine up so I can measure it out better and it calls for one third of a cup so on that for one third of a cup if your recipe calls for 1/4 cup or whatever cup you use whatever is on the box so I poured a little bit too much I'm just going to force them back a jar there we go so 1/3 of a cup going in to the mixing bowl and then we'll just mix that a lot let me add in the brownie mix it smells so good I love cookie dough but I really loved round batter too there's something about raw baked things that well before they're baked that is just like so delicious it'll of scraping off the raw batter off after now a little like extra tip is if you want things to be like extra rich and extra chocolaty you add a little bit of espresso or instant coffee I have a stress up here I'm going to add a tablespoon of this hope it's not going to be too chocolatey by adding this because these are deli ones are already so chocolatey to start with but the espresso just helps bring up the notes from the chocolate just like adds of a more complex layer to it so now we're just going to mix that all in there's so many trunks of like there's chocolate chunks in here already but if you're going to have that you can add America like you could throw in a bunch of chocolate chips at this point you could add in I'm M&Ms or Reese's Pieces or what love Reese's Pieces I'd be so good but yeah you'd be having anything you like sure and you want to add something like Oreos I would add them once this is fully mixed and then just like fold them in so they can get to chunked up I don't know and that's literally it that's all you have to do then we just have to pour it into our baking dish and cook them with the same amount of time that's been recommended on the box and they're good to go now we'll just line our dish with some parchment paper and we'll pour the brownian directly in this box says to cook them for 45 minutes that seems kind of long but I'll check in on them so I'm just going to talk this into the other and set a timer to check on it in 30 minutes to get really like chewy delicious brownies you should actually look under cook them a little bit but if you go overboard they'll be like really gooey and gooey which like I don't really mind it's like brownie batter but if you're ever trying to decide how long to cook it for always take it out a little bit before you think it should come out because it probably will taste better when it comes out the oven it dries a bit and then it will be like the perfect texture so the brownies are done I ended up cooking them for 45 minutes so I actually did do as long as the recipe said to do here's how they look they kind of came out a little bit lumpy because the way I put the parchment paper in there but that's all good I'm thinking of doing Detroit what you think I can do edible cookie cookie dough for the top layer before you eat the cookie dough 100 cooking the brownies I already did that these are gonna be really good I'm talking to you not like I'm talking to you but like I'm just like saying these are gonna be like tasty so they turned out so good but I ate too many of them and I probably shouldn't have and they're like super sweet and chocolatey I think we should get a taste tester Vittoria oh fast we got the try brownie oh I would they look good feed me well I wish when should I have well that one's just taking vitamins you can eat the rest after yeah I think that one you would take on dog with you send it back hmm what's a boy were you Ray a 10-9 mmm what we did have you don't want it Oh Toledo is what to me is it peanut butter cookie oh no but it's like coconut oil video it's good compost the links with the cookie dough edible cookie dough delish well what I got a hair in it homies obviously mine", "VvJm4pQZ04s": "- [Claire] We always say this, I know, but these are actually the best brownies you're ever going to have. They're gooey, they're\nchocolatey, they're fudgy. Oh, they live up to every expectation you think a brownie should be. (lively music) We took all the tips and the\ntricks from the internet, from our old gramma's recipes, from places we'd worked, to find the best recipe that we could. Throw out every other recipe\nthat you have for brownies. This is the one you will use going forward for the rest of your life. (lively music) I'm not trying to toot our own horn, but beep beep, you know. (lively music) All right, guys, as always, prep your tin. You know what to do, butter and parchment. So the first cooking job\nthat I ever had was working for a pastry chef and he made\nthese incredible brownies. When you start working in kitchens, they always say write down the recipes 'cause you're gonna forget them later. And of course, I did not do that, but there are a few things that I remember from his recipe that I really wanted to incorporate into our brownie recipe. Obviously, good brownies\nneed good chocolate, and the chocolate bar you\nwanna use is dealer's choice. You can go for something really mellow like a milk chocolate bar\nor go into something really, really dark, like an 80% dark chocolate would work really well in here. We're gonna double up on\nthe chocolate so we're gonna use cocoa powder as well. Because we wanted a really\nrich, dark flavor and color, we went with the dutch processed. You can use regular cocoa powder here, but we're always looking\nfor that intense flavor, that intense color. The one on the left used\nregular cocoa powder. It's kind of drier on\ntop and almost too dense and fudgy on the bottom. We're adding a little\nbit of cocoa powder here. We're gonna add even more later. Espresso powder just\ndoes a really great job of enhancing any chocolate\nflavor in a recipe. If you're worried about the caffeine, you can get a decaf powder as well. It's not gonna taste\nlike coffee or espresso, it's really just another flavor enhancer. When we add the hot, melted\nbutter to the chocolate, cocoa powder and espresso powder, it's gonna help melt\neverything down and dissolve, which is gonna help keep our brownies really fudgy later on. (lively music) Sugars, we have granulated\nsugar, and then when deciding between light brown and dark brown, the real difference\nhere is that dark brown has more molasses, ergo more flavor. I don't even know what ergo means. Again, just wanted to knock your socks off with the flavor here and dark brown was the right one for the job. And we're also gonna add a bit of salt as it brings out the\nflavor in any baked good. (lively music) So we're gonna have six eggs. Always crack your eggs\ninto a separate bowl in case you get any shell. Best way to remedy that\nis to use the egg shell. It breaks the surface tension\nand is the easiest way to get eggshell out of your eggs. You can start by adding\none egg to the sugar just so you don't make a huge mess. Once you get it going though,\nyou can add the rest of 'em, no big deal. You don't have to be super\ncareful like you would for a cake for instance. So working for that pastry chef, one thing that he did with\nhis brownies is he would beat the living crap out of the\neggs and sugar and really, really incorporate tons of air, so much so that it would look like a super thick pancake batter almost. This is what happens when you\ndon't beat the sugar and eggs, kind of just falls really flat, right. The great thing about beating\nthe eggs and the sugar is you create a really solid foundation and you don't have to\nuse a chemical leavener. Then you're gonna pour\nin that beautiful ganache that we made. Oh my God. Actually, when we were shooting this, there is a crowd of\npeople around us 'cause we couldn't get over how\ninsanely delicious this looked. Oh God, I just, I can't\nbelieved we baked these. Honestly, I could've just\neaten the batter myself. (lively music) I'm really upset that America can't get on the metric system, but like fine. If we're gonna use cups,\nalways scoop and level, to make sure we have the\nright amount of flour. If you just take the cup\nstraight into the flour, it's gonna be denser\nthan you need it to be. And you're going to sift the\nflour and the cocoa powder into the mixture to make\nsure we have no lumps and just make sure that we're really quickly incorporating it\ninto the rest of the batter. (lively music) And fold. Because we beat all that\nair in with the eggs, we don't wanna totally deflate that, so just get the dry\ningredients incorporated as quickly as you can. (lively music) Pour the completed batter\ninto your prepped tin, smooth it out to make sure\neverything's pretty level. (lively music) And into the oven it goes. So these are gonna rise quite a bit. After about 20 minutes,\nwe're gonna take them out. This is my favorite tip\nof the whole recipe. Take the brownies out and slam\nthem on your kitchen counter. It's gonna crack the top as\nwell as evens out everything and you get a much more\nconsistent texture. These are the same recipe. The one on the left is not\nwhacked, right whacked. At this point, we're also\ngoing to add a bit of sea salt, optional but highly recommended. Adds a little salty bite,\nsweet and salty, always good. With a lot of baked goods,\nyou'll stick a toothpick in and no batter remains, then you're good. It's kind of not the\ncase with these brownies. You will have a good amount\nof fudginess that comes out on the toothpick. Trust us, they've been in\nthere for like 45 minutes. They're definitely cooked through. They're just fudgy. When they do cool down, they\nalso will deflate quite a bit. It results in a really even\ntexture all throughout. Again, I can't say fudgy enough. I don't even like fudge,\nlittle known thing about me, but these brownies are insane. I need to cut these nice. They need to be a good, perfect square. It's so satisfying to see a perfectly cut batch of brownies, obviously. (lively music) Oh my gosh, a little tip too, is to clean your knife after each cut. You'll see a little bit of\nthat fudginess comes off. They're fudgy but they're not dense. (lively music) And that is it. I mean, look at that texture. Look at it! This is like your go to brownie batter. It's amazing as is, but you can also mix in\nanything that you want, more chocolate chunks,\npotato chips, pretzels. This is like a phenomenal\nstandard brownie recipe but feel free to go crazy\nand mix in whatever you want. Making brownies from scratch, you know, there's other options out\nthere that are easier, but it's one of those\nfundamental baked goods that doesn't take a ton of technique, but they also go with\neverything and every event. You know what I mean? Like you have a break up, brownies. Birthday, brownies. Like, they kind of work for anything. Just one of those feel good,\ncrowd pleasing deserts, that's just always a win. Okay, that's fine. I'm just gonna keep\ntalking and we're leave it and it's gonna be fine. - [Male] You're funny, Claire. - [Claire] (laughing) Stop. - [Male] You're so funny. - [Claire] You're so funny. - [Male] You're funny. - [Claire] Beep, beep. - [Male] You're slacking. - [Claire] I guess.

making chocolate banana cheesecake brownies now if you love brownies and you like banana bread and cheesecake this dessert is for you because I'm taking all those three desserts and merging them into one and trust me I've tested this recipe and it's absolutely spectacular but before we get started don't forget to subscribe to my channel if you like what you see and of course if you're looking for the full recipe just click that info box down below and everything you need is there let's make some brownies we're gonna start on our banana brownie base now this is super duper simple you do need one banana and the key to the banana is to make sure that it's nice and dark and spotted so I mean this guy is not too bad but if you can get a banana that's super duper black even better because that means the banana flavor is gonna be more pronounced and it's gonna be a lot more sweeter okay so we're gonna peel the banana into my bowl and to that I'm going to add a little bit of white sugar as well as some brown sugar which is gonna give it this beautiful caramel II note as well as a pinch of salt and we're gonna mash this until it's smooth [Music] next up I'm gonna crack in an egg and if you don't eat eggs then you can leave that out and add an additional banana I'm gonna throw in a splash of vanilla as well as some melted butter whoo all of it all of it and we're gonna whisk this up until it's nice and incorporated and last step is to add our dry ingredients so I have a little bit of white flour here as well as my cocoa and we're gonna mix this all together until no white streaks or brown streaks can be seen [Music] [Applause] I'm an 8 by 8 inch baking tin but I've lined with a little bit of parchment paper and greased with some butter and we're going to pour 3/4 of the brownie mixture to form the base [Applause] so our brownie base is ready to go and as you may have noticed I only poured three-quarters of the batter into the tin and the remaining 1/4 is here now to that I'm going to add a spoonful of water because we're gonna create magic a little later on and we're gonna dilute this batter because this is gonna go on top of our cheesecake layer to create this beautiful marbled effect and thinning it out just a little bit will help with the swirl there we go I'm gonna set this to the side and now we're gonna work on our cheesecake layer the cheesecake topping could not be simpler we're starting off with this guy a big old block of Philly cream cheese it's about 8 ounces get that into the bowl well just like that you want to work with room-temperature cream cheese because it's so much easier to mix I'm gonna add in a little bit of sugar as well as a splash of the vanilla OOP there we go and we're gonna cream this until it's nice and smooth [Music] [Applause] and I'm gonna crack in an egg boom there we go oh look at that golden yolk and this is what's gonna help the cheesecake topping set and we're gonna whisk this again until the egg is nice and incorporated now it's exciting bit we're gonna bring everything together so we already have our brownie base now I'm going to take this beautiful cheesecake layer and we're gonna pour it all over the top and I'm gonna show you how to do the perfect chocolate swirl [Music] [Music] and now I'm gonna take my reserved brownie batter that we diluted with a little bit of water and I'm gonna put little spoonfuls all over the top and now you're going to use a chopstick like I have here or a toothpick and you're gonna start to swirl the Cheesecake into the brownie to create a beautiful design now let your imagination run wild there's no rules for this and the more you do this the more you get this crazy swirly action that makes it look like this belongs in like a French pastry shop or something perfect my chocolate banana cheesecake brownie is ready to hit the oven my oven is preheated to 350 degrees and we're gonna pop it in for about 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean so my brownies came out of the oven about 45 minutes ago and I completely let them cool down to room temperature and this is really important if you want to get a good slice on your brownie I've cut mine into 9 pieces and look at this baby the cross-section is unbelievable you have that beautiful marbled top and then when you look at the edges you have that contrast between the white and the dark so so beautiful and there's one thing left to do you guys and I've been waiting for this all day long and that is to taste so here goes you guys you have to make these brownies they're absolutely unreal the creamy cheesecake layer paired with the fudgy dark brownie with the bananas it's such a winning combination and guess what they're so so easy to make

salt and flour and so I got going on making these brownies so these are the cookie dough Oreo brownies from Laura in the kitchen so I got my butter first and kind of creamed that together and then added in my sugars and then mixed both of those together until they were pretty creamy I got quite a bit of air in there I made sure to scrape down my bowl as well then added in two eggs and a splash of vanilla and combined all of that and then I leveled out my flour and scooped it into my bowl and then added in it might become soda and a salt and my chocolate chip cookies and obviously this was the last ingredient for the cookie dough part of it and it's going to be very not as it's gonna be creamy ish not as you know hard as some cookies and then I got my hands wet instead of floured like the recipe says to kind of find everything out and once that was done I moved it over got the same bowl and made at my brownie mix just based on the way that it's written on the box I didn't alternate it all or change it at all it's just plain old dark chocolate brownie mix which is my preference and then after that I got going on the middle layer which is the Oreo so I just kind of laid them out they may or may not fit perfectly you may if you want to make sure they're all in there really well cut them in half but I didn't really care to do that and then after that I layered on my brownie mixture and if you can try to spread it out pretty evenly because you're gonna have to spread all of this around and you know you want to in the nooks and crannies but you don't want it to be combined if that makes sense like you don't want to just sink to too much so once that was all out of the bowl I just went ahead and spread it out kind of gently like I said you don't want to like push it into the cookies but look at that layer I've got all three of them and then I just baked it based on the instructions in the recipe which you can find a back down in the description below look how pretty it is I just love it and then what kind of a friend would I be if I didn't give you guys the crumb shot so I went ahead and cut it here you can see all of these beautiful layers it was so fun I loved seeing all the cookie dough and the Oreos and the brownies and then I sprinkled it with powdered sugar and this is what these look like when they're done alright guys so the brownies are cut and they're cool pretty much all the way I don't know about you I love me a warm brownie so I'm gonna give it a taste and see if it's love at first bite oh this is very rich this is I mean I know that these are very massive pieces but honestly even cutting this giant piece in half to me is a little big I don't get a ton of the Oreo cookie like flavor I feel like because the layers are chocolate chips Oreos brownies I feel like I mostly get chocolate chip cookie and brownie and the Oreo is just kind of like a creaminess but I think this is good like I think for like a kid's birthday or something extra special like that this would kind of be something to make I don't think you should make it I just like every Friday night but you do what you want to do it's just too much for me too much from a little heart but that being said this was a very fun recipe to make it was very easy I feel like the older I get the more I want simplicity in my life and this just a little too crazy for me but it's still very good I write this a ton on attempt yeah this is fun this board is getting so heavy it's like here do my little wrist like hope you guys had fun hanging out with me trying out this recipe with me and I appreciate it and don't forget to give me a thumbs up and subscribe while you're here and we meeting any requests down in the comments below and I will see you guys in the

cream fudge. This looks SuperDuper easy and\nsuper duper fun so if you guys want to see how this recipe turns out just keep\nwatching and I'll get testing. For this fudge I got going with my\ndouble boiler and then I put in my sweetened condensed milk and then I put in my white chocolate\nchip melty things and then actual white chocolate chips because that's what I\nhad to equal 18 ounces. And then just mix that together and I used a double boiler\nand set up the microwave like the instructions said because I was\nterrified of burning my chocolate so I just mixed it all together on a double\nboiler it wasn't really that much more effort and once it all melted I took it\nover to my counter and put it in my sandwich cookies and then just mix that\ntogether. And one thing I will say that this did not really mix very easily\nbecause the chocolate started to cool so once I did get it mixed together I\npoured it into my pan to let it sit for two hours in the fridge, and it was still\nkind of hard to get it to, I mean it still went, it just like you can see it\nhardened quicker. all right so here's what they look like\nwhen they're done they're super adorable like I can't help but smile when I look\nat them they kind of remind me of like a really thick cookies and cream Hershey's\ncandy bar so I'm super stoked to try this so let me go ahead and let you know\nif it's love at first sight. mm-hmm that's exactly what this tastes like\nholy moly these are super, like dangerously good I\ndon't even know what to say it's chewy it's really sweet really rich so I guess\nI would say that this is gonna go a long way this is less than half of what I\nmade and you don't need much these are super quick super easy I would\ntotally recommend you guys making them ten out of ten no complaints at all\nthese are super good and then this one would be fun to play around with the\nsandwich cookies now you can do like lemon ones or they have like peanut\nbutter chocolate ones like all kinds of different cookies you can put in here\nyou know you can even crush up your own like chocolate chip - these are bomb I love\nthese I'm gonna go ahead and watch the Netflix and have a couple of these so I\nhope you guys enjoyed watching this let me know if you did and you hit that love\nbutton for me and don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys later\nbye", "QgzjiR32q7M": "- If the best brownie ever and the most amazing chocolate\nchip cookie came together to make the perfect dessert, it might just be this\nchocolate chip cookie bar. Fudgy, gooey, crispy, crunchy. (chuckles) It has it all, including that brown sugar, that butter, that chocolate, the works. Hey, you're watching Preppy\nKitchen, where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make\ndelicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends. These cookie bars are\ngonna whip up in a snap, so let's get started. First off, prep your\neight by eight inch dish by lining it with\nparchment paper, or foil. I like parchment paper better, because it just fits so nicely in there. Look at this. Perfectly in there. You can lift it right out. Nothing's gonna tear either. Okay, set that aside. Now let's whisk up the dry ingredients, starting with 2 1/4 cups, or\n270 grams of all-purpose flour, one tablespoon of corn starch. Using a teaspoon of salt here. I want it to be nice and have a good bite to contrast with all the sweetness of the chocolate and the sugar. Now, one teaspoon of\nbaking soda for leavening. 'Kay, whisk it all up, set it aside. And now for the wet ingredients. We've got some other parents coming over for a combined play date, so I thought these chocolate\nchip cookie bars would be the perfect easy snack\nto have hanging around, in addition to some coffee. (chuckles) Into a large bowl, I'm adding 3/4 of a cup, or 170 grams, of a melted butter, 2/3 of a cup, or 133 grams,\nof regular white sugar, and then one cup, or 200 grams, of brown sugar, lightly packed. 'Kay, you can mix this up. It's gonna form kind\nof a thick slurry now, a butter/sugar slurry. If you have lumps of brown\nsugar, just mash them up. Now I'm gonna add in one tablespoon of a nice vanilla extract and aromatic. Oh, I love it. And then two room temperature eggs. Switch to a whisk. And yes, you could do\nthis in a stand mixer or with an electric mixer, but if I'm making\nchocolate chip cookie bars, I don't mind getting a little exercise in. Whisk it together. Try not to eat this right\nnow, because it is just like heaven on a stick. I don't know what to say. It's delicious, but control yourself. And after it's whisked together, you're gonna dump in the dry mixture. This is so easy. It's like, \"Hello, why isn't this every day?\" And I'm gonna use my\nspatula, just to fold it in. You could use a whisk. I just think it'll be a little bit easier. And to be honest, I like the way it feels. It's so like, ahhh. It's bringing me some\nrelaxation vibes. (chuckles) And once this gets to a point\nof being mostly incorporated, we're gonna add our chocolate chips, And you have choices here. Just chocolate chips? Sure. Add some more things? Why not? So you could add in\nhalf a cup or a full cup of chopped toasted pecans,\nor walnuts, macadamia nuts, whatever you like. And then for the chocolate itself, yes, you could use semi-sweet chocolate. If you're following along on a blog, But today, I'm gonna mix it\nup and use half-and-half, semisweet and bittersweet. So, the only thing I'm gonna tell you is take the handful of chocolate\nchips and set them aside. This is so you can just dot\nthe top of your cookie bars with some nice clean chocolate chips, the same that you would do with cookies. So, set those aside. And now toss the rest in, and fold 'em in. If you want, you could\nuse M & M's in here, or butterscotch candy. It's really like whatever\nyou enjoy eating. The only thing I want\nyou to do is just try and distribute the chocolate\nchips fairly evenly, so that one bar has one chocolate chip and the other one is\ncomplete chocolate chips. No, you wanna have it be fairly even. And here, you see, in this step, we're just finishing up\nwith the mixing as well, so any little pockets of the dry mixture are gonna be worked in there. This is ready to transfer to our prepared eight inch baking dish. You could use a nine\ninch baking dish as well. That'll just be a bit thinner, but that's still totally delicious. 'Kay, plop this in here carefully. Plop. Actually, (chuckles) doesn't have to be carefully. This is reminding me of my brownie recipe. You can click up here for that. Oh, my God, that brownie\nis like the fudgiest, most delicious thing in the world, with that nice crackled top. Ah, it's amazing. 'Kay, just smooth the top out. This recipe is seriously the\neven less fussier version of a chocolate chip cookie, 'cause there's not worry about anything, anything at all. (chuckles) You're just dumping\neverything in, mixing it up. And now, I can take my\nreserved chocolate chips, and just dot the surface with them. I'm gonna just have some\nnice glossy chocolate moments all across the top, and you're gonna get that the best way if there's no cookie batter. One last thing before I forget, and this is totally optional, is you can take some flaked sea salt, and just sprinkle it on top. Just a little bit of\nthat crunchy, salty bite with the chocolate and the brown sugar, you're gonna love it, unless you don't. In which case, skip that step. It's up to you. All right, now you're gonna\npop this into the oven for 30 plus minutes. It kinda depends on\nhow done you want them. Do you want that kinda gooey, delicious, fudgey moment in the middle? Then 30 minutes. Do you want them baked that are a bit more set up? Add an extra five or 10 minutes on there. It's really your personal preference. I'm currently intoxicated by\nthis amazing cookie bar to be. Look at this. Do you see? What? (laughs) It's so good. Oh, my gosh. All right, this is now\nfirm enough to remove without it crumpling. You just wanna let it set. Remove that paper. Do you see how amazing this\nparchment paper situation is? It's one of my favorite things. We're just gonna cut these up into bars, and they will go in a flash. It'll be so quick. You can go big or small\ndepending on how you feel. I don't know. Let me know in the comments if you want the edge piece, or the middle. I'm conflicted myself, so\nI'll have both. (chuckles) Oh, my gosh, look at this. This is like a crime scene of chocolate. Molten chocolate inside. Look at that. If you could smell this,\nyou would be in heaven. I wanna just have this\nwith a bite of ice cream, or some milk and go to sleep. (chuckles) No one's gonna notice if I just sneak one. If you like this recipe,\ncheck out my cookie playlist, all of my favorite cookies, and you're gonna definitely find your new favorite there too. Okay, time for a bite. Oh, my gosh (chuckles), I got like palpitations. (chuckles) This was so good. It really is the cookie\nversion of a brownie. You've gotta try this recipe.

one is cookies and cream brownies start with your favorite brownie mix I'm just using this Betty Crocker ultimate because I got a box of 4 at sams and I neither lots of brownies to do these videos so you start off by putting the brownie mix in the bowl adding your eggs and oil and most of your water this recipe calls for 2 tablespoons of water so I'm only using one tablespoon of water and then I'm going to use one tablespoon of vanilla add that in so just substitute 1 tablespoon of your water for vanilla and then mix them up once you have them almost completely mixed up you're going to want to add one and a half cups of mini oreos you don't have to use mini oreos you can use regular oreos and kind of break them up but I just happen to have these because they were on sale so finish mixing all that in and once it's completely mixed in we are going to pour this into a prepared pan just reached the bottom of the pan I'm going to be using an 11 x 7 but you can use a nine by nine and eight by eight it really depends how thick you want your brownies and you just dump your batter in might be a spatula for this you want to make sure you get all of that yummy chocolatey goodness out and then spread them in the pan now we're going to pop these in a 350 degree oven which I have preheated for probably about 40 to 45 minutes just follow the directions on the package for the size pan you're using here they are fresh out of the oven they took 42 minutes to bake and a little trick is to take a knife and I know if you can see it right there or toothpick about two inches in from the side you poke that in and if it comes out clean your brownies are done now for the hardest part we're going to let these sit until they cool completely before I cut into them here is the finished product I know what kind of looks just like regular ordinary brownies oops but inside and if you can see right and see right here the cookie there are these delicious cookie bits and the great thing is the oreos kind of soften as they're baked and they taste amazing so I really hope you try these and let me know what you think of them if you do so if you like this video give it a thumbs up and

guys don't have to do cookies and cream cake but it's mine so I'll see you in the slideshow", "FVlkH512rPE": "Oh hi guys I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I'm going to show you how to make a very sort of rich my mouth is salivating just thinking about it delicious dessert for the summer it's my brownie ice cream bars they are really rich but good thing is a little piece goes a long way because it's got such great flavors the first thing we're going to start with is the base which is the brownie base and for that you're going to need some all-purpose flour cocoa powder instant espresso salt some bittersweet chocolate that's been melted and it's just sitting here cooling some granulated sugar eggs vanilla extract and some unsalted butter softened at room temperature now the other needs to be preheated at 350 I also have a 9 by 9 inch square baking pan here and I've lined it with parchment paper you want to make sure that you line it with parchment paper so that it comes off the sides because when we go to serve these we need to be able to lift them out so let's get started very easy very simple really kind of staple brownie recipe that we're starting off with I'm going to add the butter in my sugar I'm just going to cream this together until it's nice and thick bind and add in my eggs and vanilla and need a little bit of vanilla in here even though it's chocolate brownie alright just combine this mix until it's nice and combined I'm going to add in my bittersweet chocolate that's been cooling here and you want to make sure that your melted chocolate is well hold a little bit otherwise it could scramble your eggs also it's a quick tip I'm just running my spatula along the sides right now but when a recipe calls for it say this recipe for example is going to say one and a half cups of bittersweet chocolate melted you want to make sure you measure it before you melt it you don't want the end result to be melted chocolate a cup and a half and this me a cup and a half of chocolate chips or whatnot and then you melt them down just going to combine this until it's nice and a creamy mixture and I just add our dry ingredients I mean very easy can't really get any easier than that and every time you add an ingredient you just make sure you kind of mix it from the sides of your bowl just to make sure you're kind of incorporating everything all right it looks good I'm just going to switch to my whisk now all righty just mix it from the sides now I am baking this in a nine by nine rather than eight by eight because we have so many layers going on I don't want the brownie layer to be this thick I want to be a little on the thinner side so all I'm going to do now is put this two in put the batter in my baking dish whoops and then just flatten it till it sits nice and even and then I'm going to pop it into the oven to bake for around 25 minutes or so or until it's fully cooked through let it cool completely and I'll show you the next step my brownies baked for about 30 minutes I let them cool completely they need to cool for several hours otherwise it through we're molding warm it's going to end up being a big mess now what I have here are some sliced strawberries and I've got some ice cream now you can use any ice cream that you like I'm using a turtle flavor ice cream because I love it but no sweeches own any flavor you like I mean I just say keep it in - like caramel vanilla chocolatey family because that's what works best now I've made this recipe tons and tons of times throughout the years weeks ago my brother-in-law had it was his birthday and my sister-in-law ordered him an ice cream cake from his favorite bakery and we were eating an ice cream cake get his little birthday celebration and through and I was taking a bite there was something between the layers of the ice different ice cream in the cake and all but was sharp and refreshing and I said what is in there it's so good she says all there's a layer fresh strawberries and I said what she said yeah they put a layer of fresh strawberries so when I made this the next one a couple of weeks ago after his birthday I added the strawberries and it is unbelievable it's that tart that freshness that kind of sets it apart a little bit it's just it's absolutely delicious so any way you want to make sure your ice cream is softened otherwise it's going to be really really hard to spread over your brownie base and I know this is very rich but hey you know you're not going to eat it every single day it's an absolutely it's a treat so you know don't beat yourself too much over it and I can get easily 32 squares out of this and it would be perfect portions so what I'm going to do just level this out as best as I can this is going to get another layer on top after the strawberries but for now I'm going to just take my strawberries and I'm going to nestle them in my ice cream once you add them all in there trying to cover them up as best as you can but it's not necessary now what I'm going to do is I'm going to cover this with plastic wrap I'm going to pop this into the freezer for several hours I need the ice cream and the brownie to be really nice and frozen so when I pour the last layer on top nothing's going to melt all over the place I'm gonna cover with plastic wrap stick it into my fries so I'm gonna leave it in there overnight just cuz it's easier and it's already the evening here I'll be up to 4 o'clock in the morning to show you how it looks like when it's fully frozen I'm gonna pop this in and I'll show you what it looks like when it's done and then we'll add in our last and final layer it's time to make the last component to our brownie ice cream bars now my ice cream and brownie base was in the freezer overnight I just took it out and what I've got here is some cream that's coming to a simmer which actually is at a simmer and I've got some semi-sweet chocolate in this big measuring cup but you can use anything really I'm going to pour my cream over and I'm not going to do anything to it for about 3 minutes the only thing I'm going to do is kind of push the chocolate down to the cream that the cream is kind of covering any everything I'm going to let this sit here for about three minutes then I'll show you the last and final step before we cover this entire beauty with that ganache now I'm going to just whisk this up and it's going to take just a second but as soon as you get your whisk moving it's all going to melt together beautifully trust me on that that looks great now what you're essentially made is a ganache okay my spatula get this all poured on your ice cream now you're going to work fast because you don't want everything to start melting together because chocolate mixture is warm so work very fast to smooth everything over get it from end to end covering it all up to see how that ice cream is gonna start melting we don't want that so that's great I'm going to pop this back into the freezer for another hour or so or until it's fully set and I will show you what it looks like once it's done oh that looks good this was in the freezer for about an hour so you want to make sure you take it out about not five minutes before you go over to cut them otherwise there are two frozen and you won't be able to get a nice cut out of them and then just cut them into your desired size that's it good tip is to have either a kitchen towel or a paper towel or just something near you that's wet and that way it's really easy to clean in between each slice and not get kind of dirty and messy and all over the place but you do want to work quickly because you are working with ice cream here I think I'll just cut these for now put the rest in the freezer because I don't have that many people over for dinner but mmm then go for the first one we gave we cut up mmm they're brown it hardens up to almost like a cookie and that strawberry is really that fresh bright thing that it really is needed with all that sweetness mmm cold definitely a treat but worth making if you've got company coming over hop on over to Lauren kitchen comm to get this recipe if we love a good Ice Cream Sandwich this has been taped up ten notches I hope you enjoy spending time with me and I will see you the next one bye bye", "p7REAXE9H7E": "if i could turn back the clock and make sure that i defeated the dark i'd spend every hour of every day keep", "OTwCYadKan4": "hey everyone it's James for funfoods\nand today I'm gonna show you how to make this delicious Oreo no baked dessert\nnow this is absolutely amazing so keep watching and I'll show you step by step\nhow to make this the first thing we'll do is start off some Oreo cookies now it\ndoesn't matter if you're using double stuff like I am or single stuff in fact\nI have some single stuff and some double stuff I'm just gonna mix them together\nnow you want to use about 15 to 20 and that depends on the size of our dish now\nI'm going to use a food processor for this but you can alternatively put this\nin a plastic bag and just smash it into little bits and that will work fine as\nwell this just makes it a little finer put in\nyour Oreo cookies and pulse it only takes a couple seconds but when\nall of your Oreo cookies are smashed to bits just double check make sure there's\nno large pieces now I have a half a cup which is one stick of melted butter just\npour that around give it a light mix perfect so I've decided to add another\nfive Oreo cookies to this so that makes my 25 total now I'm using an 8 by 11\ncasserole dish now most of them are no 13 by 10 13 by 9 so this is a little\nsmaller than yours might be but I'm just gonna take our Oreo crumbs spread it out\non that dish and I do like my base to be very buttery now of course you can use\nhalf the amount of butter I used if you like yours to be very crumbly and just\nspread it out now just take this put this in a refrigerator while we work on\nthe rest of our ingredients next I have a large bowl here in that bowl I have\n1/2 cup which is one stick of butter that's softened at room temperature next\nI'm going to add 1/4 a cup of vegetable shortening and then just blend this\ntogether next we're just going to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and mix that now we're gonna add between one and two\ncups of powdered sugar I'm gonna start off with one cup and then go half of a\ncup at a time until we reach the consistency we're looking for and that's\nthe consistency we're looking for we don't want it to be too thick it needs\nto be spreadable so once you get to that point then you can stop mixing now we're\ngonna make another layer which is going to go over top of the placed Oreo\ncookies and to do that I have a large bowl and I want to add one cup of heavy\nwhipping cream and with the whisk attachment we want to whisk this up\nuntil it forms stiff peaks and after its forms stiff peaks we can move on to the\nnext step next I have a 14 ounce can of sweetened condensed milk we're just\ngoing to add that to our whipped up heavy cream and we just want to fold\nthis in don't want to over mix it just fold it in now I'm not happy with the\nhow this turned out so I want to add another cup of heavy whipping cream but\nI'm gonna do it in a separate bowl and whip it up first before I add it to this\nand now that we've whipped that up we're gonna just simply fold this in to our\nother mixture here and this is a much better consistency\nthan I had with just one cup of heavy cream so I do highly recommend using two\ncups now just pull out your crust from the refrigerator and we're gonna start\nassembling this now start off with our first filling that we made I'm just\ngonna get a nice big scoop put it right in the middle and using an offset\nspatula I'm just gonna spread a nice thin layer over the whole thing and once\nthat's done nice and even now we're gonna add some Oreo cookies to that for\nthis step I do like to use the double stuff so you can use the regular if\nyou'd like but I think the double stuff would be so much better next we're gonna\ntake our big filling with the heavy cream that we mixed up and we're gonna\ncover over top this whole thing now we're going to decorate this and the\nfirst thing I did was melt down some chocolate and put it in a piping bag so\nI just want to drizzle a little chocolate over it next I have these mini Oreo cookies and\nI think I can just lay those around and maybe stand up a few of the big Oreo\ncookies and take about three Oreo cookies put it in a plastic bag let all\nthe air out and we're just going to crush these down and use the crumbs to\nsprinkle across the top so after two or three Oreo cookies I did remove the\nfilling for a moment then I crushed them up in this little baggie I'm just gonna\nsprinkle the crumbs all over this and that's it that's our Oriole no baked\ndessert you want to take this put this in refrigerator for at least an hour to\njust a firm it up a bit before you want to cut it up and serve it all right so\nI've had this in refrigerator for a couple hours now we're gonna cut it up\nand serve it now the first piece isn't going to come out too clean\nso I kind of just push that out of the way I'll use that as my taste test and\nthe rest I can put on a plate and serve so I'm just gonna... look at that look at that that's amazing\nsee all the layers mmm well now its time to taste-test I'm gonna dig into this\nand see how we did there we go we've got a little bit everything on here and\nwe're give it a shot mmm wow this is incredible that first layer of filling\nwe put on there is actually the same taste of the filling of the Oreo cookie\nand then of course you had the cookies and they have filling in there and then\nthat heavy cream which is like a Cool Whip and that on top mmm this is amazing\nwell thanks everyone for watching I hope you enjoyed watching you make

a knife or offset spatula and just kind of swirl that Nutella all throughout the batter create happy little peaceful swirls this is so therapeutic I couldn't stop y'all I really couldn't stop but eventually I stopped and I place this into my oven at 350 for about 18 to 20 minutes and don't over bake it we don't want to dry brownies keep an eye on it okay so while our brownies are cooling off we are going to make our ganache our Nutella ganache so I'm gonna add some sour cream into a bowl dump that sour cream on in there I like making this with sour cream because it's just kind of yeah I like it next we're gonna add in some melted chocolate you can use dark chocolate milk chocolate semi-sweet chocolate just use your favorite chocolate I just melted a little candy bar now it's good to go okay next we're gonna add Nutella gotta have that Nutella okay Nutella into that bowl and now we're just going to stir it up go ahead stir it up and then that is it okay this is gonna be the topping for our brownies and it is so so good so go ahead and place that right on top of those cold brownies and next we're just going to kind of just spread it all out just like that it's so pretty that pretty is like a pudding almost nice and silky and smooth go ahead and spread it out until this a nice even layer then we're gonna add a little bit of chopped hazelnut look crunch and then I'm also gonna add a little bit of shaved chocolate yep that makes it so pretty okay now we're gonna place it in the fridge just until it is chilled and that ganache is nice and set and then when it's time to cut it go ahead and remove it from the pan and cut it into little squares these brownies are like so rich you could really get away with just cutting them it's a little tiny you know one and a half inch squares but look at that I love how have like different layers of spudgy and then that creamy thick ganache on top it's like the perfect perfect brownie I hope you guys enjoyed this video don't forget to subscribe and check out my other videos later [Music]", "EBzx99-FP0w": "[Music] hey y'all and welcome to this wrinkle factory YouTube channel where we cover everything culinary this is just sprinkling I'm back with another delicious recipe make sure you guys hit the subscribe button and join our sprinkle squad today we're adding to our lovely list of youtube recipes cookies and cream banana pudding let's get right into it you guys the first thing that we're gonna start by doing is separating six eggs so you want six egg yolks and I'm just showing you guys an easy way to separate the yolk from the white just crack it into your hand and let the yolks fall between your fingers and you have a perfectly separated egg yolk so we're gonna get these all done and then we're gonna go over some of the ingredients for the pudding now let's get into the ingredients for the pudding you guys it's quite a few but it's super simple because we're gonna dump everything in the bowl then in the pot then we are going to end up with a delicious rich custard that we're gonna use for this lovely banana pudding so the first thing that we are going to start by doing is we're going to combine our wet ingredients so the first thing that we have is going to be half-and-half which we have about four cups of half-and-half and then one cup of heavy whipping cream now a lot of people use just milk but honestly using the half-and-half which is half cream and half milk and adding extra cream really just makes it a more richer custard so the next thing that we're gonna do is we're going to dump our seperated six egg yolks yolks give those a nice mix you guys and make sure that they are pretty well incorporated and then after that we're going to add in a cup of sugar with this recipe you're able to alter the sugar so if you think you're gonna want it less sweet you can of course add less sugar I think one cup is the perfect amount for this recipe bill the next thing that we are going to do is we're gonna add the cornstarch now the cornstarch is going to act as a thickening agent to make the custard nice and thick so you want to make sure that you add that in as well as of course pinch of salt just a tip whenever you're making a dessert always add a pinch of salt some people think it's weird that some things such as salt should not be in a sweet dish but honestly salt is a flavor enhancer and you definitely need it when you're making desserts okay so the next thing that we're gonna do is we're going to make sure that everything is incorporated after that we're going to pour it in our pot make sure that your pot does not go past medium-low heat and I'm gonna start the cooking process [Music] now once they're put anyhow thickened you want to make sure that you put in two tablespoons of cold butter and add your vanilla while it's hot as well the butters gonna add that final richness as well as a bit of Sheen and the vanilla of course obviously it's gonna add that wonderful vanilla flavor for your vanilla pudding as you guys saw it took next to no time for this to thicken up how you know it's completely ready it coats the back of a spoon nicely so the next thing we're going to do is we're going to transfer this into a bowl that you're going to use for your refrigerator when it's time to chill it and then we're going to add a few sandwich cookies so about four or five into the pudding itself I do this while it's hot so the cookies can kind of melt into the pudding giving it that familiar cookies in cream color now once we do that we're gonna fold this and then we're going to chill it and then we're gonna work on the whipped cream element [Music] super simple you guys the next thing never gonna do as if this desert could couldn't get any richer oh we're gonna go ahead and work on our whipped cream that we're gonna fold into the pudding to make it even lighter so we're gonna put 2 cups of cold heavy whipping cream into the mixer we're gonna mix this together and once it forms stiff peaks we're gonna add the vanilla and 1/4 a cup of condensed sweet milk just like that you guys super simple and this whipped cream is delicious on its own so if you wanted to make a bunch of it and use it for a different dessert trust me is super super delicious I can probably just eat it right out of the bowl um so the next thing that we are going oh and then also y'all use your your whisk okay not a paddle sorry it couldn't find my list okay moving on um what we're gonna do next is we're gonna add half of the whipped cream into the pudding gradually get yourself a rubber spatula and fold it so fold it over itself so you're not deflating the whipped cream all the air that you pumped into that whipped cream you want to make sure that you keep everything light and luxurious and delicious super simple as always now the next thing you want to do is you want to set up your layering station so we have some bananas we have some vanilla wafers we have to keep it somewhat classic with the banana pudding flavors in my opinion if you have brown spots on your bananas you guys do not throw the whole banana way cut it off and then work with the rest of what you got okay so cut them into about half inch slices nothing too fancy if you wanted to kind of do a different shape you can cut them on a diagonal but literally you just mean banana slices and we are going to begin hiring there's really no right or wrong way to do this you guys there's throwing all your favorites throw in as much as you want this is yours okay you're making it for your family your friends your holiday potluck at work y'all just doing your own thing as much as you put into this is what you would get out and trust me once you're past cooking the custard there's really no way at all that you can actually mess this up so have fun with it if you like more vanilla wafers put more vanilla wafers if you like to break your Oreos up into crumbs break your Oreos up into crumbs you guys if you don't like bananas at all I'm gonna make the bananas if you love them put extra bananas in it I'm probably gonna use about four bananas in total but do your own thing okay do your own thing is totally totally super delicious regardless of how you layer this okay after we do this we are going to top it with the remaining whipped cream remember we only folded half of the whipped cream into the pudding itself and we're gonna save the rest for the top and crumble some cookie crumbs on top of course for decoration and once we finish doing all of that I'm gonna show you guys a couple of different ways that you could possibly present this to your loved ones [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] just like that y'all allow it to chill in the refrigerator for a few you can give it about 30 minutes to an hour or as long as you like I like my cookies to be soft so I chill mine for this an hour and hour and a half or whatever whatever you want to do um but as you guys see it is totally delicious all of those flavors have married together and become one and what I wanted to show you was a really cool idea if you're having like a Christmas party and you wanted to make small desserts for everyone it's really cool and really easy to layer these individually and then also super pretty [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] of course before I let y'all go in true sprinkle factory fashion let's slow it down with a slow-mo [Music] [Music] and just like that you guys you have made cookies and cream banana pudding trust me once your family and friends taste this it's going to become a holiday tradition as it has with my family thank you guys so much for watching I love y'all so so so so much as my grandma would always say this dish is finger lickin time make sure you

"xi5sFFMuQCM": "hello and how is your Easter going so far mine is going pretty well I'm here at the crumbs and doily shop in Soho I've almost reached maximum chocolate capacity at Easter but I reckon I've still got a little bit more room and swing some in so I thought I would show you something really fun and chocolatey to make it's like an Easter egg that's better it's my recipe for chocolate cream eggs got it now if you're not familiar with what a scotch egg is because it might be kind of well Scottish or British maybe you don't have it where you come from it's basically a small egg either a quail egg or even in just a normal sized egg wrapped in sausage meat covered in breadcrumbs and then deep-fried which obviously is not really how I roll on the cupcake Gemma channel so I thought I would swim up and make some really tasty sweet chocolaty work for you and I'm going to be using Cadbury cream eggs for my egg part you can use any kind of egg you like but these ones are perfect so not only am I going to show you how to make a really cool treat in a chocolate scotch egg I'm also going to show you how to make caramelized white chocolate and that is a really neat thing to know how to make because you can use it in a bunch of other stuff but that's going to be a little bit later on for now I'm going to show you how to make the meaty part of the Scotch egg and for the beauty part I'm going to use chocolate cake because that's better than me and I've got some offcuts that the guys are the bakery saved for me for this very thing so go behind a bowl for later and for now and make some chocolate ganache just using 100 grams of dark chocolate and hundred grams of double cream and I'm putting that in the microwave for 30 seconds hey it's hard in 30 seconds I'm going to give it a sir but it will probably need another 20 or 30 seconds as well [Music] so once your chocolate and cream is completely melted together it is ganache but it needs to be set till it's our kind of truffula consistency so I'm going to put that in the fridge for about half an hour to an hour okay so this is on really nicely spreadable and now I just need to add cake crumbs to it so here's my chocolate cake this is just regular chocolate cake you can use my chocolate cupcake recipes you want that's exactly the same and I'm just going to crumble it all into my bowl it's a really good way of using out your cake scraps or quite often when I make layer cakes I will put the scraps in a ziploc bag into the back um in the freezer and then I can use them for things just like this when you put quite a lot of crumbs in now is the time to give it a stir because this isn't an exact science you don't always use the same amount of crumbs you just want to get it to a nice moldable consistency so give it a stir see how you get on and add more crumbs if necessary now I think that's still a little bit on the wet side so I'm going to go ahead and put some more crumbs in that is just about right it's kind of smashable and squeeze a ball and that is just right and now I'm going to put some rubber gloves on and get rolling so my project I'm going to start by getting a ping pong ball sized amount of my cake mixture and rolling it roughly into a ball and making a little impression with my son and that is where I'm going to pop a little cream egg and then gently just work the cake mixture around the egg so it completely covers and then roll it into nice meatballs [Music] and I just keep going into the Geezer all electrical and once you roll all your Scotch eggs they just need to be refrigerated for about half an hour meanwhile we can go on with making the caramelized white chocolate right now I think so I think that what I get to show you how to make caramelized white chocolate which is a very very delicious thing which sounds really interesting but it's actually really simple to make so I'm starting off with a small baking tray which has 250 grams of good-quality white chocolate and here whack-bat in the oven at 100 degrees C 10 minutes at times after each 10 minutes take it out give it a really good stir with a rubber spatula spread it out and then put it back in for another 10 minutes now it might look a little bit like it's seizing up but don't worry because every time you stir it around it's going to loosen up a little bit more once that reaches a lovely caramel color it's ready and you can take out the course now it is time for the messy and the best bit which is do you cover it all in chocolate and crumbs and I've made some bread crumbs here just with some leftover vanilla cupcakes you can also use vanilla layer cake if you want and what I did was I just crumbled it up and put it into the oven at about 150 for 10 minutes until it went all golden brown like this and it's absolutely perfect looks just like bread crumbs so now I need to dip my brown chocolate balls into my lovely caramelized white chalk and then use forks for this make sure the whole thing is covered by rolling it around with your Forks and then once it is just off the excess and then put it onto a wire rack [Music] and now that they were all covered in lovely caramelized white chocolate it's time to cover them in the bread crumb and I'm simply going to roll them around and push all the crumbs in so that is your chocolate Scotch eggs made and I think you'll agree that there are a lot more fun and a lot more pleasant Nathan regular Scotch eggs and the best thing is you don't have to cook them so you can eat them straight away and there it is very cool very exciting much nicer than a regular stuff is an egg Scotch egg I'm going to enjoy using that and I hope you enjoy making them and have a brilliant rest of Easter and if you want to keep up to date

how to make Oreo brownies so first you're going to take one box up any kind of brownie mix that you live and you can have any kind of Oreos and you can have double stuff triple STUFT Mary's doctor just regular and you're going to need a half cup of cookies and cream ice cream it doesn't really matter what kind just as long as it's cookies and cream you're going to need one egg a third cup of vegetable oil which is how much it requires on the it just depends on what kind of brownie mix in that and then instead of using water we're going to be using the fudge and ice cream so you need about a half cup of a fourth cup of punch so the first thing you're going to need to do is pre-heat your oven according to what the box says in mine says 325 so that's the first thing you need to do and then you need to spray your pants and the cake mixes a stick and then before you cook anything any always you need to wash your hand okay now first you take your cake mix and pour that into a bowl next you're going to need to put in most of your ingredients first we need to put in your vegetable oil next step is your one cracked egg so you use the ingredients that are called for on the boxes up you substitute the water for eggs I mean before substitute the water for fudge which was one fourth cup for fudge and ice cream and after the fried you're gonna put in your half cup of ice cream next up before you put any of it anywhere is you gotta mix it all together it's going to be hard to mix at first because of the bud and the ice cream so it's gonna take a minute but you just have to kind of keep working with it and then after you get this all start up you're going to take your eight by eight pan to make sure you get everything around it or it may work because if the ice cream is like in one spot because it's kind of like frozen then it's not gonna you're only going to have half ice cream in your thing your dessert so you need to make sure it's all mixed in and then after you do that you're going to take your eight by eight you're going to pour about let's say half of this mix in there just so you get like a good layer on there make sure it gets all the way spread pretty thin because it's a layer you have to make sure you get the pretty much the base of the pan cover this is just the first layer and then you're going to take let that sit and then you're like oreos and you're going to line the bottom of the end is the Oreo so you're going to just kind of line them up like I said before it doesn't really matter what kind of Oreos you use as long as they're like chocolate I guess it could it doesn't really matter because it's just like an inside Stefan doesn't matter which way you put San or anything some of the Oreos will kind of like seat and some of them like float it's just because of like where they are in the pan so you just kind of line the first layer with them and then last not last but then you take the rest of your batter got everything on step one more time and then you pour that on top of the Oreos make sure it gets pretty evenly spread over the Oreos or you'll have life it's not later so I'm just like Oreos it can be kind of hard to get out just because it's so thick upon a 10 hit over the Oreos make sure all the oreos get coated to evenly and the good thing about it is mostly it'll spread out a little bit when it gets cooked so it'll cover most the Oreos as long as you get the majority of them covered it'll be pretty good all right so after this we're going to make sure that we get all of them covered one more time and then depending on your size of your pan which I didn't eight-by-eight because that's what you're supposed to use I guess you need to bake um um them for about a pretty long time like 40 minutes almost 45 minutes so I'm going to go ahead and all my ovens not ready yet so so I'm going to go ahead and put them in even though it will get heated and then we're going to put our time work for about 45 minutes and and we'll come back when they're done", "4TEVFbCpsME": "- Have you been searching for\na melt-in-your-mouth cookie that's perfectly sweet with\njust the right note of tang? Say hello to cream cheese cookies, these guys are amazing and\nthey whip up in no time. Hey, you're watching Preppy\nKitchen where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make\ndelicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends. These cream cheese cookies will\nbe ready before you know it, so let's get started. First off, we're adding 1\n3/4 cups of all-purpose flour into a large bowl. That's 210 grams, if\nyou're weighing it out. 1/2 a teaspoon of salt, in you go. And 1/2 a teaspoon of baking powder. Whisk it up. Sift it out. And give it a really quick whisk. Okay, set that aside, and now you can either\napply your stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment or an electric hand mixer in a big bowl, your choice. To this bowl I'm adding\n1/2 a cup or 113 grams of unsalted room temperature butter. And just by the by, room temperature means that\nyou can use your finger to press down with a little bit of force and it will make an indent. This is at the very cooler\npart of room temperature, so I'm gonna give it just a bit of a cream to break it up first. If your butter is just\nlike almost melting, that's too soft, that's\nnot room temperature. (mixer whirring) That's good. Now an equal amount,\nfour ounces, 130 grams, of room temperature cream cheese. This is the magical and primary ingredient in cream cheese cookies. It makes them soft and cakey and just like melt in your mouth, slightly tangy, perfectly\nsweet amazingness. I can't go on enough about these cookies. You know I bake a lot of things, but I've actually been baking\nthese just for pleasure and like giving them out in little boxes, like care packages to go, because I like them so much. They are the best cookie\nfor me at the moment. (mixer whirring) But you know, I play\nfavorites, favorites change. So cream the cream cheese\nand butter up together, and then add one cup, 200 grams, of granulated white sugar. Drop it in there. Let the mixer run, it'll get\nnice and light and fluffy. If you want to, you can\ngive it a little scrape. Scrape, scrape, scrape. These are a great cookie to\nmake with kids, by the way, because they're basically foolproof, just a couple of ingredients and there's like two bowls at work, so it's not gonna be like a crazy cookie. (mixer whirring) All right, I'm gonna add\nin two teaspoons, or 10 ML, of a nice vanilla. And then one room temperature egg. Mix it up. One more scrape. That's good. Now we can dump in the dry ingredients. And a little word to the wise, this is gonna be a very\nsoft, soft cookie dough, but I'm always intrigued\nby soft cookie doughs because you know something\nreally interesting is about to happen. My example for that\nwould be crinkle cookies. Those cookies have to chill overnight and they're still soft, but when you bake them up, they're like liquid balls\nof fudge in the middle and crispy on the outside. They're so good.\n(mixer whirring) Oh my gosh, (mumbles). (mixer whirring) (voice distorts) (mixer whirring) Mix on low. We got excited thinking\nabout the crinkle cookies. Okay, I'm mixing it until almost combined, and I'm just gonna finish it off by hand. Get that paddle out. Is there some elegant way\nto do this that I'm missing? You can let me know in\nthe comments. (chuckles) So, there's some flour on the side, there's some butter on the bottom. Just use your spatula\nand mix the dough in. Yeah, see, look at that stuff\non the bottom, that's unmixed. If you didn't do that, you'd have a couple of cookies that would be really melty\nin the oven and just burn. So my dough is all mixed. This is gonna go into the\nfridge for at least an hour. You could totally make this a day ahead, but an hour should be really fine. I'm gonna warn you, though, that when we put these\non that cookie sheet, your hands will get messy, but it'll be so worthwhile. All right, cover it up into the fridge. We'll be back in a moment\nwith the magic of editing. Okay, my cookie dough has been chilling for a little bit over an hour, I had things to do, and now we're going to portion it out, roll it out and bake it. I just wanna show you the\nconsistency of the dough. So here, look like normal cookie dough, but once you give it a little roll. Oh, that's actually not bad. Thanks, extra chilling time,\nyou made all the difference. All right, things will\nget messy as we go on, I'm just warning you. It's not gonna stay that way. Portion out roughly two\ntablespoon-sized pieces, it could be a little\nbit bigger or smaller, and just give it a really quick roll just to bring it together so\nit's more of a cookie shape. I like to use a trigger ice cream scoop 'cause it kind of just\nplops out into your hand, when it works. I will confess to having\nbroken several of these, so know it happens. So roll, roll, roll, and\njust place them down. Give them at least like an inch and a half of distance between them. But they don't spread out very much. When you bake these cookies\nup, they look a little homely. They're not like a beautiful\nshortbread cut cookie or like some assembled\nmacaroon or something. So I feel kind of guilty\ngiving them to people, but they're so delicious. I always hope they'll\nsee beyond the outside and taste the cookie. Here's a box of ugly cookies\nI baked you. (chuckles) Okay, wash your hands and\nthen pop these into the oven. 375 for about 10 minutes. They might not seem\ndone, but they're done. So the edges will be a little bit brown. You can give them an extra\nminute if you need to. But they'll continue setting after they come out of the oven. They'll be like really just\nmelt-in-your-mouth amazing. After about 10 minutes in the oven, your cookies are gonna\nlook just like this, like beautiful little\ncream cheese pillows. Place them onto a wire rack\nto finish cooling completely and, well, give them a few\nminutes before you do that. Let them rest on your baking sheet first. Now you can finish them off with just a really light\ndusting of powdered sugar. You might need a tablespoon\nfor the whole batch. It just gives you a little bit of contrast and the tiniest bit of extra sweetness. There we go. Nothing to choke on. I literally used like two teaspoons. There we go. I'm so excited I got to\nshare this recipe with you. It is really one of my\nfavorites right now. And you know if I'm baking\nsomething on the sly and doling it out, it is a must bake recipe. Take a look at the inside. Do you see that? What? Before I take a bite, if you liked this video,\ncheck out my cookie playlist. Tons of cookies of all shapes and sizes. There's basically gotta be\none that you're gonna love, if not all of them. But now it's time for a bite. Hmm. It just dissolves and the\ncream cheese, the sugar, hmm. So good.

moonlight do we need to toast the nuts i don't toast my nuts why not make sure if you do that all the flavor coming from the nuts haha brownies and just get a towel and then you just keep on mixing this flour well i put a lagon for brownies you want it heavy fudgy chocolaty okay and then you fold in the nuts in an oven toaster just to show you that anything is possible as long as you know the basic technique you will survive in the kitchen so is okay i'm going to put half of the batter onto my baking pan and then using my spatula i'm going to even it out [Music] okay i'm going to bake this in the oven toaster for approximately 24 minutes the temperature of the toaster should be around 350 degrees fahrenheit or 175 degrees celsius okay second you see i'm using a small oven okay so i'm going to leave it there [Music] [Music] because again there is no leavening agent well i'm baking soda while i'm baking powder overnight remember [Music] [Music] hitaco after 25 minutes the finished product so after 24 minutes in the oven it's very important that you do not over bake the brownies because if you over bake it so sometimes brownies you will feel that but that's okay because when you let it cool down what you call the carry over baking it makes a big carry over baking once you take it out from the oven simply because and then to show you i'm going to cut slices just use a sharp knife brownie small hindi and busta busta diddy kit okay it means super fuji i don't know you see the inside it's super duper fudgy to show you what's inside very very fudgy and super easy to make super cost efficient i'm going to try it on it see super fudgy super chocolaty i'm going to try it it's also chewy because of the brown sugar and of course what other variations can we make you can do rocky road brownies marshmallow you can even do chopped nut brownies you know the chocolate the popular filipino uh candy chocolate or me isabel so depending on your imagination you can prepare different variations remember when you know you can so i look forward to seeing your uh products your finished products for brownies and let's make use of our time let's be productive and let's make money out of basic techniques that we learn in the kitchen take care everyone and see you again", "N7azQTTXIxo": "you too hey everybody you guys know it is it's cute and you know how I do when I'm

be making chewy no bake cookies and cream bars or we might just be making a big blob of something I'm not really sure it only takes three ingredients which I was like I think I can handle this it says it's a fun snack for children to make I'm not a child but I'm not good in the kitchen I have to blend up all these Oreos until a nice little mess so that's what we're gonna do first easy open pull tab who would have thought it's not so easy toss these in here I don't know just feel like this isn't gonna work so well in the blender but it actually says the blend it like is there an easier way to get these Oreos out we're gonna start with a couple of them so we don't overwhelm the blender how do i blend oh boy is there like a crush cycle we should probably start by plugging it in this is working just as planned get the rest of them in there next step we put five cups of marshmallows into a bowl I don't think we actually need to measure how many marshmallows quite fit in here not that many one two three four ish five throw one in for good luck then we use four tablespoons of butter I have a knife not sure if this knife is for this type of cutting but it's gonna have to cut the notch this is a sharp knife remote this for about a minute and a half or until you know you feel like taking it out all right so while we're here you're supposed to put something in this pan so that it's easy to pull out but I don't have anything I don't have any paper so we're just gonna spray it and hope for the best holy crap these things are puffy whoa all right for this in here oh this is great and now we just stir it all up and float looks like it should look whoops this is messy this is actually really really really messy so once we mix this up we transfer it to the pan this is disgusting I don't think I did this right transfer it recommended using an 8x8 pan I actually had one um okay you're sticking to me having some issues here okay so we just let this set for about 10 minutes now we cut it up into says nine pieces but I might just make it like four there's just so many thinks we can do only wait for our cookies and cream chewy bars we can ride around then get it get right around and get it I'm so sick of seeing everyone else thoughts about these hoverboard monorover thingies but nan they are so fun you can come over we can have deja boo' so I'm gonna have to get off it now ah I put her in the fridge for a little bit because I don't like to wait I don't wanna wait for my bars to be cool alright so like I said this was supposed to make nine bars so I guess we just cut it into threes pull these little ones look real gooey and good I think there's one of your best bet for trying to get this thing out or it might be our worst bet I'm not sure actually yet cheese my hands and just pick it I just want it to look nice I feel like this cooking segment should be called how to be subpar in the kitchen being less than average they're very yeah definitely need the cooking paper yeah they're way too greasy I put too much cooking spray in alright here we go mmm it's really good it tastes like marshmallow butter and Oreo cookies alright guys dream haven't we made no big chewy cookies and cream bars and it only took like 10 15 minutes which isn't bad at all no bake just how I like it I'll put the rest of you down in the description thanks for watching and uh make sure you subscribe your whatever I'll see you guys next time", "LhaZJKtA6lE": "[Music] you [Music]", "hoNa4bIQyL8": "wasting my time laying on the couch looking for motivation to get up and do something

is measures that was brownies I really hope that this works I really do but I'm sure it'll taste good either way so yeah here it is fresh out the oven I don't know what to think maybe I should have

two baking chocolate with a half a cup of butter once the chocolate is melted we're going to go ahead and set it aside until it's cold next in large bowl you want to beat your eggs add in your sugar and vanilla now we're going to stir in the cooled chocolate mixture it's really important that your chocolate is cool because you don't want to cook your eggs okay the next step we're going to take our baking soda we're gonna quickly add it to our flour mixture pour it into our chocolatey mixture we're gonna stir it up we've got a greased 8x8 inch pan here then after we mix this up we're gonna pour it in while it's cooking Vicki's gonna make one of the toppings so we'll be all set to go in a bowl stir in the coffee granules into the cream I'm gonna boost that up butter and our powdered sugar okay the brownies have cooled and now we're going to spread on the coffee cream layer I'll try and get it to the edges too because when it's cut it'll be nice to see that okay now I'm gonna make our top layer or ganache what I've got here are some semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of doing in a saucepan today I'm just going to go ahead and pop them in a microwavable Cup I'm gonna add my cream and we're gonna go ahead and warm it up in thirty-second increments in the microwave okay with melted chocolate in the microwave with us we knew that was so I've got it and you know I'm just gonna actually pour it on and you know maybe Vicki if you'll tilt the pan okay you sure that part oh yeah that's easy and kind of give it a nice even coating so this is an 8 by 8 inch pan and this should make just about a dozen square coffee creamer Ami's so I'm gonna let that set up and then we're gonna go ahead and slice them okay the brownies have partially cool we couldn't no no well you can do it either way I guess yes where we can say you can either have them perfectly cut and clean more than kind of gooey gooey drizzly and these might be gooey drizzly so we're gonna give it a try they're gonna be delicious no matter what yeah they just smell way too good to wait yeah yeah that top layer is still nice and gooey actually it should be more setup but like we said we couldn't wait it looks pretty good and we could have waited but we couldn't wait we could where they could just look at all that icing that's part of whipped cream on here lay by lending together I wish I could

"QYeq3PPAkxU": "hey guys Dave from cook and tare here today's recipe is no baked white chocolate Oreo balls believe me guys these are no frills but nevertheless super delicious you're gonna love them so let's get started I've got a couple of sleeves of Oreo cookies here and this is about all I'd say a hundred and thirty seven grams so what we're gonna do is add these to a ziploc bag and just kind of break them up and you can use a food processor or whatever method you feel comfortable with just until they're broken up and nice and crumbly next we're gonna add in about 113 grams of cream cheese and you're gonna want to make sure this is a room temperature otherwise it's gonna be really hard to work with so I'm just gonna start combining this with a wooden spoon then move to an electric mixer because it makes life a whole lot easier I'm gonna mix this until I get a semi smooth sandy mixture something like this after that what you want to do is snag up oh I'd say a heaping teaspoon pull place it into the palm of your hand and simply roll it into a bowl okay we're going to set these on a baking tray lined with some parchment paper and put them in the freezer for about 15 minutes just to set well the cookies are setting don't forget to click subscribe and you'll never miss a video so what I have here is about 2 cups of semi-sweet white chocolate I suppose you could use almond bars as well that would be really nice too and I'm gonna melt this down in a bowl over some soft oil and water now this is just kind of a makeshift double boiler this is going to take somewhere in the neighborhood of about four or five minutes you could microwave this to just take a look on the back of the bar for instructions now the chocolate is melted down remove it from the heat take your Oreo balls out of the freezer insert a toothpick into the center dip them into the chocolate and I'm just going to take a spoon here and spoon that gooey gooey goodness over just so they're completely covered after that set them on the parchment paper once again sprinkle a few Oriole crumbs over them and let them sit for a few minutes just to harden and there you have it are no-bake white chocolate

frosting and you can find the recipe for that on my website or in the description down below now I'm using a plain round tip nozzle and I'm doing I do not swirl so that means that we have a bit of a

"hey everyone welcome to mg screaming today we are making oreo cheesecake brownies which is a decadent four layer dessert that consists of a layer of brownies followed by a layer of book original and golden Orioles then we have a layer of cheesecake followed by some Orioles crumbled on top is great it is all the things that I've wished for so right here we have some fudge brownies I'm going to use box brownies today you can make your own but I figured why not I'm going to add some instant coffee and we're just gonna mix this all around I have some vegetable oil right here two eggs and some water and we're just gonna mix this up in retrospect I see I should have used a bigger bowl but you know I've committed and so we're just going to use this one right here you could use your mixer but I'm overdue for an arm workout so games so easy make sure you scrape down the sides and turn from the bottom so you get any dry ingredients that are left down there so I have a 9 by 13 pan here and parchment paper and now I'm actually going to spray just a little bit over the top of the parchment its aside we're just going to pour our brownies in some Oreos on this layer here and I have both of the original Oreos in the voting DeLorean so we're just going to lined up a hook lacrosse like every other thing going on we're going cheese I'm gonna just cut this open drop that down in there and we're gonna get for all three of these buckets up my handheld mixer you know I've never named my handheld mixer mostly this is not really - my mom's not so weird so weird using the handheld mixer I don't know its name it's strange feeling use mixer to beat our cream cheese guys it just feels so impersonal like I just don't know anyway Center sugar Bobby what is with the mixer ebony Barlow mow her lawn Ruben [Music] all right so I have two eggs and some vanilla and we're just going to throw this on low it looks nice [Music] cheesecake like what we're going to do now it's spread our cream cheese can caution over our Oreos set this over here look okay about to crush up some Oreos so get ready to you know stretch it out but good stuff cherry pickers or primitives you need to do see if you let out that aggression alright we're gonna sprinkle over top of this that's like that's enough vanilla here we're coming it with our original Oreos this is gonna be super decadent I have my oven preheated to 325 degrees Fahrenheit I have it on convection so I'm about to pop this in and I will see you guys and like I don't know give me a few minutes to bacon and let it cool and then we'll reconvene all right so our oreo cheesecake brownies have been in the oven they have cooled and so now I'm gonna try to successfully get them out of this pan this is why I left the parchment paper on this side I took a knife and I kind of went along the sides to try to break up anything that might have stuck that actually came out quite nicely I'm just going to cut these into bars you can't tell me that doesn't look bomb so I'm not going to put this in the refrigerator fill in a while so it can part in just a little bit so it's more of that cheese pink light consistency but other than that from what you just saw me taste you know that it's amazing I don't even want to know how many calories any of these bars are gonna be whose I'm gonna be huge but I'm gonna be happy and you'll be happy

sticks of butter ready to go for me I'm going to add some heavy cream a couple teaspoons of pure vanilla extract and then some powdered sugar mix it together now that we've got our frosting all whipped up I'm gonna add the chocolate cream sandwich cookies I don't want to call them Oreos because I'm using new minoes they are preservative free additive free Oreos taste like very metallic to me now that I'm used to having ones that are all-natural I always try to cook and bake preservative free I don't kill myself over it but I do the best I can because I mean why shouldn't we be healthy so I'm just gonna take up mallet to it and get them all nice and crumbly that's good just gonna add them straight in to our frosting then just fold them in your cuties and cramps now that I've got it all mixed up and it looks so good I'm gonna frost the cake take pictures and then eat some I process my cake and it took a long time I really don't like frosting cakes good this cake mix I wanna you have to make this cake I swear you will love it it is the ultimate ultimate ultimate cookies and cream cake and even better it is as preservative-free as we can get making a cake this delicious if you

"o63SuRc7Jsk": "what up keto fam dj keto here where i vlog myself cooking keto friendly dishes and today we'll be doing a product review i'll be making some snickerdoodle cookie and a batch of brownies so that sounds good to you go ahead and give this video a thumbs up but first bulletproof coffee [Music] okay so my wife went to our local bargaining grocery store and she found these zen sweet cookie mix and brownie mix they're pretty simple to make looks like this takes only one egg and four tablespoons of butter and contains 12 servings each cookie is gonna roughly be about three net carbs per cookie and brownie too need to mix unsweetened yogurt with this and this is going to be about six net carbs per brownie let's whip these up and give it a try so we're going to start with the sneaker doodle cookies we'll set the brownie one aside for now instructions are pretty simple i have the oven preheated at 350 so we need to mix four tablespoons of melted butter and one egg whisk this up and then add the mix [Applause] smells really good the cinnamon comes out real [Music] well this looks pretty well mixed we're going to transfer it to a cookie sheet i got my non-stick mat on it and it says to scoop up one tablespoon per cookie got this little ice cream scooper we'll use [Music] okay cookies are done i baked them at 350 i had to increase the time four more minutes so a total of 14 to 15 minutes before i stuck them in the oven i did smash them down a little bit um it smells really good but uh we will let this cool for a couple minutes while this is cooling we'll start on the brownie mix now for the brownies all we need is the packet instruction says one cup of unsweetened yogurt we'll mix this together the yogurt's really interesting never done this before here's how this will come out so this came out pretty interesting it looks more of a cookie dough cookie dough than brownie dough um so i will just throw it in it says an 8x8 pan but i have this brownie pan that i'm going to use i'm going to give it a quick spray add the brownie mix it says the packet has 12 servings in it so this brownie pan has this little pre-cut 12 pieces into it i'm just gonna spray it down so it doesn't stick to it i have my oven preheated to 350 degrees we will stick this in for about 25 [Music] minutes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay keto fam we're all done baking let's give these a try first the cookies they came out pretty well doesn't like the picture though let's try them good cinnamon flavor it's made with monk fruit so it doesn't have that cooling after taste i like it i would definitely buy this again now let's try the brownies these are these look really interesting interesting texture not really fudgy doesn't really have a very strong chocolate flavor to it you know it's really not that bad i think if i were to add some of my own chocolate chips to it that'd be really good it's really not that bad i would actually buy this one again too yeah i would probably give these about seven out of ten my honest review would i buy it again i think i would buy both of these again i think it's convenient on time simple to make simple ingredients definitely pick up a pack if you come across it hope you enjoyed this video if you haven't already go ahead subscribe if you want to see more videos like this

now got our brownie mix you're going to put into a piping bag the red velvet mixing into a jug and then we going to lay them up inside of our Barton but Barton Luther King not very much like him like bar Tina Navratilova know if you haven't got one of those Barton Simpson no if you haven't got one of these you can do it a regular cab aren't a lot of bars afterwards oh afterwards okay with an even layer of each they go into an oven at 180 degrees for 20 minutes the browning the red velvet mingle let them bake until you've got 12 individual cake bars and then let them cook while those bake and cool we can make our Oreo frosting and chocolate ganache wanna split screen it again yes Ben I'd love to tear the icing sugar butter and cream put it into a bowl and whip it up to it's light and fluffy then crack in 6 Oreo cookies this is the best thing I've ever seen so the ganache pull the cream over the chocolate and melt it in a microwave till it's just melted then whisk in the butter excited to be nice Steven even we've done a great job here we have done a very good job we have cooked and cooled our little bars we've got our Oreo frosting and ganache ready to go can I show you the next step you can you can leave them just like this they're quite dainty dusting icing sugar job done you can see the brown in the bottom the red velvet on top or slice off the lid to give us room for frosting and there we go and then the base part goes back into our tin we pipe some of the frosting on top then the ganache repeat 12 more times and put it back in the fridge but an hour offset hey look at those anything that's it no way we're gonna sprinkle the top with freeze-dried raspberries and crushed Oreos oh you crushed the Oreos yeah why are you chopping it like when sprinkling raspberry always focus on technique let's go for it oh cool heads really good the smooth Dan - I love the taste of ganache Gooden they're all up in my grill I was delicious a lot Brown at this time

comment the week and I hope forgot a few more than five seconds to run through this one this made me chuckle okay so this is based on last week's video when you guys cook for me in particular you're Leicester Square cheese then wrapped in foil yeah so been knuckly said I'm really confused first you said you use tinfoil hmm then you said take out the oven and remove the silver foil but to me they both look like aluminium foil so which element did you actually use with earth science jokes the science geeky joke love that that is a good point and you're gonna drop the periodic table symbols in over that everyone knows what talking up we show what I think that fridge cam had everything they had Oreos it had perfect pasta it had taste explosion and it had very little of Barry and Jamie

most of that stuff hmm", "3RzYy8k2sSE": "hi I'm Lisa Martin with pampered chef and welcome to my Kido kitchen I'm going to be showing you what we're going to be doing with the brownies that we made earlier so we made the keto brownies homemade I got this beautiful thing for my husband for Mother's Day and Easter and I am so excited to have this beauty but what I put it to is so they came out nice and thick look how thick that is and I'll taste one but I want to cut them up first what you do is what we're gonna do is we're gonna cut them in half we're gonna make a cream to go inside and we're gonna have ice cream sandwiches with the weather getting so nice you kind of want ice cream and there's really not a whole lot out there without a lot of preservatives in it and if you're gonna eat that you may as well eat the other kind with preserve I'm trying to do better so I went and got me I made this up and it is so good and what you freeze it and then that's what makes it like an Ice Cream Sandwich and I've made these before but I bought a pint so what we're gonna do is use a pint of it I'm gonna put it in this beauty right here and first I got to put them yes this is so nice cuz you choose these for a long time went and spoiled me with it and then mine came with this so it doesn't splatter all over here when you're putting things in it's so thick down and then lock it into place and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put this on and start pouring this sound sometimes it's just better to get it already pre-measured it's quick and fast okay then to sweeten it up I'm going to use 3/4 of a cup of sweetener and you just use sweetener of your choice the port I love this for three-quarters of a cup in it I don't think I could do without this and I'm just gonna slowly put this in here so it makes this better I'm gonna increase up just a little bit you start make them to ice cream you can put chocolate in this you can flavour this with any kind you can put chocolate chips in this you can put fruit in here there is so much that you can do with these but what I've done is I've cut some of these inky like the like so you cut them in half just kind of eyeball it they're soft because they just come onto the ovens so they are a little hard to handle if you get some that crumble on you because you didn't save it because we'll have extra of this that you can use and just make like a put it in the bowl I need it that way it's good that like take a taste just to make sure [Music] I wish you could smell my kitchen right now when Brown in the hamburger so they just made their browning just came out ldren we're making the whipped cream of the ice cream type thing but like I say you can do all kinds of things [Applause] [Music] and some people say I bought this cookies you pour it into it and it makes your icecream scream like this tastes just like cookies and clean try it out you might want to get it and use it at WestEd you know so I'm going to try it today we'll try it they said you only need a couple guys and it's going to change the color of course that's ok look like chocolate if one is good surely to and you don't overbeat it you just avoided this make it other Nexus [Music] one of the get stripped this could've come at a better time and I've been wanting one but they're very very it's getting very fun so flavor well I see what I get to eat later did you ever do that when you were small eat the beaters we always stood in line for the beaters okay and I'm still learning how to do all this so I'm just gonna show you this locks in place but look how nice they come out okay let me try it with this chocolate mmm that it's called milk magic cookies and cream you've got to try it that's awesome it gives it a chocolate batter okay and I'm gonna take the bottom see the bottom [Music] see how it is and then you're gonna put the top on like so and then when I get done with these I'm going to wrap them in plastic and put them in the freezer and it takes about about two hours for it to freeze but boy do you have a good treat okay and you have to be careful cuz they're not probably next time that what I'm gonna do is probably put them in the fridge and let them you know harden up a little bit just in the fridge and then they'll be easier to scoop but that's all you do look how nice of an ice-cream sandwich that makes and like I say when it's frozen they are so so good you'll have to try that please give me a thumbs up like my videos and subscribe and have a great day", "Vj6X_330RHs": "hello PO a lemon you pop unpaid incoming fire and

show big scoop of you is a new channel being set up still early days but it's getting better every single time as I get bit more confident I'm saying as I start to learn a bit more about protein and yeah as you can see all of this stuff is slowly growing in size and I've got stuff here and in here I'm going to show some pictures at some point of all the stuff i actually have it's a lot ha be honest um so basically the idea is I take an item and take a supplement and take protein whose I review it a review on different scales for different things everything really I was scripting some of it but I'm doing a lot more winging it now because I found myself staring at the script down the bottom which means there's a lot more mistakes there was some already but there was a lot more so today I'm going to I got up like I'm overusing really really interesting um I this is my full time job my full time job is a system manager in a coffee shop and when you're wearing off you sure are politically all you see all the time is cakes and brownies and stuff like that and I came across these on muscle tues this is Lenny and Larry's or natural muscle brownies now this is I saw these i had to jump on the opportunity they look incredible i'll be honest i love brownies it's difficult for me to work on place where they sell valleys without wanting to eat them this way i can actually finally eat them without feeling completely guilty obviously I might die I tend to work with it fits in your macros I'm not the best way but it's a way that I keep saying well do yeah why got these now so I don't feel so bad on a two-year now the macros on it are high and good right so for one of these you have two servings in it so I'm just going to say now this is two servings I know a few people we've ate it and read it is one serving and then din tally up to their macros and make them match so right now I'm doing for one serving double it for two servings which is a whole pack right so you have a hundred seventy calories so that is 335 values for the whole thing um Snow White at all is it I can't do math that's 340 calories for the whole bar five grams of fat so that's 10 grams for the whole bar carbohydrates 42 grams that's 44 whole thing 24 half so that's 40 grams of carbs that is a lot of carbs but this is a once a week treat I would say you know this is yes I really want this way now I'm craving chocolate I can't have it yes perfect dirty fiber one gram sure 11 grams protein 20 grams so half the whole thing is 20 grams a whole thing a half of one is 10 grams which is really good a lot of protein a lot of carbs a lot of fat but again it's a little treat I am I wouldn't say eat one of these every day have one now and again just teaching yourself so how do you know these guys I haven't had active unfortunately I got them for muscle foods price percent on muscle foods is one pal 93 4 10 which is good that is for one whole cake so just going to hook this up and do a try so costs are throwing the said to the man clean and so yeah crossbow 719 for you so new that four or five it's good it's about the same as quest same as the quest bars about the same value be nutrition cuz of those high carbs three out of five but again it's a tree and something you have when you need it when you one that will sweet and fitting bit down easy to grab your fitting your macros it's not a problem you're gonna have as much as you want but i think the way it is it's just a treat for you one day hmm i'm on investor day I was like I pop my house already but what have my carbs already but on a training day yeah usually I him so I'm a certain nutrition that main taste now these have only just been delivered to me in a box and a had ice in it now I don't know if that's made them a little bit harder no they should be softer so maybe that's something i'll look at i'm going to eat them again if the consistency is changed but why now three hour five oh good that's soft but now not why brownies how many more but poaching on the go fill them in the bag now fine especially if you re busy day trying to get a lot done it's a really good dream that's film 40 calories than your bag you need to pick up with everyone so for that museum it's really good so over then give this a 3.5 out of 5 which is good aim I mean half is oh I was I was you know what he won't show you our film and you're really am really hug gunfire but you watch that film and it wasn't as good as you were expecting your expectations were high then you have this and excited about it but it just didn't meet expectations that's what I'm looks like with this this is a shame but I'm going to carry on eating it and the outlets haniv well 11 that weight as well here get away box for items in there now

welcome to sugar and spice my name is Melissa Randall from baking with Melissa and today I'm showing you a how-to on layered whipped cream brownies before I started I went ahead and made my brownies in advance let your brownies cool completely and while they're cooling you can work on your different layers for the brownies first we're gonna start off with 8 ounces of softened cream cheese and 2 cups of powdered sugar and you'll go ahead and mix the two of those together until it's nice and smooth you'll know it's done when it's nice and smooth and creamy inside once you have that all mixed together you're going to add in one cup of whipped topping and you're just gonna fold that into your mixture mixing that up they're not beating it I'm just kind of folding it in and now what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and layer that on to the already cold brownies so take our mixture place it right on the brownie and spread then you're gonna go ahead and make your pudding mixture which I've already made mine and basically all I did was used one instant chocolate pudding mix and I just made it according to the package directions which just basically says mix it with two cups of milk and then you'll just put it in the refrigerator while you're spreading this on top so you'll just put that in the refrigerator for just a few minutes to let it congeal just a bit and then you're gonna pour some of the pudding right on top of the cream cheese layer I already took my brownies out of the pan so I'm gonna have a little bit of drip drip action going on that's all right now you'll just place the remaining whipped topping on the top and go ahead and spread it evenly now what you want to do is put this in the refrigerator for a couple of hours to really let it firm up and that way when you cut into it you'll see all the nice layers and that is a how-to on layered whipped cream brownies thank you so much for joining me here today on sugar and spice my name is Melissa Randall from baking with melissa and i hope you have a wonderful baking day you", "lIb_741_dIw": "[Music] Oh [Music]", "WPMKeGO-AQU": "hey I'm Alex and today I'm going to show you how to make my cookies and ice cream dump cake so this recipe I came up with based on two things one I wanted to make some sort of a dome and two I wanted to use Oreos on the outside to make a really cool visual so I knew this recipe would naturally be cookies and cream flavored because I was using Oreos but I wasn't quite sure which middle of the thing I wanted to do cheesecake it could have done an ice cream cake but I decided those ice cream cake because it was kind of nail and also I just really love cookies and cream ice cream cake that's my favorite kind of cake it's what I have my birthday usually fun fact so I melted down the cream Center in order to put it back into the ice cream base that we're gonna make which I might add is my favorite part of the Oreo fun fact another fun fact this video is full of a bunch at so the base is made out of more like a whipped cream and the sweetened condensed milk and it still freezes up and holds up like an ice cream line but just a little lighter I would say that's like creamy then an ice cream would be crushed cookies will go in there also when you're whipping the cream you want to make sure you get it to the point where it's thick but don't whip it too much because then it'll separate so based on the size of your bowl it might vary how many cookies you put in the actual bullet stuff but don't worry just put them in until they line in the full bowl now some people might want to line their bowl with plastic wrap in order to get the dome cake out easier but you actually don't need it it will pop out on its own the tricky part about this recipe was when I was testing it sometimes the cookies would float up and not stay in place so the batter had to be thick enough to be able to hold the cookies down Ben wants to make your ice cream base you'll dump that right on top of the cookies and spread it evenly to cover all cookies this isn't like a traditional ice cream this is more like a frozen mousse kind of thing but it's super delicious and super easy just pop it in the freezer and wait until it's done you don't want to pull this out early cuz you will have a big mess and also you just really want to make sure it's frozen solid so you'll be able to pop it out of the bowl easily just flip it over on some sort of a board and wait until it kind of loosens up and it should fall right out and then you'll have this beautiful Oreo lined ice cream cake the most important part of this was making sure I nailed that beautiful outside uniform layer and to say it looked pretty cool also what's nice is that the cookies kind of soften up because of the ice cream so you'll be able to cut into this pretty easily I think this recipe is great for like a kid's birthday party because what kid doesn't like ice cream cake and also it's so fun looking make it for your birthday party whether you're three or ninety-six I'm sure you'll still love it this is once you don't you don't go home to point out [Music]", "1NapHNqPAgQ":

our all-purpose flour go ahead and throw that in there together and just whisk it around I should have use a bigger bowl with something in this tiny LeBeau y'all know I don't know alright so going to set that aside in a large bowl we're going to add in some melted butter we're gonna throw in some sugar and then we're going to add in a big ol plop a brown sugar brown sugar makes chocolate chip cookie so moist and chewy I like that so go ahead and add that brown sugar in there stir it up until it's well combined and then add in your eggs we're going to throw in a little bit of vanilla extract to give it a nice little flavor go ahead and mix it up until it's combined I love that this recipe this part anyway does not require a mixer I can just mix it up with my whisk and my spatula love that okay no one's going to add our dry ingredients into our wet ingredients and stir it up until it is well combined that flour is well incorporated in the dough starts to form just like this that's perfect now we're going to work on making our cheesecake layer I'm going to add some softened cream cheese into a bowl I let it sit out to soften up really good then we're going to throw in some sour cream I really like when cheesecake has sour cream in it the texture is like perfect when you add sour cream to Cheesecake love it now we're going to put in that beaten egg we're going to mix it up until it is combined really well and they're going to add in some vanilla extract you can really just mix all these cheesecake ingredients up into a bowl at one time and it will come out perfect we're going to add in some powdered sugar to sweeten it up but not too much this isn't really sweet because of chocolate chip cookies that those two layers really don't need a lot of sweetness so there you go nice and silky beautiful and now let's start putting this bar together I have prepared my baking pan by lining it with parchment paper we're going to take half of that dough and just press it down into our pan into a nice even flat layer oh my gosh you guys next time I'm gonna use like brownie for the bottom part they'll be so good having like a brownie crust oh my gosh but today we're using this um cookie dough crust go ahead and sprinkle on some chocolate chips in a little even layer this is optional but you know so good and then we're going to spread on our cheesecake layer pop it on spread it out until it's nice and even just like that we're going to add some chocolate chip to the remaining dough go ahead and fold those in and then just go ahead and take this dough and just kind of sprinkle it over the top of that cheesecake layer it is kind of sticky but I don't know it's kind of fun doing this part going to sprinkle it into all the Cheesecake layers layer is covered up and they're gonna sprinkle it with some more chocolate chips because you know we're gonna be not a much will be really not a you know I'm saying we're going to bake this at 325 for about 35 minutes when it comes out of the oven go ahead and let it sit until it is completely cooled off and then throw it in the fridge for at least three hours I did overnight and try your best not to dig into it I was tearing this stuff up at nighttime you I couldn't wait then go ahead and cut it into little bars they're so cute look at that I love those layers yep even though these bar cookies are served cold they are still the cookie part is still so soft and chewy I love that grab yourself a glass of milk and you will have a little piece of heaven I promise you they are so good as always you can find the recipe on my blog at DeWitt simcom with a ton of other recipes so going over there and check it out thank you guys so much for watching bye", "lJBhz8OpCb4": "one thing that I realized about red velvet cakes is that is literally only red velvet because you use red dye when someone asked me for our velvet cake I was like I just totally like opened my mind because I never really liked red velvet cake until I realized it's literally a light chocolate cake and that sounds amazing to me it's just the fact that I was so used to red velvet so if you can make a red velvet cake you can make a pink velvet and a blue velvet and orange above it and you really don't need a difference in recipes so I'm gonna show you guys that amazing and very very simple recipe for Blue Bell that cake I'm actually going to make this in a large batch so if you guys are into seeing how I would do larger cakes how I'm like setting it up I pretty much just quadruple the recipe and make it happen please subscribe to the channel if you haven't done so yet I know some of you haven't because I saw it in the numbers I saw it in my analytics please subscribe for the channel where I saw in the notification bell that will help me so very very very very very very very much very much it will help me so much so so if you really want to support us then there's Ning all right I'm a follow through you can do with like a truth and let's get started here are all of the ingredients that I'm gonna use for my delicious blue velvet cake as you can see I have loads of eggs like I said I quadrupled this recipe and they are in water so that they get nice every temperature I also have both of my babies and my mixers here and I'm going to first add the butter now as you can see I'm using two different attachments one of the attachments the one of my blue mixer has a scraper attached to it and then the other one doesn't so this is really kind of cool just to see how much a beater attachment with a rubber piece really helps out I'm doing my typical creaming method of starting off with the butter letting that mix for about three or four minutes and then adding in my sugar and next I'm going to add my eggs one at a time [Music] the bowl on the right definitely needs to be scraped down and I'm gonna go ahead and do the same for the bowl on the left also I felt like this was a competition between old school and new school because the one on the right even though they're both Kitchen Aid mixers that one's like older and my grandmother gave it to me and I was my first mixer and yeah so we're going to allow for that to mix I like a nice alone theme mixing just to get everything nice and fluffy and that right side has to catch up to that left side quick so now I have my oil and I put a little bit of gel dye in there this is the royal blue gel dye by will and I put my gel dye in there thinking okay it'll all mix together I'll just add everything in you know together I'm also adding in my cocoa powder I'm trying to mix everything and I can't really tell if the blue is completely mixing into the oil we are now turning this into a Couture science experiment so once everything is completely fluffy and pale in color I'm going to begin to add my oil and cocoa powder and gelled our mixture now as you can clearly see there is no glue in the bowl no blue in the bowl there's no blue in the bowl so it must be at the bottom of the cup clearly Gela dye and oil does not mix but we definitely know that cream mixes with everything actually I did half-and-half I like to do half and half in my cakes instead of just plain milk you can definitely use whole milk if you would like I feel like the more fat the better so I always just happen has if there's an Aquarius out there whose favorite color is not either blue or white or silver please comment because you're a rare and I just want to know if you're out there for all of my cakes I always make cake flour now it's not necessary in this recipe however if you want you to be nice and light and fluffy try to turn it into a cake flower gonna add my flour about one cup at a time in each bowl and then I'm going to begin my mixer again and look at this Cookie Monster half-and-half mixture that this looks so gorgeous oh my goodness look at the swirl we're gonna add in the milk or the half-and-half whatever you decide to use alternately with the flour so a little bit of flour mixing then some of that liquid then more flour mixing and then more of the liquid and so on and so forth now you do want to add your gel die early in the mixing process because you definitely don't want to have to over mix the cake just to get into a nice blue color [Music] now this was so much cake batter that I had to use a huge 10 quart pot to put all of it into so that I could combine the two batters and everything would come out the same for cupcakes bake these in a 350 degree preheated oven for about 17 minutes for an eight and nine inch cake go ahead pre-heat your oven to 350 and this will bake for about 25 to 30 minutes just keep watch make sure that however long you bake your cake a knife inserted to the center comes out nice and clean if it's too runny I just like to put a little piece of foil over the cake so that it doesn't get any browning so I turn these into velvet cupcakes with cream cheese frosting and I also did an anniversary cake which will be in a separate video so I hope that this helped you guys out guitar in a blue velvet cake bye cake niece's I do have a video on how I decorated this cake which was into a 40 and I'll put the pictures of the couple into each cupcake which I did not get a picture of so disappointed to myself always take pictures of everything that you do is your portfolio of work I am so upset that I do not get that picture let me know if you have any questions for me I will be so happy to answer them I am always here for you cake niece's always once again please subscribe and

it's different than I would love to make it I'll see you guys soon bye cake nieces [Music]", "oI-Wy3mxJu0": "[Music] hi guys I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I want to share with you a delicious a brownie recipe it is a cookie dough Oreo brownie situation I love me a brownie this is the thing though at this time of year okay it's sort of like it's an in-between time for baking for cooking in general so it's a lot of comfort food because it's pretty much the most exciting thing that happens between January and April so we're doing a lot of brownies we're doing a lot of like you know indulgent comfort foods very soon we're gonna have all the berries and all the colors and all the light fare so while we are in these few months we're going to indulge and I can't think of a better way than with this brownie recipe it is very very very easy we're gonna make the cookie dough first of all I have the oven preheated to 350 9 by 13 inch pan ready let's make the cookie dough super simple you need butter regular sugar and brown sugar and I'm going to go ahead and cream this up now for the brownie I bought a brownie mix and I mix it according to package directions it's easy and sometimes I just feel like going that route I think it's always better to even keep some on hand if you can find them for sale just cause it makes things really quick and easy but if you want to make a homemade brownie layer then I have about 1,000 176,000 brownie recipes on Laura in the kitchen that compliment you can use for a base but a transparency reasons it's cheap and when you layer everything really well it makes a phenomenal brownie situation so I'm going to just go ahead and cream these together I'm gonna go ahead and add some eggs these are our beautiful eggs from our backyard I gotta take the show out though because I just got them in there there we go and it could splash of vanilla as well and then you're just gonna cream them together again until creamy and well combined very easy very simple I think if you're gonna if you're gonna take some help from the store take help and buying your brownie mix and then make it according to package directions but make your own cookie dough because I just don't think store-bought cookie dough taste the same as homemade cookie dough so if I'm gonna be spending the time I'm gonna spend it on the homemade cookie dough layer but hey if you want to buy cookie dough at the store so that you really don't have to do a lot of work you do you boo and then at this point I just switched to a spatula cuz it's much easier so what I've got in here is all-purpose flour a little bit of baking soda and some salt and then we're gonna have some chocolate chips and I'm just gonna go ahead and fold this all together using a spatula just add your cookie dough to your prepared pan and now you're gonna have to press this in and it's really sticky obviously so what I find really easy is that if you have a little bowl with some flour to flour your hands it will keep the cookie dough from sticking too much you see I'm just kind of like go back into the flour when you need to and then just sort of keep doing it until you have a thin layer cookie dough then you're just gonna double whammy on the cookie layer with a layer of Oreos okay and then you just take the brownie batter and you just kind of pour this all over the top and you do your best to kind of put it you know make it even and then you just sort of spread it around when you're done pouring it in this is so good this is so perfect for like a birthday party or some thing if you want to do like one special tree phenomenal let's get it all out of there don't make yourself crazy if little places or peeking through because it's all gonna even out in the oven I'm just gonna wash my hands I'm gonna pop these into a 350 degree oven for about 40 to 45 minutes you just want to make sure that the brownie layer is fully cooked through and you let them cool completely then we slice and we serve I am excited all right so brownies were in the oven for about 40 minutes now it's something that I wanted to mention that I didn't the time this takes to bake will vary depending on the brownie mix that you're using so for what I used today it took about 40 min I can 35-ish minute but if your brownie mix says that it'll take about 25 minutes four and nine by 13 and that's how long I'm gonna want to cook it for so that's what I did I just cooked it according to what my instructions told me I just let me show you okay let me see if you can see it you get there it is there it is I'm trying to get you to see an Oreo Wow I cut them like perfectly each one hasn't there it is you can see it in there you've got your cookie you've got your Oreo you've got your brownie batter around I mean it is it is even better shot Wow their trifecta of that phenomenal I love that mmm this is what sound crazy dr. sweet obviously it's sweet but you can taste each layer which is important do you deny me otherwise why bother that is phenomenal girl Laura in the kitchen calm you know I have to go in there in the middle that's what I do get the recipe if we just went too much me and I will see you next one bye [Music] you", "1eaNQDQH4oI": "hey guys tracing back and today we'll be making mouth melting chocolate brownies oh no sound yes what do we need to do first we got that going lightly grease I'm 8 X 8 inch by 8 8 by 8 and square pan okay in a medium large bowl mix the honey into the applesauce kiss mix oh honey oh this that's not the apple sauce into the apple sauce then eggs should be doing this the yolks are stored in the ball form but they get squishy I'm gonna squish them cocoa salts the salt and Shake Mix hi she commits cheaptickets ring so it's a Shake Mix I didn't shake I made a pun all right let's mix it all together spoon batter into the pan and bake what 220 from 25 to 30 minutes remove and cool okay today we're going to be using two bread pans so copper batter in each one up to 16 squares one squared equals 138 calcium calories calories and 6 grams of protein half of it in like that's half so basically until it's full and then we'll bake it okay our brownies are done cooking now I'm ready to try there's good okay Trevor with some frosting well it's cookie we also made our frosting recipe and if you want

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] you", "K8O3bpR4mdQ": "[Music] hi i'm aydah i'm a level one chef i'm anthony and i'm a level two chef i think i need like a child size i'm elisa i've been a professional pastry chef for over 20 years [Music] my brownies are a little bit cakey they're just right i like my brownies halfway between cakey and fudgy i probably make this recipe once or twice a month i like a fudgy brownie this brownie recipe i learned back in pastry school and i've been perfecting it ever since [Music] i'm gonna start making brownies i am gonna start with my dry ingredients half a cup of flour just regular all-purpose flour i always weigh my ingredients that way you can always make sure every recipe is consistent every time you make it i just put too much flour in and then a cup of sugar i'm using granulated sugar so i use a regular granulated white sugar and also a dark brown sugar because that will give an extra rich flavor to my brownies i use melted butter because it's already in liquid form we're going to add room temperature butter it's just much easier to incorporate if it's room temperature when i choose my butter i want to make sure that there are no additives in it i'm using a pure butter and organic is always the best and i'm just using my fork to mix see just think of how many calories you're burning right now when you're doing this and then you can eat all of this yourself and it evens itself out creaming together the butter and sugar helps get that cakiness going you're done creaming when it's nice and well mixed together but the butter is also fluffy and kind of sticky while my sugars are incorporating i cracked my eggs into a bowl it's really important that you crack your eggs into a bowl first not directly into your mixture because you never know if little pieces of shell will get inside [Music] that wouldn't be good one nice little touch i like to add is a little bit of almond flavor to my brownies so we're gonna use an ounce of amaretto liqueur now i'm going to add the 3 4 cocoa powder use the best cocoa powder you can find this smells so good i don't pack it or fluff it or anything else i just scoop it in and then level it off i prefer to use chocolate rather than cocoa powder cocoa powder sometimes can leave a granular taste i'm just going to melt some delicious chocolate and high quality butter over a bain maree i want to make almost like a chocolate syrup this will give a really nice texture to my brownie love makes the ideal brownie but also a good mixture if you look at the consistency it's nice and smooth now we're going to mix these together i'm using a hand mixer because i don't want to sit here for 30 minutes and work up a nice sweat i'm using a paddle attachment rather than a whisk because i don't want to whisk in any extra air you have to do it like this like your life depends on it all right very chocolaty one of the best combinations are brownies and caramel so i've decided to make bourbon salted caramel i'm just starting with sugar right into the pan i'm at about 160 degrees and it's turning a nice amber color and i'm going to add butter some heavy cream i add the bourbon right into the mixture the bourbon adds a nice complex flavor and some notes of nuttiness to the caramel i'm going to stick it into the freezer for at least an hour but i have one last step homemade whipped cream is one of the easiest things you can make it has three ingredients heavy cream confectioners sugar and vanilla extract and you whip it in a chilled bowl i know it looks curdled but it's not all right this is some assembly required before we put the batter in i'm going to grease the pan i like to treat my butter like a crayon sometimes i'm just going to make sure that every little nook and cranny is covered by that butter i'm putting it into a pan lined with parchment that's been buttered so it won't stick also going to add just a pinch of flour to coat the butter and then we're going to roll it around i think this just helps everything come out at the end like so that nothing sticks to the sides i'm going to put half of the batter into the pan first i'm just gonna make it even sometimes you'll see people have baked their brownies and it's really uneven and that's usually because they don't use an offset spatula to smooth it out and put the batter in all areas of the pan this is my other little special trick and treat i like to put the chocolate chips right in the middle of the brownie maybe two handfuls yeah maybe a little bit more you get a chip and you get a chip they melt down and that's where you get a little bit more of that fudginess finish it up with the last half i'm going to layer the caramel right on top and i'll show you a special trick so now i'm just using my butter knife and i'm swirling the caramel into the brownie batter i mean if there's a little leftover on the spoon that's not a bad thing now i'm going to bake this for 20 to 25 minutes at 325 degrees 350 degrees for 20 minutes 45 minutes at 350 degrees all right looks good it looks good i'm excited about this they look and smell delicious when can we dig in it's alive i am the queen of brownies i just stand this is this is we're gonna top it with sliced almonds i like a lot of moments and some confectioner's sugar it's more for looks than anything else it's not coming off [Music] bon appetit very very excited with what i've done here i mean that messing with the back you have cakey layers on the bottom and the top you got that nice fudginess in the middle when those chocolate chips all melted down it's awesome you can smell the combination of the caramel with the chocolate and the fresh whipped cream all right let's cut off a bite and try it this is a good brownie i mean wow nice work that's amazing me now that we've seen levels one two and three it's clear that there's a lot of variability when it comes to brownies let's talk about what makes each one unique let's talk about chocolate the form of chocolate that you use is gonna make a difference as to whether you end up with a chewy brownie or a more fudgy brownie i like my brownies really fudgy my brownies are a little bit cakey for a chewy brownie you're gonna go with cocoa powder cocoa powder is processed from the roasted cocoa beans after the cocoa butter has been removed it's pressed into disks and then it's pulverized and you end up with cocoa powder most cocoa powders go through a dutch processing where we add an alkali and that raises the ph so it's less acidic as you raise the ph some of the compounds in the chocolate form pigments that don't have a lot of taste to it so you get a really dark rich color with a more mild flavor you might think of an oreo cookie it's almost black in color it's highly alkalized and it has a really mild soft chocolate flavor if you want a fudgy brownie you use melted dark chocolate like elisa did that has all of the cocoa butter it's going to give you a nice silky dense brownie it's already in liquid form so you don't need to incorporate as much air when you're mixing this will make a really nice fudgy texture unlike cocoa powder which is going to need mixing and hydration in order to work in your brownie it takes a lot of arm work anthony did a combination of the two he used cocoa powder but then he added a layer of chocolate chips in between the batter so he had this middle section that was pretty fudgy kind of an unexpected treat while you're biting into it the flavor profile of these brownies ranged from simple to complex adis was a really simple flavor profile nothing but chocolate it's a brownie it's gonna be eaten anthony did something different he added an almond liqueur i think it just kind of kicks it up a notch which is a really nice complementary flavor to the chocolate he also added almonds on top which really bolstered that almond flavor and added a nice textural component i might have the whole thing just for myself elisa topped her brownies with a bourbon infused caramel similar to the almonds the bourbon adds a nutty flavor and it also has some notes of butterscotch which emphasizes the caramel it's going to be fantastic caramelization is a really interesting and complex non-enzymatic reaction of sucrose which is white sugar breaking down into its component of fructose and glucose which is very very sweet white sugar by itself has just a sweet note as you increase the temperature you lose water and you increase the browning compounds that are expressed in the caramel i'm at about 160 degrees and it's turning a nice amber color and you get these really complex beautiful roasted toasty flavors oh i want to have some more you can make caramel with just white sugar and heat but when you add the heavy cream and the butter it controls crystallization you don't want any granularity or crystallization in your caramel you want it to be smooth and silky no one wants a clumpy brownie when baking the brownies ada used a glass dish while anthony and elisa used metal metal is a good conductor of heat it heats very fast and you'll get a nice crispy edge to your brownies anthony greased and floured his pan this is different than aydah who just greased her pan i don't know what's going on when you add flour to the pan the flour acts like a nuclei where the batter can kind of grab onto the flour and creep up the edges of the dish this results in a thicker brownie on the sides i'm kind of an edge guy myself perfect i am the queen of brownies does it look so pretty smells delicious there's a lot that goes into baking brownies so next time you make them i hope you consider all of these things so you get the perfect brownie for you see you later [Music]", "Z2fleLKVyI8": "hey guys it's Lee and I'm back today with another recipe in my blinged out brownie series if you don't know what that is it's a series where I take a boxed brownie mix judge it up a little or bling it out with some other ingredients and come up with some amazing brownies I will leave a link to that playlist up in the I cards and down in the description box below so that you can find all of the recipes so this time around I'm doing cookies and cream or oreo cheesecake brownies start off with the brownie mix of your choice it doesn't really matter this is not the big 13 by 9 inch pan size although you can use that you just have to adjust the baking times a little bit so I'm just going to prepare it according to the Box directions and I apologize if you can hear my dishwasher going in the background but we needed to run the dishwasher once you have it all mixed up pour it into a 13 by a 9-inch pan that I have sprayed with cooking spray I put some parchment paper in and spray it again this is just to make it easier to get the cooled brownies out of the pan so if I can get the parchment paper to behave while I do this so what I did there is I just wet the parchment paper on the backside of a little and it sticks to the pan better now I can finish pouring this in the next step is to take 12 Oreos twist them in half and place them on top of the brownie mix [Music] and now I'm gonna set this aside while I make the cheesecake part of the recipe to make the cheesecake portion you need 24 ounces of room-temperature cream cheese 3/4 of a cup of white sugar and you're just going to beat those together until they're smooth once you have that combined you're going to add in two eggs and one and a half tablespoons of vanilla I'm just gonna eyeball the second one it's good and blend until combined and then you're going to pour it on top of the Oreos next I'm going to take 10 cookies 10 Oreos and put them in a bag and crush them this is a good time to think about somebody who's annoying you just kidding once they're crushed sprinkle them on top of the cheesecake mixture next take about a half a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips I'm just gonna whoops eyeball this and sprinkle those on the tub now I'm going to put this in a preheated 325 degree oven for about 45 minutes you just want to bake it until the edges start to get golden brown but it's still a little jiggly on the inside it will set as it cools you do not want to over bake it or it kind of tastes rubbery don't ask me how I know that anyway I'll be back when these come out of the oven okay here they are right out of the oven and if you can see I don't know if you can tell there's still a little bit of jiggle in the center that's fine and it's starting to brown around the edges so that's how you know they're done so now you just need to let them cool completely before you cut into them here are the finished brownies don't they look amazing if you try this recipe please take a picture and post it on social media and tag me in it all of my social media accounts are listed below if you like this video give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel you can also find me on Instagram Twitter Pinterest and Facebook at leas home 0 5 thanks for watching bye you", "eqKw5S0f21o": "hello and welcome back redneck snack and fail reviews today is gonna be a a review and Bey a comparison and it'll be pretty fun pretty interesting so it's two products pretty similar both packages new now they fit them around for a little bit I believe I don't know how long but yeah they are Brown both brownies cookies and cream flavored so Drake's brownies which are like Little Debbie brownies I suppose and then it's got like white icing and chocolate cookie crumbles this one reminds me more of what you look out cookies and cream type thing and then this one is a kind of shaped like a ding dong here for hostess of course there's trusty brownies and there are no cookie pieces it's just a white covering and um chocolate drizzle so I don't suppose it's gonna be very much like a cookies and cream type vibe here I think it's just a marketing scheme but we will say and I'm going to open these up and do them first because I have a feeling I will be disappointed which a domino effect should be just as play when the fact is I don't have high expectations on these so yeah not a huge prize up which is fine are dope that's for sure all right gotta has the texture like a Little Debbie cake you would get I suppose which is weird because like this is hostess so pretty cool but a little Debbie's I think or whoever is Little Debbie fault Drake cakes for I used to be a hostess product so that's why Drake cakes has these brownies they're like little babies so let's see what this tastes like I see if it's can overcome the brownie that's within I say this is a disappointing product I'm just looking for the expiration date actually any good December 4 so I have a 9 month shelf life just tastes like a brownie covered in ice - no white chocolate whatever you want to call it well I don't get cookies-and-cream back maybe in a taxi but I don't know now is this a marketing ploy not a great product act I wouldn't really recommend the brownie in general I reckon I'll give that a three it's not the worst thing but I would not tell you to go get it in general doesn't get the flavor right and I don't know how hard it is to find I can't I think I've seen in quite a few places so that's one of things they do they rise it's available but it's not very good maybe the drinks will be better I don't have high expectations on the drapes but I have expectation that it will be better because of what's on the packaging you can see this cookie crumbles but it doesn't look great so we will safe as long as the brownie tastes better and how soon I will be slightly paste which I suspect it will taste better because you know I know a little Debbie brownie one I see one yeah times were hard to distinguish the cookies and cream taste to it but other times it's pretty noticeable and the brownies Moises Rus assistant product that we all know if you if you know who those drink you know but this but what to expect a hostess brownies I don't know I'm going to be very weary when I do a review for the triple chocolate brownies the hostess has overly it's better than less but yeah I got those I'm gonna review those alongside chocolate peanut butter Ding Dongs I believe and then I've got some Christmas themed hostess products as well that I'll have for review but yeah so far this is better than that the icing is better the topping on the ice is better brownies better I wouldn't say this is perfect but it's pretty good now those are harder to find as well compared to DC's are not too hard to find these are hard to find so that'll be a knock on them more than that they're pretty good um Oh 300 calories that's that's a big no-no and I don't get that when this had 180 not by a ways I just might have a harder captain because I've got more of use coming up but my thing is I definitely recommend this one I'll give it a 7 you're not recommending this I gave you 2 3 well I don't exactly know what I'm gonna review later today but I do have things planned in terms of reviews so yeah y'all stick around keep your eyes open and be ready for our next review I hope your Monday is going well if it's

"SpSLRJF0Z2k": "subscribe to Rajshri food and click on the bell icon for more updates while this festive season of course you need to gift a lot of your family and friends so I thought I'll show you a gifting recipe and this is a white chocolate bar cookies and cream let's begin well as you may all know I personally walk a lot with milk and dark chocolate so this in a way is kind of an unusual recipe because possibly this is one of those only times where I use white chocolate and because it's cookies and cream well it sounds very complicated but trust me it uses only and only two ingredients what I have done is I have put a vessel to heat with roughly around one one-and-a-half inch of water and on top of that I'm going to keep a glass bowl which has chopped white chocolate now technically this entire thing is called chocolate melting by double boiling method so let's get cracking all you need to do is you need to keep stirring it intermittently and ensure at all given points in time that the water does not touch the base and that's the only reason why we fill it around one to one and a half inches only you need to keep stirring this intermittently because you want the heat to kind of uniformly distribute in the chocolate so that the heating and the melting is absolutely uniform also a care needs to be taken is that the bowl from the inside needs to be completely clean there shouldn't be any grease there shouldn't be any water and the same also applies to the stirring ladle or spoon it's been three minutes and the chocolate has beautifully melted on medium to low flame the next is of course the flame and the chocolate next comes down right here and we need to wipe the bottom of the bowl because we do not want any water on the working table all you need to do is stir it so that the chocolate is just kind of at a workable temperature once that's done let's move on to the next step or the next component and that is the cookie part of the cookies and cream for this I'm using Oreo all you need to do is open the sandwich and remove the cream off like so chop the chocolate cookies into finer bits like so the cookies are chopped and ready let's transfer this in a mold well I have these chocolate bar molds if you do not have this I have another wonderful trick coming your way for now all you need to do is add in some bits of these cookies just throw them randomly because that's all you need to do at this stage the next step is to transfer the melted white chocolate into a piping bag you bring the piping back together and just snip off an end and move ahead with piping this like so once you're done with all of this you need to lightly give this a tap not again because you want the audio or the cookies to kind of show like a crust on top let's move on to the quick method that's in case you do not have a mold all you need to do is line a butter paper or a baking sheet or a Silpat whatever you have and you drop all of this onto that sheet well technically this method is called a Belgian crock and of course you can make this with dark milk white any chocolate you spread this as thin as you wish or please finally you top this up with the chopped Oreo like so the next step is to allow all of this to kind of set for 20 minutes at room temperature and after that we'll just keep it in the fridge for some three minutes and you have the most amazing cookies and cream white chocolate bar once the chocolate is set you would realize that it kind of releases from the sides that is when and that's only when you kind of flip it over give it a tap lightly of course because we are not here to break the bars and here you have the most amazing chocolate bar which is done and ready and this is what I call cookies and cream let's move on to checking the chocolate bark as well and that's as simple as spilling this paper very gently like so and you can break this of course in any shape in any size as your desire with this you have cookies and cream which is done and ready at this stage you can use multiple papers pack this do as eco-friendly as you may wish to and this can go straight to your friends the only care that you need to take in this place is this needs to be stored in a cold place not a warm place because it's chocolate and chances are that it may melt again with this your white chocolate bar cookies and cream is done and ready involve your children involve the entire family and make this for your family and friends on that note do not forget to Like share and subscribe to rush report from me and my

water to boil who are we kidding i don't think i'm fooling anyone hey everyone i'm claire welcome to my home kitchen today i have a very special recipe in honor of valentine's day but frankly it's perfect any day of the week any month of the year it's my forever brownies it is a perfect chewy chocolatey but not too chocolatey brownie and special bonus it has melted milk powder in it my forever brownies so named because it's the only recipe i'll ever need [Music] as a brownie lover i particularly prefer a chewy brownie not a cakey brownie i feel like a cakey brownie is just chocolate cake i wanted it to be a dense chewy brownie but one that was fully baked and didn't just rely on under baking to give me that kind of like fudgy texture why did you name it forever right so i called these my malted forever brownies because for me this is now my go-to recipe i won't need another one i'll always go back to this one it's my forever brownie we're in a long term it's a long-term thing me and this recipe [Music] special equipment zero none you just need basic stuff you already have in your kitchen so i have a saucepan over here bowl whisk and an 8x8 pan this recipe has like more ingredients than the average brownie but it's again all super basic stuff so i have semi-sweet chocolate all-purpose flour vanilla extract the malted milk powder which is optional but recommended large eggs brown sugar granulated sugar unsalted butter vegetable oil milk chocolate and cocoa powder and also i'm missing salt that's all what is melted milk powder i've really been trying to i know what like malted stuff is but i have no wheat flour and malted barley extracts so to malt something malting is a process that's used in a lot of like making of spirits and beer where you basically sprout the grain i don't really know what it is the point is it makes things taste delicious it pairs really well with chocolate it's really good i recommend it [Music] oh we have to talk about the 8x8 pan so i have a problem that is ongoing whereby i keep losing my 8x8 metal pan so this is the only 8x8 pan i could find last night realizing i didn't have my metal pan no idea where it is second time i've lost it so now i'm using glass i recommend you use metal i'm going to baking glass and it's going to be fine the first thing i want to do is prepare my pan i have the oven already preheated to 350 which is going to be our baking temp so here is just a sheet of aluminum foil the reason i like foil for brownies is because you can really press the foil into all of the corners of the pan and get it really flat and then it makes it easy to lift out and now you can use melted butter this is just very room temp butter and it's a little warm in here i just want to coat the foil so the first little pre step to this recipe is to do something called bloom the cocoa so basically i'm going to combine the cocoa and hot water and this just brings out the flavor of the cocoa oh the vet texted a photo of felix what's he it he looks so sad and uncomfortable doesn't he look sad poor kitty all right so now i have a electric kettle right here and i'm just bringing this to a boil i'm just gonna sit here and wait for this to boil i got a lot of sticky buns over here there's actually there have been [Music] maybe fewer than a half dozen little typos that i found in the book and there's a typo in this recipe and it is involving this step the recipe says a quarter cup of boiling water but then it says i think four ounces which is a half cup the correct measurement is a quarter cup or two ounces but readers have written in to say that they made it with a half cup and it still turns out great so if you made that mistake don't worry so to this i'm adding six ounces of semi-sweet chocolate then a quarter cup of oil oil contributes to a chewier texture in the final brownie six tablespoons of unsalted butter this whole thing needs to get melted together chocolate is a very very sensitive ingredient particularly temperature sensitive so that's just to say whenever we melt it we want to do that very gently and that's why i use a setup called a double boiler double boiler is kind of an old-fashioned term there's literally like a set of cookware called a double boiler that is a pot with another pot that's set into it and it fits together but most people don't have that so we're just using that same idea i have a saucepan that's coming to a simmer over a fairly gentle heat you don't want to rapidly boil it it's filled with like an inch of water and the idea is that i'm setting a bowl over it a heat proof bowl that's very important and the water underneath is going to simmer it's going to create steam and the steam will gently warm what's in the bowl and i don't need to stir this on the heat until the chocolate is completely melted i can actually take it off the heat and let the heat that's already in the bowl finish melting the chocolate i just want to go most of the way this is totally melted the great thing about brownies is like we're already almost done it's very quick once you have all the ingredients measured out so it's a very um like instant gratification recipe except for the part where i say to chill it for at least an hour at the end but we'll talk about that okay the next step is to add the sugars to your chocolate mixture i'm using a half cup each of light brown sugar and granulated sugar and i'm doing that because the little addition of brown sugar also creates a bit of chewiness and i like the sort of um molasses-y flavor it's subtle but i think it goes well with the chocolate this mixture as i whisk it it looks it's going to look grainy that's normal don't worry just power through keep whisking once you have your sugar very well incorporated i'm going to add my eggs at this stage i found that when you whisk the eggs in really well they it tends to produce that sort of shiny crackly top that to me is what i want the neighbor i think the neighbors are vacuuming it's a loud vacuum was i supposed to add the vanilla yeah i'm supposed to add the vanilla should i wait [Music] okay excellent all right the upstairs vacuuming is stopped um i forgot to add the vanilla i'm gonna do that along with the eggs so one and a half teaspoons it's important for a few reasons that you whisk the eggs in thoroughly you not only want them to bring the batter together and you should have something that looks super super smooth so go ahead and give it elbow grease that's that and now we're going to add the dry ingredients i have three quarters of a cup of all-purpose flour a teaspoon of salt kosher salt if you're using morton use half the amount okay now i'm adding the kind of secret ingredient which is melted milk powder two tablespoons i'm whisking slowly to incorporate and once i have all that flour worked in now i want to go ahead and whisk this i think i say in the book a full 45 seconds so once i've added the flour here is the chance to develop a little bit of a chewy texture by working that flower and trying to develop a little bit of gluten you can see it makes this beautiful ribbon i feel like i'm in one of those lint commercials last step i'm going to fold in milk chocolate there's been such a trend toward ultra bitter dark chocolate and i went along with it for a while only to kind of realize like i don't love something that bitter and i'm kind of into milk chocolate i love how creamy it is how easily it melts this is why you don't want to make that chocolate mixture too hot at the beginning you don't want to fold the milk chocolate into a hot batter because it'll melt i feel like this pan says it's an eight by eight but it's really not the bottom of this pan is six inches across do you see that in what world is this an 8x8 pan i would like someone to explain to me so in this pan whereas typically i use a metal one the batter is going to sit a little taller it's going to be a thicker layer it's going to take probably longer than it typically would to bake so typically with glass i bake 25 degrees lower than the recipe states because i always test the recipe in metal unless i say this is designed for a glass pan but in the case of these brownies because the batter is in a thicker layer i think i am going to actually leave it on 350. and it's just the nature of brownies that these are not going to over bake the way that like a cake would so you're still fine at 350 in glass i feel like a little crazy right now i think i need to drink some water [Music] i feel like i sound crazy i'm talking really fast [Music] the brownies are done they went a little longer than expected but i'll show you how you know when they're done i see cracks along the surface they have pulled away from the sides and when i press in the center what do i say in the book it's like soft but firm or something like that hold on oh okay so the center is dry to the touch but still soft when pressed which i think i nailed it so dry to the touch but still you can see i got some squishiness in there these are going to cool at room temp and when i feel like the bottom of the pan is no longer hot i can either stick the whole thing in the fridge or unmold them cover them and chill at least an hour so i'm going to let these sit here and then pop them in the fridge all right so i'm looking on maybe one of my favorite pages in the whole book which is a recipe matrix which is an idea that i had that i included in the book which basically locates every single recipe on on like a grid with time on the x-axis and difficulty on the y so the really easy quick recipes are the bottom left and i'm looking for brownies and i seriously don't even see them so there's miso buttermilk buttermilk biscuits which are very quick and easy poppy's eating almond cake quick and easy the banana bread quick and easy oh they're right here i see them i see them all right there they are malted forever brownies now this is brings up a good point so i had to look sort of toward the center of the matrix to find them and that's because even though the batter takes minutes and they only take 30 minutes to bake you definitely don't want to cut warm brownies because they won't cut cleanly and they'll you know crumble and everything the other thing is when you chill brownies it gives the butter a chance to set it gives the sugar a chance to kind of like crystallize and you end up with a super super chewy texture and basically the brownies kind of cure so i think that this recipe is not complete until the brownies have had a chance to chill and i have a batch that i made last night and i'm gonna pull out because those have been chilling and they are ready to be eaten oh yay [Applause] where do i put this uh oh the brownies so let's see these are nice and cold this recipe makes 16 nice-sized brownies so you can see the pockets of milk chocolate which have hardened because they've been in the fridge kind of taste i like an edge piece but not a corner piece i've not had these brownies in a long time they really hold up they are the right amount of intensity not too sweet the chocolate really shines and most importantly it has a wonderfully chewy texture obviously this is a rich chocolate recipe perfect for valentine's day i hope you try it but then again there's like no wrong time to make or eat brownies at all so thank you for watching another episode of dessert person i love showing you recipes from the book and stay tuned and like and subscribe oh ferocious cake let go let go oh [Music]", "D0-N_0s_eF0": "\u266a", "Ysw1vbU2VC0": "[Music] hey there my friends welcome back to my kitchen and welcome to the recipe therapist so for Valentine's Day this year I always make something red velvet so this year I decided to elevate my red velvet choice like giving you all a red velvet brownie recipe these brownies stay moist for about a week topped with white chocolate they're so easy I think you're gonna love them so let's get started so let's go over the ingredients of these moist red velvet brownies so today I'm gonna be using 8x8 a square baking dish which I've lined with some wax paper and I sprayed just to make sure it doesn't stick I have my melted salted butter here some all-purpose flour a couple of beaten eggs some white distilled vinegar buttermilk vanilla extract brown sugar some salt some granulated sugar and of course some cocoa powder and last but not least we can't leave out our red food coloring which is about 2 tablespoons you're gonna need which equals out to 1 ounce container and for the top of our brownies instead of cream cheese frosting we're gonna be tracing some white chocolate on top ok so let's get going with our batter so we're gonna start to mix in stages so we're gonna start out with our sugar or regular granulated sugar and I'm going to throw in the brown sugar and on top of that I'm just gonna get all my melted butter and pour that in on top and then I'm going to take my handy mixer and I'm just gonna cream this together for about a minute or so so this is what the sugar and the butter makes you looks like so now what we're going to do is add our egg to this okay all that eggs going right in there and I'm gonna pick this for about another 30 seconds okay so you can see that it's kind of like fluffed up and at this point we're going to add our buttermilk all that buttermilk can have red velvet anything without buttermilk that's how you know it's a good recipe and our vinegar our white distilled vinegar now I'm gonna mix this just to combine and you're gonna see it's gonna have a curdled kind of look but don't get nervous because it's supposed to look like that so I'm just gonna go ahead and mix this okay so you can see that the batter looks very curdled a which is totally fine it's just the combination of the buttermilk and vinegar together it kind of separates it like that but that's totally fine so now we're ready to add our red food coloring and then we're gonna add this whole container just gonna pour it right in okay and I'm not going to mix it with my blender I'm going to fold it in it first with my rubber spatula just get in there good and that's what's gonna make our brownies really nice and red velvety you could have any food coloring if you like really but I'm purposing to make a red velvet brownie today okay so you can see that the food coloring is in there it still looks curdled which is fine but don't worry about that because it's gonna come together really nice as we mix the rest of our remaining ingredients in which we're going to add our salt at this point our vanilla extract and our cocoa powder okay going right in now what I'm gonna do is I was just gonna fold the powder in just like this and then I'm gonna sit so it doesn't poof all up on me when I begin to use my mixer to mix this all together so I'm just gonna fold it in like this and then I'm going to mix it with a mixer for about a minute or sell to blend okay so this is what the batter looks like after we've added our cocoa powder our salt and our vanilla extract so now we're ready for our last ingredient which is our flour so I'm just gonna pour it all in and again I'm gonna do the same thing like I did before I'm gonna use my rubber spatula to fold it in at first because I don't want it to poof all up and then I'm gonna finish it off with my mixer and blend it till it's nice and combined and you're gonna see all that curdling is going to disappear this is our batter look at it it's silky and smooth it's not curly it's just perfect so now we're ready to take this and we're gonna pour it into our 8x8 baking dish okay and it's gonna cook in the oven at 325 degrees for about 30 to 35 minutes okay I'm just gonna spread it around this pan nice and evenly okay just like that wow this really looks good it's really the perfect color and we try to get it even and spread it around okay because I'm gonna cut these up into small squares okay we're gonna have small like brownie bites and it's gonna go in the oven like I said 325 degrees for about 30 to 35 okay so it's been cooking for about 30 minutes and it looks like it could be done I'm just gonna put a toothpick in to test to see if it comes out clean see how it's a little um you know kind of loose on the bottom here and there's some cake batter so I think it's going to have to cook for about another five more minutes and then I think it's hey friends welcome back so I took the red velvet brownies out of the oven and I put them in the refrigerator for about 15 to 20 minutes to cool off tuck them out and I cut them up and this is what they look like they're just perfect they're nice and brown they're moist so now I want to show you how we're going to do the top of them so I taken my white chocolate and I melted it and I put it in my little um you know sandwich bag here so I'm just gonna snip off the end here just and I'm gonna drizzle some chocolate right on top like that and it's going to dry on top of them it's gonna get hard that's why I want to do chocolate instead of um like a cream cheese frosting cream cheese just doesn't harden up but this is gonna harden up real nice and it's gonna taste delicious over these okay and it also adds just a beautiful you know decoration so I'm just gonna finish my last one over here like that that looks great and for some of you that like knots I like knots I have some chopped walnuts here so I'm just gonna drizzle a few chopped walnuts on top okay for that little bit of crunch and some extra flavor and these are just perfect look at them they're beautiful for Valentine's Day I hope you really like them because I know I do so for the

unbelievable I highly recommend this this is so so yummy so let's go get a large mixing bowl and throw in about 550 grams of white chocolate then add a can of sweetened condensed milk that would be about 395 mils pop this in the microwave on HIGH for about 30 to 40 seconds give it a stir and repeat that on 30 second bursts keep stirring until it's melted and combined really well now while that's in the microwave get a packet of Oreos put them in a sealable plastic bag and just beat them into submission now when this is done get the Oreos you can break them up into tiny pieces or chunks I like to have good sized chunks like this in them and then mix this together get a bagging tin or something that you're going to put the mixture in grease it or use some baking or parchment paper and put the mixture on it now just flatten it out as best you can because it's going to be quite thick so you're going to have to move it around and spread it out now if you want the fudge to have a yellow color just with little bits of Oreos in it just crush up maybe three or four re O's but I like to use the whole packet now just chuck this in the fridge for a couple of hours or so to set or you can just put it in overnight if you want alright once that's set as you can see take it out of whatever you put it in and cut it into the desired pieces all you have to do is put this in an airtight container and in the last couple of weeks or so well I hope you like this I've only made this two times before this and it is so yummy it's not funny No Oh words cannot describe I'll see you next time

Yes! Who doesn't love a beautiful, delicious\nchocolate brownie. I wanna show you a perfect one. No flavouring, no nuts, no\nfruit just chocolate, chocolate, chocolate. It's gonna be crisp and it's gonna puff\nup and then it's gonna crack. It's gonna be gooey in the middle, it's gonna blow your\nmind. First up chocolate. Come have a little\nlook at this. This is beautiful 70 percent cocoa solid chocolate. 70 percent\nmeans the amount of cocoa solids in the chocolate. It will taste a little bit\nbitter when you eat it like this right but when you mix it with butter and\nsugar and all the other ingredients it's gonna be amazing.\nSo 250 grams of chocolate goes in a bowl. I've got a pan simmering very gently. Put\nthat over the top. Then I've got 250 grams of butter. Try and get the best one\nyou can because the best butter, the best chocolate, makes the best brownie. So if\nyou're gonna make brownie it's a wonderful treat, but if you're gonna do\nit do it properly. Do it really, really well. Dice up the butter and get it into\nthe bowl and just very gently we wanna melt that down gently, gently. Next up the\nsugar and the eggs. Four eggs into a bowl. Lovely free-range, organic eggs is gonna\ngive you a better product. 250 grams of golden caster sugar and whisk up the\neggs and the sugar until the sugar's fully dissolved. As you beat it, it goes\npale, fluffy and light and that will be your texture and it will also give you\nthe crispiest little topping for your brownie. And if you want the recipe for\nthis just click the link go over to jamieoliver.com I've got this recipe and\nthousands of others. Go and fill your boots! Then it comes to the flour part.\nTwo heaped tablespoons of self-raising flour by using the little sieve you're\nallowing the flour to be as light and as delicate as it can be. Two heaped tablespoons of\nquality cocoa powder. Use the whisk now fold it don't beat it. If I just sit\nthere and beat it then we lose all the air that we put in to the eggs. The\nchocolate is almost done and a lovely little tip right just get a pinch of\nsalt and season your chocolate. It sounds weird but it makes all the difference.\nIt opens up your taste buds, it allows you to taste the\nfull flavour of the chocolate and it genuinely really does make a difference.\nI got given that tip like 25 years ago from this incredible French chocolatier\nand I've always done it since and it works. And then we're gonna go in with\nevery last bit of it. Look at that, look at the colour, look at the shine. Back to\nthe folding. Have a look at that, we've still got air in there and of\ncourse at this point you can lick the whisk, it's filthy but who wouldn't! I've\ngot myself a lovely cake mould and then we're gonna go in with that amazing\nbrownie every last bit of it. Move it around get it into the corners look at\nthat. Chocolate heaven. And I've put it into one of my tins here. If you wanna\ncheck out my lovely range of bakeware check it out there's a whole bunch of\ndifferent shapes and sizes, beautiful colour. Now I'm gonna put this in an oven\non fan at 180 degrees Celsius which is 350 Fahrenheit and close the door gently and\nthat's gonna be amazing. It will take about half an hour to cook but I will\nshow you exactly what I'm looking for for the perfect brownie because it looks\nlike you've got to slightly under cook it but you've gotta have the faith. Trust\nme. Look at that! That's just under 30 minutes and you can see it's poofed up right it's gone really crisp on the outside and if you just shake it, can you\nsee that wobble? Right so I do want it cooked on the outside but it's slightly\nunder in the middle and I just wanna let that cool down for about 15 minutes\nbefore you even think about eating it. Hold yourself back! Don't go in! Let it\ncool down and then you're gonna get more flavour and you're gonna get more texture.\nIt's gonna be amazing. Let's get into there, let's have a look at the texture. I\nlove the way that when you cut through it, look that's what you want.\nOozieness. You can see that the top is almost sharding it's cracking. Guys, guys,\nguys. Come and see that. Yes! So this is what I want for you. Right, it's really\ncrisp and delicate and thin on the top. It's kind of spongy around the outside\nhere and then in the middle it's oozie and gorgeous and unctious and chocolatey and the chocolate will taste different because of that cooking, right? So that is\ngood. We like that. A nice little scoop of vanilla ice cream. Some hazelnuts,\nchocolate, hazelnut, vanilla ice cream. Come on you know it makes sense! And then\nwhat we love to do in the restaurants is popcorn. Of course that little bit of heat from\nthe brownie, it's gonna start to melt the ice cream really, really nice. Right,\nenough talking let's get a nice small spoon and let's have a little try up. Mmm! That is a very agreeable brownie it's really good. Guys go on, that's what you\ngotta do this weekend or today and enjoy. Take care.", "edxpY6HnJxY": "hi this is Adriana from tasty pastry kitchen and today we're gonna go over four easy and fun cake circle fillings I'll show you how to make my favorite cake pop mix but if you don't have cake on hand or maybe you just don't like this sort of filling I'll also give you three alternatives and these three extra kacica fillings actually don't have any cake in them in fact they use very simple ingredients and they're probably already sitting in your pantry okay so here are the four fillings that we're gonna cover in this tutorial on your far right is my cake pop mix and my favorite way to do this is to use white chocolate and fresh crumbled cake and the second filling is my chocolate cake circle mixture which is just graham crackers cocoa powder and a little bit of milk and then my third filling is a peanut butter filling which is similar to what you would find inside a peanut butter cup this one has to be my absolute favorite and then the last filling is a cookies and cream filling so I'm just using Oreos here but you can use vanilla Oreos or whatever flavor you like okay let me show you how I make my first filling which is the cake pop mix the first thing that you need to do is make a really loose ganache and I typically do this by weight and what I do is put into a microwave-safe Bowl a two-to-one ratio of white chocolate to heavy cream then I melt this mixture on 50% power at 10-second intervals until it's all completely melted and mixed and the chocolate kind of turns yellow then set that aside for a second while you prepare the cake crumbs and here I just have some left over cutouts from my golden butter cake and most the time I just grab this from the freezer because I save these when I make my large cakes and what you want to do is just take your hands and break them up into crumbs and then once all of the cake has been broken up pour in all of your melted white chocolate and then take your hand and kind of toss around the crumbs with the white chocolate ganache you'll know that it's ready when you can form the cake pop mix into a ball now if you're using the dipping method to make your cake circles you want to make sure that this cake pop is very moist it has to be able to stay in the shape of a cake cycle when you put them in the fridge and then dip them if you're using the shelling method you can go a little bit lighter with the white chocolate ganache and I'll put a link to that video in the top corner of this one so you can check out both of those methods and figure out which one is best for you okay on to the second filling which is the chocolate gram filling this one strangely enough doesn't taste of strong graham cracker flavor but actually tastes like a deep dark chocolate cake and what you're going to need are some graham cracker crumbs which you can use a food processor to make or you can use a zip top bag with a rolling pin all you're gonna do is discuss it into crumbs and then take all of those and pour it into a large mixing bowl then add a little bit of cocoa powder and then some granulated sugar a pinch of salt and then you're gonna whisk that until it's completely combined then switch over to your spatula and drizzle in some milk and then mix it until it forms a ball it's gonna be a little bit sticky but that's fine you should be able to grab a bit of it and form it into a ball pretty easily and you can give it a taste and see if you want a little bit more of salt or a little bit more sugar and that's it that's your chocolate graham cracker filling okay on to filling number three which is the peanut butter filling and all you're getting me for this is some peanut butter you can use creamy or crunchy some melted butter and then use a mixer to mix the butter and peanut butter until it's all combined and then you're gonna add a bit of powdered sugar to your peanut butter mixture and this is going to serve two purposes the first being of course adding sweetness to the filling and the second one is that it adds a bit of structure to the filling so that it's not so gooey from the peanut butter and then add a splash of vanilla and then a pinch of salt and then add about a teaspoon of water and this is gonna loosen the mixture up a little bit so that it molds easily into the cake sickles give it a good mix again until it's all combined and if you feel like it's a little bit too dry you can add a couple drops of water or on the other hand if you feel like it's too wet go ahead and add a couple teaspoons of powdered sugar and again once you can easily form the mixture into a ball it should be good to fill inside the cake Segel so the last filling is cookies and cream and like I said I'm using chocolate Oreos here but don't feel like you have to do that too you can take this in a lot of different directions you can use mint Oreos you can use golden Oreos you could even use something like bisque off cookies if you wanted something more spicy it's really up to you okay to start you're gonna want some cookie crumbs and I'm just using a food processor but you could use a zip top bag and a rolling pin to get some fine crumbs and then take those cookie crumbs and dump them into a large mixing bowl add a little bit of softened cream cheese to the cookie crumbs and use a spatula to mix then go in with your hand and make sure that you can shape it into a ball really easily this case achill mixture is deceivingly simple but it's so good that I use it really often there you have it for fun and really easy fillings for your cake sicles all the ingredient amounts will be on my blog tasty pastry kitchen check out my other videos where I get into the nerdy details of baking and cake circles thanks and have a great day", "T_Hh5WE7eMU": "[Music]

time for seeya", "9SOUPfeyQT0": "what's up everyone back for another beer review and today I'll be reviewing yet another beer from the burly oak Brewing Company and they are out of Berlin Maryland and this is their fuzzy wuzzy slippers the cookies and cream cheese cake vary so this is an Imperial Stout that is brewed with brownie mix and then conditioned on 200 pounds of Oreo cookies and cheesecake comes in at 10.5% alcohol by volume no IBUs listen time of review this can is just over a one-month old no one to give a huge thanks and shout out once again to a very good friend of mine and a viewer of the channel Alex for hooking me up with this one thank you very much good sir i truly appreciate it i'll post a link in the description box to the bier mailbox can video idea that contains all the goodies Alex sent my wanting you sent me a lot of them and you know full disclosure here this beer is open you might actually be able to see the remnants of the beer around the rim so I saw a lot of reports of this one exploding I notice cream cheese cheesecake stuff like that these beers might explode when kept cold the entire time but I wanted to open this one up over a sink to make sure it didn't explode everywhere we're not reviewing it and it really didn't explode it just gushed a little bit but I did it did not breach the top just kind of like rushed out of the can and then kind of went back in so the top of the can is stained but I did not lose any beer at all a little bit around the rim but it did not pour over everything but one open up over a sink and I want to be honest with you guys and say yes I've opened this off camera but I've not tasted it I have not poured it and I don't think I lost any of it which is the best thing so this sounds crazy you're talking about brewing with brownie mix conditioning at Oreo cookies and cheesecake big Imperial Stout this might be delicious it might be a mess who knows on the side here I love how they can't say actual Oreo cookies just says Imperial Stout with a chocolate sandwich cookies okay I get it you know copyright in the whole nine trademark all that stuff alright let's give this a poor Wow that's motor oil that is definite motor oil definitely carbonated quite quite a bit too so didn't really lose any of it little bit of a cheat there but I can't really taste you much just a little bit so ya know had a little bit of dirty glass my vehicle come on I'm not gonna you know I'm just gonna leave it badge of honor right there dirty glass mafia doesn't usually happen to me but anyway uh you could see it right here this is pitch black in the glass more like a very dark brown color it looks very murky and this weird kind of reminds me of that uh thing was the Dewey beer that he sent me that was kind of similar to this um it did not look good in a glass but it tasted pretty good that's time what this looks like you see remnants probably of the Cheesecake and the cookies and everything on the side but that looks pretty nice so let's get a knows who definitely has a big like Imperial style kind of vibe to it yeah lots of complex chocolate no sweeter dark chocolate 5060 percent cacao bars baker's chocolate the whole nine not super sweet chocolate this one which is crazy because brownie mix you know Oreo cookies and cheesecake when I'm starting to get the brownie batter as this opens up a glass now this is been on my fridge and probably part of the reason why I was afraid to open it on camera and whatnot and didn't want explode is that I want to warm up a little bit I don't like drinking mmm any of my beer like ice cold I usually drink most of them at least out of the fridge for 20 or 30 minutes and a beer like this it's been out of fridge for about an hour and that's kind of what I prefer whoo starting to get to get a little bit like the shop it from an Oreo now the brownie batter is definitely there it's sweet but it's like a reserved sweetness this is not smell sickly sweet and that's what I thought there's even like like base roasted kind of mullet ease to this one from the base Imperial style a little bit of vanilla sure cheesecake you know the I guess from the Oreo cookies sans lactose the the filling but like a vanilla kind of sweetness yeah so definitely getting the brownie batter brownie mix the sweetness from like the Oreo cookies not really saying cheesecake outside like a vanilla but uh it smells pretty good it doesn't smell amazing or like blowing my mind or whatever just smells like a really nice like chocolate heavy like if I was doing this blind I say like chocolate vanilla Imperial stuff that's what I say but it smells pretty good so let's get into it cheers everybody and thanks again out it's very hmm very chocolate heavy I dig it it's definitely sweet it's not cloying but it's sweet so body on this one it no 10 a half percent it's pretty thick I'd say like lower side a full body definitely has a nice viscosity viscosity to it nice thickness to it definitely not quite chewy but approaching that body's nice the mouthfeel even though you saw like the carbonation physically and everything on the palate definitely lots of carbonation could be I mean only open it like 5 less than five minutes before I reviewed and so I shouldn't be an issue but it's not as carbonated it's it's it's not flat butts definitely under carb so it has a nice soft smoothness to it I would thought it would be a little bit more creamy cheesecake Oreos you know brownie batter I thought it'd be more like a creamy like kind of sensation really not the taste oh this is really chocolate having the chocolate character this one is super complex sweet dark shock like I said baker's chocolate 5060 percent cacao bar you know chocolate the chocolate from the Oreos there is just a good overall choc equality this one now if I was doing this is a whodunit beer you know done a beer review or mystery beer if you would I be able to tell you there's Orioles in here or cheesecake or brownie batter probably not just be honest with you I just don't think I would be able to I'd say this is a really I'd say this was brewed with cacao or some kind of chocolate and this probably even say vanilla I am getting vanilla like halfway through the palette but upfront all that chocolates just kind of attacking my palate and that carries on through through the rest of the palate like this is a big like almost fudgy brownie esque kind of just sweetness and it's in its chocolate personified it's it's it's really nice I do enjoy this one and it's not too sweet which I thought it would be I mean is definitely sweet don't get me wrong you're expecting the 10 5 % Imperial Stout with those three ingredients to be sweet but it's not overly sweet if finishes with a residual sweetness that's you know pretty big but it doesn't get to the point that it's cloying for me um I get a little bit of alcohol alcohol screw see on the back the palate kind of you know stop it maybe from approaching cloying because it gets close but it doesn't hit it all right outside that slightly alcohol sure see I'm really not getting any chest for murder in the stomach which is crazy so high is the alcohol relatively well I'd probably guess like eight and half nine percent so not quite 10 a half percent so I think they did a good job with the body the mouthfeel little underwhelming the hiding of the alcohol is really nice and I like the child characters so I really like this beer the only issue I have with it for me personally is that I'm really not getting specifically each of the ingredients or like even then blended I'd say the one that I'm getting the most probably the bounty the brownie mix because I'm getting like a brownie batter almost fudge as kind of you know character to the beer but I wouldn't necessarily say brownie mix not really tasting the Oreo cookies exactly and the Cheesecake I've had she's taken out in like four or five beers and it just doesn't like the cheese kay you would think okay that she's guessing you're gonna get graham cracker and you know the cheesecake base which is a vanilla and just like a sweetness and creaminess and I just usually don't get it so it's tough to I guess taste the cheesecake in a beer but yeah uh it's a nice beer I really do enjoy it so I'm gonna be honest with you like I always am out to get fudgy it was he slippers the chocolate sandwich cookie cheesecake Imperial Stout which again this is the cookies and cream cheese cake barium I'm gonna give it a little four out of five and go 3.95 I I just for me to get it you know right to a four or even higher I want to taste the Oreos I kind of want to taste the cheesecake and I want this mouthfeel to not be as other carpetas I just want more fun I you get there's so many beers you get like this that are like oh man the you know that it sounds amazing or it looks amazing or you know you think it's going to be amazing than you drink they're like man no this is a good beer but not what I kind of thought it was gonna be and that's kind of this beer it's not a bad beer in the least I'm actually enjoying it a three point nine five two solid damn score but at the end of the day I was thinking this would be a great beer and it'll be amazing and it would be fantastic and it's just not it happens but here thing I still appreciate Alexson at my way because I would not get a chance to try it this beer if it wasn't for the generosity and kindness of a guy like Alex did you send these beers my way and I just I'm so thankful that alex is Alex's Gera dude he just sends me awesome beer and I get a chance to try it and I always tell anybody whoever sends me beers whether it's a brewery or you know people that you'll watch the reviews or even France always honest with the beer review because why you sit up here and just be like everything's fantastic well thank you for a sec like I appreciate everybody sending me beer I do and you [ __ ] so cool but you got to keep it honest you got to keep it 100 safe maybe not and three point nine to five is the best I can do for this beer it's still good it's just not mind blowing and that's where it lands so yeah anyway not much more to say about it price and availability brewery only I'm pretty sure and place pouring this one I believe was twenty two hours four pack what I pay $22 for pack for this beer again I would not I did not Alex did or Alex you know got his hands on some cans whether trading or whatever or he probably went to the brewery I'd imagine and I would not pay that again personally for this beer but if they would have if they would release this one locally and I never had it before I would went bought a four pack no doubt without question so again huge thanks Alex for hooking me up with this beer and all the beers a lot of fun to try a little bit disappointed by this one not a bad bearing the lease just all the crazy [ __ ] they're talking about on the label and what they're brewing it with and stuff just doesn't resonate with me personally but it's still a pretty good beer I'm gonna drink the rest of it and enjoy it but she was hoping was a little better so if you've had this one before or any of the fudgie it was he slippers beers with in their series let me know and I'd love to hear somebody else's opinion on this one we've had it because again I'm just one person it's my palate my palate really doesn't matter to your palate probably I mean even if you like the same beers I do 99% of the time that means 1 out of 100 beers you will not like as much as me and more often than that even some you know some friends like a good buddy of mine and viewer the channel Jeff aka no jinx him and I probably agree on 80 90 percent of the beers but that means one or two beers out of 10 will have a differing of opinion whether it's rating or what we thought of beer and that's that's what beers all about but that's what life's about you know we don't all have the same taste so because giving this a 3.9 that doesn't mean if you see this one you shouldn't try it out for yourself still go try it you might love this one you might hate it who knows but that's why I like reviewing beers and that's why I have a youtube channel that's why I'm a beer tuber because I like telling you guys my opinion but my opinion is only my opinion you gotta try it for yourself to see if you actually like it so I'm gonna stop ranting and raving about absolutely nothing I'm gonna head out thanks again to Alex for this beer for all the beer so thanks to everybody for the continued support and checking out another review to the next one Cheers", "9_-TLNOTfDw": "and you know what that means it is Thursday and that means number one hopefully if you are a hell we know tonight's fan you enjoyed the six-hour pop cast we discussed Halloween Horror Nights 25 our thoughts on the first three weeks and four weeks of the event and that was from the mouths of people that attended at least two nights if not a lot more including my friends Tyler and Andy from homemade hot Jeremy from Jeremy films as well as Ian for like 30 seconds he was there and it was like more than 30 minutes but it seems like he was there like oh god I gotta go but it happened sometimes no worries and we also had Cameron joined us cryptic cam and we even had a special surprise when Vic joined us dr. Emmett Brown won so it was a really fun conversation really enjoyed it and I'm glad everybody took part as well as mr. entertainment so yeah thank you everyone for joining us last night and hopefully you enjoyed the podcast we have a lot more to come because as I made an announcement last night those are your regular sir on pop as of right now when it comes to the panels for the Halloween Horror Nights podcast so that being said I do want to say this Thursday so that means it's time for yet another edition of stiff and snack obviously i'm holding the water glass which means it's time for sip and stack and could you believe that this started back in nineteen twelve my god 103 years ago an incredible creation was made and that was by the Nabisco company and it was called an Oreo and it was an Oreo biscuit and it was created in chelsea manhattan and the what is now the modern-day Chelsea Market complex located on ninth avenue between 15th and 16th streets wikipedia for the win and that way right now is actually called oreo away if you go now and that trademark was made in 1912 as well and it was an imitation of like the hydraulics cookie which like I said was a sandwich cookie that was introduced in 1908 by the sunshine company that being said I've been a big fan of Oreos pretty much my whole life we've done a lot of Oreos on this channel and I would say we've done white fudge Oreos we've done cookie dough Oreos obviously my favorite cuz I love me some cookie dough we've done mint oreos we've got s'mores Oreos that Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Oreos and unfortunately I've not done it on here but I do like the birthday cake Oreos and most especially which is strange because it's not a chocolate variant it is a vanilla sandwich cookie very and that's the fruit punch Oreos i really enjoy those because obviously throughout the years i know a lot of people would take cookies and dunk them in milk i dunk mine in kool-aid and i do that with chocolate oreos so it wasn't chocolate oreos but it still work just fine and I really enjoyed it now when I look at this list I saw a lot of Oreos I really would like to try some of which are no longer available we have a lemon ice Oreo that was from Japan blueberry ice cream Oreos would from Singapore Indonesia and Malaysia in 2010 and is also sold in Thailand and China as well we have something that i know would have been super awesome orange ice cream Oreos I same thing Indonesia Malaysia Singapore and Thailand but that was 2011 there was an Oreo DQ blizzard cream which is a limited edition flavor between April and May of 2010 celebrating the 25th anniversary of dairy queens blizzard we also had ice cream rainbow sherbert which is pretty much kind of like what we did with the ice cream pebbles from the other day and I really like sherbert orange sherbert rainbow sherbert is good stuff it was basically raspberry and lime sherbert flavors in a cookie that sounds amazing the affirmation fruit punch Oreos add two variants one being the red velvet Oreos which I never found I'm pretty sure actually you know honestly I do think I have a red velvet Oreos on this channel somewhere because i don't know i i'm pretty sure i've done red velvet Oreos but i'm not positive because i looked at the list and it's yeah there it is it was one of the hodgepodge videos of in February red velvet or is on the list it's a from februari 26 yeah thank you for a google in my own name it sometimes works and it tells you I we've done red velvet Oreos on this channel and the other one is candy oreos which sounds amazing it was a target exclusive which is why I never got it cuz obviously don't have a target around me I know I'm sorry I just don't have the far less appear and absolutely crappy walmart and i can tell you right now i have no idea what that weird lighting in the back is but it's just kind of there so my apologies for the weird lighting in the video i will state right now that we're caught in candy flavors pink and blue cream filling I don't know exactly what they would have tasted like they're also vanilla sandwich cookie variants so that leads us to today and our sip at sac is uh naw Rios I got two flavors I got one from July and one from August so I'm very topical here the July favor flavor is a cookies and cream and peer dues as flatliners to tell you it's a limited edition flavor you see I'm not open this package yet this was also created with the birthday cake Oreos and the chocolate oreos you see on the back here say birthday cake and chocolate and I'm not open these this sounds great i've always been a big fan of cookies and cream ice cream so I'm sure this is gonna be awesome so we lift the tab here i love the Oreos how they're like tiny packages now I mean it's only um 10.7 ounces and have that much next thing we lift and I will lift that and open it right on camera here I'll to thing i'll show you a cookie and then outputs cookie together so we have you see the frosting here I'll to take it off so you can see better that looks like cookies and cream it maybe Cookie overload but I think it's going to be worth it I'm obviously have your normal Oreo sandwich cooking and your cookies and cream cream inside so crazed and cream cream I know it sounds redundant but it's true yeah definitely smells like cookies and cream ice cream um let's see what we got here I'll put it back because it's sacrilegious not to a eat this together I know some people like spring apart and like make like multi-layered ones but now this really work for me so let's see what we got here got my animated character taste your glass here as we always do unless I'm one location and I will see what we got especially a regular Oreo I mean yeah I can get a little bit um the taste is somewhat there you definitely tell there's cookies and cream on top of a sandwich cookie it's kind of redundant but it doesn't taste bad it's actually really good and the aftertaste is actually what makes it work really well for me to be totally honest I think that it is a very welcome addition to the Oreo family and hopefully it's not a addition that goes away any time soon so let's finish this Oreo shall we hmm very good watch this very well done norio good job and yeah the after taste is actually what gets you when it comes to it I really enjoy this flavor of oreo and it's really good so all right so I'm gonna shoot with you guys um this is open and the reason it's open is because my mom has been snacking on it so I've not touched this yet I'll shoot with you guys when I present my name is Suren desing and ice solemnly swear I did not eat one of these oreos off camera no this is the first time I'm trying this I my moms like these are so good I was like you ate almost a whole bag and she's like shut up and I was like no no you ate almost the whole batch like uh  you were eating no you should understand when I have a sip and snack item I don't try it until I'm right in front of you guys so we'll open this so it's a lot easier now this is brownie batter and I'll show you what it looks like here brownie batter this apparently is also when the birthday cake and mint varieties adamant variety i tried a couple weeks ago your insipid snack and it's like brownie batter in an Oreo so i'll show you what it looks like first we'll take it apart it's like solid black chocolate there smells like brownie batter smells like I just like put cake frosting on in Oreos who would it taste like as we're gonna have screwed that back on here and let's try it shall we who have good hmm I was really good hmm like that cake batter Oreos and brownie batter Oreos like mix them together and like I'm crunch him up and then like put them over ice cream oh boy that'd be amazing um this is really good it does taste like brownie batter it literally is like when you were growing up when your mom where your grandmother would make cookies and make brownies to make fudge obviously one of the things I always did was you had the beaters and you had the spatula and one of the coolest things was lick the spatula lick the beaters and I remember doing that with cookie dough and brownie batter and that's exactly what this tastes like it reminds me of back when I was a kid when I got that little small tiny bowl that grandma had leftover of the leftover brownie batter and I got to eat it and it was glorious and that's exactly what this tastes like in an Oreo cookie so you could not you're wrong with either of these items if you're a chocolate fan this is right up your alley mmm problem so so ends another edition of stuff and snack on next week I have another special has been just Oreos next week specials gonna be on town house you've actually got three different kinds of town house that we're going to be trying we have three different actual taste of town house we're gonna be trying gonna be a little bit of pretzel their little salt their little sleep there and there's gonna be some pita there so yeah you decide what that means if you'd like and I will say right now that I was just informed today that my mom's going on a very long long job so that means that she's going to be gone for a while which means sip and snack on location will be prevalent throughout the remainder of the year yeah that's right i'm actually filming a lot of sip and snacks while i'm in orlando in a couple weeks and you won't get them right away you'll get one on thursday obviously but you won't get the other ones until I get back because a lot of stuff I gotta do and I have a hard time trying to get to take care of sip and snack items as it is and when the transportations not there makes it even harder so don't worry seven snacks on going anywhere we'll have some fun and you have some good ideas that I things i want to do i will spend the money just so i can entertain you guys out there and i will have something from epcot international food and wine festival too there's a couple things I want to try there and I don't forget they will be on sip and snack I don't know exactly when but they'll be on their mark my words so that being said i want to thank you guys and girls out there for

happen because you don't want to see me puke on this channel so I it almost happened once it happened with the if you go back and watch the ill-fated scallop potatoes video oh my god yeah that's the worst that's ever got intercepted snack and it's funny because once my stomach gets settled after that i actually had another sip and snack that i did it was good because it was a lot a lot better was a lot more drinks and it was a lot better on my stomach it coded it better with the the weirdness of the fact that i don't know how to cook obviously i can make pizza in the oven no problem i can deep fry that's cool but when it comes down to it no no Owen can't make stuff from scratch does not work does not compute so you won't get any videos like that so if it's in my power to make it happen I'll

guys have a good night god bless you until the next recipe see you later", "gIdtsQ_QluM": "hey guys welcome back to my channel as you can see i'm not in my normal setting because we've all gone back into lockdown i thought i'd bring back my back to basic recipes for you so here are a few really simple and easy recipes to follow using basic equipment and ingredients and i hope you enjoy them so one of the top back to basic recipes that you guys voted for was brownies now i have an amazing brownie recipe on my youtube channel it does involve a stand mixer and it's a little longer process however this recipe is super simple no stand mixer needed and it is so quick and easy to make we're going to start off with some melted butter in a bowl and i'm going to add some canola oil now you can use any flavorless oil here vegetables sunflower as long as it's flavorless and then i'm going to add my sugars so i've got some white sugar and some dark brown sugar and this is going to add that dark caramely flavor to the brownies and then i'm going to take a whisk and whisk that all together now i'm only using a whisk because i find it easier to mix with i'm not incorporating air or anything it's just to ensure that the sugar breaks up and the butter and oil fully mixes in once it's mixed it will look like a thick paste and now it's time to add the eggs so i've got two eggs i always crack them separately just in case you get a little bit of shell in there and you can add that in and mix that through so i'm just going to be changing the whisk for a spatula but before i start mixing i'm actually going to sieve together the flour and the cocoa powder it can go straight into the bowl but the reason why i like to sift the flour and cocoa powder is because cocoa powder usually has a lot of lumps in and i want the flour and cocoa to mix in together really evenly so by sieving them together this ensures me to do that so as you can see there's quite a few cocoa lumps at the bottom so i'm just going to use my spatula to push that through and then slowly fold in the flour and cocoa into the rest of the mixture now i am doing more folding action here with my spatula now as you can see we've only used cocoa powder here but we use quite a lot and so the chocolate flavor is really dominant in this recipe and you can see once the flour and cocoa powder is mixed in you get this beautiful smooth brownie mix however you can't make brownies without real chocolate so here i've got some chopped up dark chocolate and i'm going to sprinkle it in but leave some in the bowl because i'm going to put that on top once it's in the tin i'm going to fold in this chocolate until all those chocolate pieces are incorporated within the batter and now it's time to fill my baking tin so here i've actually got a glass pyrex dish that i've greased and lined fully you can do it in a normal baking tin and the brownie mix goes straight into the tin just make sure you fully lined whatever you're using to ensure the brownie doesn't stick to the tin it will make your life a lot easier when you're trying to take it out so i'm just going to use the back of my spatula to spread the butter out evenly making sure it's really in those corners too and then with that remaining chocolate i'm now going to sprinkle it over the top this recipe is also really adaptable if you want to add nuts you can certainly do that as well and sprinkle nuts on the top and you can even flavor this with some orange zest because i think orange and chocolate are a match made in heaven once you're happy with the top it's ready for the oven so i've been preheating my oven at 175 degrees celsius and i'm going to bake it for about 20 to 25 minutes what you're looking for when it's baked is for it to be completely set around the outside but still soft in the middle and that is the trick to achieving a gooey brownie it's all about the cooking as tempting as it is to eat it now you're going to have to wait until the brownies completely cool before you cut it open otherwise it's just a big brownie mess so what i've done here i've left my brownie to completely cool and i've actually put it in the fridge for two hours for it to firm up so now i can remove it from the tray and cut it up without a mess you can obviously cut it into any size or shape you want but i'm gonna go for classic squares perfectly bite-sized [Music] and just to show you how gooey these brownies are i've got a couple of pieces here look at that so it's all about the cooking of the brownie you can also see those chunks of chocolate in there as well and they're delicious when you bite into it so there we go my super simple brownie recipe no stand mixer needed i promise you give it a go and you won't regret it don't forget to tag me at george's cakes in your back to basic creations and i can't wait to see them and see you soon for more basic [Music] tutorials", "Sje7KBTYf7w": "[Music] [Applause]

next video call thank you", "LYamj0QjlwQ": "today we're going to be making a cookies and cream hi first thing you want to do is get your chocolate cookie crust ready I did a video on how to make this I'll put a link down in the description box I made this last night you want to let this cool before you use it before you put any filling in it so yeah put some of this off to the side now you want to take your Oreo cookies these are not Oreos these are generics because I'm thrifty and all we're going to do is crush up some of these I'm going to set these off to the side to use as a garnish I'm going to take these I find that one row of a package is just enough there's like 12 or 13 or something in a row I'm going to put these into a plastic bag and you just want to crush them up just like that they don't have to be super fine they don't have to be crushed into a powder just there in small little pieces that will suffice now we're going to set this off inside and work on the filling all right for the filling we're going to take a 1 cup 8 ounces of half-and-half put that into our mixing bowl and we're going to take one package of instant vanilla pudding we're going to dump that in there mix this around you just want to keep whisking it until it kind of thickens up like that now we're going to add our crushed up Oreos taking the whisk out you know I don't know if I mentioned or not you do not want to use the double stuffed Oreos you just want to use the regular ones with the double stuff there's too much cleany stuff in there not enough cookie really what you want or what you're going after is the cookie all right then you're just going to mix this out and now to this you're going to add an 8 ounce carton of cool web just like so and mix this together you don't have to fold this it's not necessary to be gentle with the Cool Whip at all till it's all mixed up like that now you get your pie crust just want to scoop the filling into we crossed all the goodness on the bowl just like that smooth this around kind of mounted up in the middle just like that and then set this in the freezer for about an hour I find that putting it in the freezer actually sets the Pyatt better than if you just put in the fridge so I'm going to put this in the freezer and I'm gonna be back this has been chilling out in the freezer for a little bit now it's time to decorate the top I have a piping bag here with a star tip it's not my preferred tip but it'll get the job done and I just put Cool Whip in this because I didn't want to go through the whole hassle of making whipped cream and this is just for home at the diner I do use real whipped cream but all you want to do is put a nice little edging around it and if you don't have a piping bag you can certainly just put dollars of whipped cream on the individual pieces if you want that's perfectly fine perfectly acceptable now what I did is I get this at a time took some of the Oreos and cut them in half basically you want the number of pieces or number of cookie halves same number as the pie slices you're going to cut this into I'm going to do six so we will do six pieces just like that and there you go your cookies and cream pie is done enjoy", "SwNMaV1ndsQ": "so today we are showing love to the box mix and it's friday i don't know what that means you already know what it means come on back and let's go

we're gonna show you how to use box mixes make them taste like you were baking for hours with the help of food and lifestyle expert Alejandra Ramos from always order dessert we're gonna take a make kind of a hybrid yes rookie yes that way you don't have to choose okay all right I'll be like that brownie and a cookie all in one bite okay so we're starting off with our box mix and we're just gonna add we're gonna make it a little fancier with a little espresso powder salt and then pretty much yeah thank you the rest you just follow the instructions on the package about the oil the egg get that all in there whisk it up with our mix I'll let you do the West King and I'll pour so I'm just using regular brownie mix you can use your favorite I like a dark chocolate okay but uh you wix that up and get into it then you have our beautiful perfect little mix over here so you get this in the pan I'll hold you scoop in there and you notice you've lined it with foil yeah so this is my little trick you get the foil in there so it overhangs on both sides then you can just pull them right up oh you have to flip them out you know just you know dig them out of the pan get that perfect in there you smooth this out yeah season with that out I'm gonna stick this over here little brownies on you and now the fun part sweep that cookie dough we'll just get the kind in the package I'm using chocolate chip but you can use peanut butter you can use sugar cookie dough whatever you like and then you just kind of pop them right on there just crumble the whole thing you may not need the whole thing and what I like to do is I like cookie dough iceberg the call so you push part of it down and then you can put a little bit more on top so it's it's it's multi layers actly yes exactly move inland but so since brownies and cookies bake at different times the trick is you cover it with foil for the first part of the baking okay and then you take it off at the end so you can leave brown up the cookies a little bit that's how you get them in other words you get that gets that crunched kind of exactly so you get these magical crunchy cookies on top and then your delicious fudgy brownie

well pour in all of the batter and level it with a spatula you're going to microwave it for 2 minutes and the timing may vary depending upon your microwave now i'll be inserting a toothpick the

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] fudgie Joey right in the middle it's got the crispy edge that's ooh this is great I'm actually eating this brownie like in the morning so want to make this in the oven you will cook it for eight minutes at 350 degrees fahrenheit oven temperatures will vary so I'm guessing like seven to eight minutes this was six minutes in the air fryer at 275 was the airfryer cooks everything much more quickly and it gets it's much more efficient if that makes sense so 275 is equivalent to like a 350 in the oven that's not perfect science don't quote me on that but that's the gist of it's gonna be you're gonna need to have it hotter than the actual of incredible it's dripping right now mmm it's doughy having like if you guys love the skillet cookie recipe in episode

small or you can get it all for yourself and guys for watching see you in the next video", "jC9g9w1HpgI": "[Music] hi guys welcome back to my channel today I'm going to show you how to make a brownie cookies and cream ice cream cake it has a brownie layer on the top and the bottom and as homemade cookies and cream ice cream in the middles let's get started so first make one recipe of the world's best brownies but don't add in the chocolate chips and pour the batter into two greased stand lines eight inch round cake pans and spread them out in the pan we want a really thin layer you don't have to spread it all the way to the edges it will do that's automatically in the oven and sprinkle the top with semi-sweet chocolate chips and place them into the oven for about 15 minutes they won't take as long as regular brownies because they're thin and try not to over bake them and now to make the ice cream in a large saucepan add the milk heavy cream sugar and salt and place the saucepan over medium-high heat and heat it until it nearly comes to a simmer while it's heating in a small bowl add the flour and the milk and mix them together until it's smooth you'll know the mixture is ready when you just start seeing bubbles forming around the edges so at that point add in the flour and milk mixture we just made and continue heating it's over medium-high heat until it thickens slightly then add in the vanilla extract and mix it in until it's combined and then remove the saucepan from the heat and pour it through a sieve into a large bowl the reason we do this is so that it gets rid of any lumps of flour it may you want this really cold before you proceed to the next step you can place it into the fridge for four hours but a way to speed up the cooling process is to place it into a bowl filled with ice water and this process will take 20 minutes to get it scold you have to stir this mixture wallets in the ice water you don't have to stir it the whole time you can stir it and then let it sit for a few minutes then stir it again and repeat it until it's really cold you also have to make sure the bowl with the ice water remains cold cuz the ice melts quickly and if the water isn't cold it's not going to cool the mixture and then once the mixture is cold to the touch you can remove it from the ice water and then pour the mixture into an ice cream machine and churn it's for about thirty minutes if you don't have an ice cream machine watch my vanilla ice cream video and I showed you how to make its without an ice cream machine by now your brownie layers should be cold enough to handle it's ok if they're not schooled completely place them into the freezer while your ice cream mixture is turning in the ice cream machine and then crush the Oreos in a plastic bag with a rolling pin just to make them smaller don't make them really fine you want them really coarse after 30 minutes of the ice cream churning and the Oreo crumbs and turn it just for one minute don't worry if you run out of room and the ice cream machine just reserve any that you have left you'll need a springform pan sand form this ice cream cake remove the sides of the springform pan place a sheet of parchment paper on the bottom then place the sides of the springform pan back into place and cut off any excess parchment paper from around the edges you use a knife to loosen the edges of the brownie layer take your time doing this it will take a while to get it to come out but it should be really easy because we have a sheet of parchment paper on the bottom then pour on the cookies and cream ice cream if you had any leftover Oreos sprinkled them onto the top of this and place your second brownie layer on top of that and then freeze it for at least four hours you'll also want to cover it in plastic wrap I did that's off-camera and after four hours remove the plastic wrap from the top and then wrap the bottom of this springform pan in plastic wrap and place it into a bowl of warm water this is going to melt the very edges of the ice cream cake so it makes it easy to get it out of the pan the reason we wrap the bottom and plastic wrap is so that none of the water seeps into the bottom of the cake it should only take about 20 to 30 seconds so after that time remove that's from the water and remove the sides of the springform pan and then place it onto a large plate and then remove the parchment paper from underneath you can serve this immediately or wrap it in plastic wrap and store it into the freezer until you're ready to serve it and that's how to make a brownie cookies and cream ice cream cake I hope you enjoyed the video thanks for watching and I'll see you next time", "I8dYCbCdp1o": "[Music] hi welcome back I'm Cathy unfortunately rachel cannot join us today today I have a tasty recipe that I wanted to try we got a lot of requests for this one okay that's that's a flat-out lie we had no requests for it it's just I saw it and it looked delicious and then people kept sharing it so I kept seeing it over and over again so I was like okay you can just gotta try it so it is a five layer brownie cookie cheesecake so let's hit two right here it looks delicious I made it on a Sunday and here is okay so you're gonna need a ten inch springform pan an eight inch cake pan some plastic wrap some cooking spray a package of double stuffed Oreos some sugar 24 ounces of cream cheese some vanilla cookie dough eggs two boxes of your favorite brownie mix and some vegetable oil then you're going to line your springform pan with some plastic wrap you have 16 ounces of cookie dough you're going to take a bite of the cookie dough just kidding you're gonna push the cookie dough into the pan and wrap it up and put it in the freezer until you need it then after you have your brownie mix mixed up you're going to spray the pan and pour the brownie mix into your springform pan it seems like a lot but it works it's going to spray your 8-inch pan and push that down into the brownie mix and you will bake that at 350 for 35 minutes next you're going to take 24 ounces of cream cheese 1/2 a cup of sugar 1 egg and a teaspoon of vanilla you're going to mix that up until it's nice and smooth when the brownie comes out of the oven you're going to take out your 8-inch pan which that didn't stick bad so I was happy and then you put in a layer of Oreos and then you're gonna take your cheesecake batter and put that on top of the Oreos and that will bake for 40 minutes at 300 degrees then you let that cool after the cheesecake is cooled you're gonna add another layer of Oreos then you're going to get your truck and chip cookie dough out of the freezer and put that on top of the Oreos and that will bake at 300 degrees for 20 minutes I did refrigerate it overnight this thing weighs almost 7 pounds it's ridiculous as you can see there were a lot of steps and here it is I already cut it did have family in town taste it get there to set it's not as perfect as tasty there's a slice and I had one cookie left I threatened my kids not to eat it okay so I think it turned out pretty well this is a spring for pan that I used it's a ten inch if you're not aware tasty now has a line of kitchenware at Walmart you know have t buy one of the tasty brand but it's just as ten inch springform pan and I did not have the taller cake pan to use for the brownie this one is an 8 inch round and it's only 2 inches high I think the one they used was more like 3 inches but this one worked fine a lot of the comments that I saw and this is something I was wondering also it's like a brick baked the brownie part three times so it's like you would think most people think about brownies gonna be dried out so let's have a bite energy it is very good the Browning is not dried out it does not taste burnt a lot of people were thinking it would taste burnt it does not I would recommend on the Browning that you make the fudge brownie not the cake brownie I think the cake brownie probably would dry out too much we got the back of it is a little drier than the underneath part but um it does not taste burnt also notice on the tasty recipe that the cookie it looked rather doughy so I did bake that a little bit longer it still does look a little but it tastes done but you know I like cookie dough anyway so doesn't really matter our family did try it and they loved it they thought it was very good my daughter doesn't like cheesecake and she still thought this was pretty good um I am NOT a big cheesecake fan but this is pretty good I also thought another cool thing would be to try it instead of the cheesecake to use ice cream obviously you try need to make the brownie longer because obviously you wouldn't make the ice cream because you couldn't bake the cookie dough so you could bribe bake the cookie dough separate and then put it on there or another thought I had is if you put the ice cream and the Oreos that you use the cookie dough if you wanted to use raw cookie dough you know make it the safe way with pasteurized eggs and cook your flour or you can buy it in the stores now but I thought that would be another alternative to I'm gonna give this recipe a big thumbs up it is rich don't get me wrong what's up hot so sugar are going on here issue I kind of had that I was worried about is when I put this pan in there it almost seems didn't seem heavy enough because it seemed like it baked up more in the middle of than it did in the recipe so I don't know if you had any like pie weights or something that you could put in the pan to hold it down more I don't know but it still turned out and it still I think it looks it looks good if you have tried this or you decide to give it a try let us know how it turned out for you and how if you liked it or not and if you liked the video give it a thumbs up and if you haven't subscribed make sure you subscribe the bell for notifications thanks for watching

stacks of the cream inside and then this one is a mix of all three flavors and then over here we have um a brownie and then there's a oreo ice cream sandwich in the middle and topped with some mini oreos so yeah [Applause] so foreign so so favorite one is definitely the carrot cake one let's try the one with all three i don't know oh my god i didn't bring any napkins i put it back all right i'm back obviously it melted yeah um i don't know man okay let's try again so so okay that's good but really messy so so so do so so oh do thanks for watching i'll put another ball up for next video see you guys [Music] you", "xVjJoSFjZFs": "[Music] hi guys so today I would like to start by apologizing to you for my infrequency and uploading videos I've been super busy with college applications and all that fun stuff so you're just going to have to bear with me for a little bit and because I don't have that much time today I'm going to show you how to make a super quick and easy recipe for no-bake Oreo bars if you like Oreos you will love this recipe because the majority of ingredients that go in here or Oreos so let's get started in the attachment of a food processor you want to add 24 Oreo cookies or any other sandwich cookie that tastes like an Oreo along with a quarter cup of soft unsalted butter if you don't have a food processor place the cookies in a ziplock bag and bash them up with a rolling pin make sure that your butter is melted when you do this so throw on the lid and blitz the mixture until the cookies resemble the texture of wet sand you can give it a quick stir and then pour the mixture onto the bottom of a nine inch square pan that's been lined with parchment paper or foil and greased with a little bit of butter you can also use an 8 inch pen just firmly Pat the mixture down until it coats the entirety of the pan and set that aside in the refrigerator to chill in the meantime you're going to melt 250 grams of white chocolate I like to do this in the microwave stirring after every 15 seconds or until it's nice and smooth and just set that aside to cool for a little bit in yet another bowl I'm going to add 150 grams or roughly 6 ounces of cream cheese you just want to loosen it up slightly and I like to use a whisk have I mentioned that my favorite utensil in the kitchen is a whisk it's like the ultimate superhero of kitchen tools now stream in that decadent white chocolate lava and watch the mixture transform into a white chocolate cheesecake lover's paradise we're approaching the best part the Oreos I'm going to dice up 12 or eyo cookies quite finely you can do bigger chunks if you prefer it that way when you're satisfied with that Oreo rubble just tumble it into the white chocolate mixture thoroughly fold in those Oreo bits to combine and as you can see the mixtures already solidifying quite nicely and when you're after this beautiful black and white speckled mass you're going to dollop the mixture atop that cool and spread it out as evenly as you can muster when it comes to desserts and only two desserts I'm a little bit of a perfectionist so I really try to get the top as smooth as possible but you do not have to do this especially because you're now going to top that tray off with six more chopped Oreos I think it adds a beautiful finish a little bit more of a contrast between the black and white chill the tray for a minimum of two hours or until it is nice and solidified and then for an absolute final touch I like to drizzle the top with a little bit of bittersweet chocolate about a hundred grams or four ounces or so I think the dark chocolate really cuts through that sweetness of the white chocolate well so I strongly urge you to add it and you can slice them up into Mars this makes about 16 pieces of cookies and cream decadent they are an absolute dream to cut through because they're firm and the texture is still so creamy and has a slight crunch from those Oreos I gave these to a friend at school and she said that she went from having an okay to having an excellent day after eating them look at them how can you not like these they are the perfect solution to any problem and if you'd like to make these go-to hot chocolate hits calm for the full recipe and I hope you love these as much as I do thank you guys so much for watching as always I really hope you enjoyed learning how to make these no-bake Oreo bars and if you did please give me a thumbs up and leave me a comment down below telling me what you thought or what you would like to see me make this fall or what you're going to be making this fall and I will see you next time bye bye", "nux4jTlJGks": "squares may fit into the category of cookies because their batters are more cookie like than cake like but if you love squares you know they're a category all on their own I'll start by showing you the fundamentals a fudge brownie I love adding nuts to brownies I have a cup of pecan halves but I'm not going to add them raw I want to roast them first and I don't want to just roast them I want to salt roast them so I'm gonna take just a tablespoon of butter and melt it in a saute pan over medium-high heat now I can add the pecans in goes a half a teaspoon of sea salt the salt will cling on to the nuts as they're toasting and when I chop them up and put them in the brownies you get those little crunchy bits of sea salt you want to keep the pecans moving in the pan as you toast them so they Brown evenly it takes about eight minutes to get them a nice golden brown I'll set these aside to cool so I can start on the brownie batter itself now what I've got here is four ounces of unsweetened chocolate that means this is intense I've chopped it up and I'm gonna add it directly to the pot but I'm not going to melt it just on its own I'll add a cup and a quarter of butter cup and a quarter is 10 ounces stir this over medium heat unsweetened chocolate is the only style of chocolate you can really truly melt over direct heat this is because unsweetened chocolate is the most stable of the chocolates there's no added elements it's just the pure cocoa solids I've got what looks like a beautiful chocolate sauce but of course there's no sugar in this whisk in a cup of regular sugar first and then 3/4 of a cup of light brown sugar I like using a bit of brown sugar in my brownie recipes because it just adds an intensity of flavor and that added moisture that in and now for the eggs three eggs and I'll add them one at a time now something that's important is to make sure you whisk or mix your brownie batter by hand never in a mixer because the added air will fluff up the brownies and then you'll end up with a cake style brownie so just mix your brownie batter by hand and mix it gently you can feel the batters start to thicken up with the addition of the eggs now a good two teaspoons of vanilla and just a cup of all-purpose flour because I don't want these brownies to be light and airy I'm not going to sift the flour into the brownie mix I switched to a spatula now just to make sure I can get into the corners of the sauce pot and I stir it just until it's blended to pump up the chocolate flavor a quarter cup of cocoa powder because cocoa powder has lumps I do sift this in a brownie recipe doesn't need to have baking soda or baking powder in it because I don't want it to rise up and be fluffy and because I have the salt toasted pecans I don't need to add salt if you're making just plain brownies then I would add half a teaspoon of salt to this recipe what I'm gonna do is set aside 12 pecan halves for the top of the brownies and the rest I'll chop up coarsely how easy is that a good brownie recipe is a perfect way to introduce yourself not just to the world of squares but even the world of baking all together using an ice cream scoop I'm portioning these into an actual square pan these are made for brownies if you don't have a pan like this you can simply use an 8-inch square pan once you feed the brownies to your friends and family and get that welcome response that gets you hooked on baking the pan has been greased and the finishing touch is a pecan on top of each brownie baking brownies is where I first got fascinated with the magic of baking because you take this gooey brown mixture and you put it in the oven and as it bakes it transforms into luscious fudgy brownies I've preheated the oven to 350 and these take just 20 minutes to bake you know when they're done when the surface of the brownie just loses its shine yeah they've got that matte surface to them so these brownies are done probably the only hard part about brownies is that you have to let them cool in the pan for an hour before you eat them but once cooled just like these you can pop them out or if you're baking them in a square pan cut them into brownie shapes and they're ready to serve because of the density of the brownies and the moisture they stay fresh for days but it's rare that they're around longer than a day [Music]", "IBnnd7fFduc": "hey guys whittling our sweet fried is still making some cookies and cream mug cake the things are made to be some white chocolate chips some milk some flour some baking powder some vegetable oil some cookies some Oreo cookies and a mug so um I've already put in my one-fourth cup of white chocolate chips three tablespoons of milk and then I put it in the microwave for 40 seconds then I whisk it it a little bit but now I'm gonna whisk it just a little bit more to mention that I got all of the chunks out

bars enjoy your swaggy sweets", "lNmNEwiJTC4": "first things first I have preheated my oven to 350 degrees and here I have a 9-inch glass baking dish and once you lightly sprays this with some nonstick spray and then set this off to the side the brownies I'm just going to use a standard and you can see that I'm just going to use a standard fudge brownie mix and I'm going to mix this by hand basically just follow the box instructions add that the mix as well as 2/3 of the cup of vegetable oil and a quarter cup of water and 2 eggs 1 and 2 I'm just going to mix this until it comes together you don't want to over mix it lumps are perfectly fine and actually preferred in this just like that and I'm going to pour this into my baking pan just like that and I'm going to kind of jiggle this to level it out and I'm going to put this in my preheated oven for according to the package instructions for this for a 9 by 9 it says 48 / 38 to 40 minutes so I'll check it after about 35 while our brownies are baking I'm going to go ahead and make the cookie dome in my mixer here I've got one and a half cups of softened butter you can use margarine you can use a combination like I'm doing here whatever you happen to have I'm going to add 3/4 of a cup of brown sugar I'm also going to add in 1/2 cup of white sugar and I'm just going to mix this until it is light and fluffy until it looks about like that and because we're going to leave this cookie dough raw you don't want to put eggs in it I don't have a problem eating raw eggs but some people might so in place of the eggs I'm going to add in a quarter of a cup of milk I'm just going to mix this in and every once in a while you'll want to turn your mixer off and scrape down the sides of the bowl and you can by all means do this by hand it's not too terribly difficult okay and to this I'm going to add my flour and I've already gone ahead and added half a teaspoon of salt to this flour I'm just going to have the flour in all at one time it might splash up and make a mess but it cleans just start it on low speed and again I'm going to stop and scrape down the sides just like that and then I'm going to add hmmm got all my fingers I'm going to add in half or one cup of mini chocolate chips and then finally give this a stir and then I'm just going to scrape down the bowl and scrape down the beater more cookie dough my fingers scrape down the bowl and the beater and I'm just going to set this in the refrigerator until our brownies are done alright my brownies are done and I just checked at 32 minutes and insert a knife into the center and it came out clean so they are done so all in all it was 32 minutes box of 38 to 40 not always just double check now I'm going to let this completely cool before I put my cookie dough on top and when this is cool I will be back so my brownies are completely cool now and I'm just going to take my cookie dough and put it out on top here just like that and one thing I forgot to mention when I was making the cookie dough I forgot to put the vanilla in it I went ahead and added that after I got this all mixed together so don't forget that and all I'm going to do is take this cookie dough and I'm going to spread it over the top of these brownies I'm just trying to get it as even as possible on the top it doesn't have to be perfect just like that make sure you get it all the way over the corners and kind of press it down into the brownies that will help stick just like that and then I'm going to go ahead and put this into a refrigerator overnight so it gets nice and cold and firms up nice and solid if you want to you can take additional chocolate chips mini chocolate chips and sprinkle the top I wasn't planning on doing this but chocolate chips just sitting here so I figure might as well use them alright I pack go ahead and put this in the refrigerator and slice it up when you're ready to serve and there you have it chocolate chip cookie dough

yummy and soft chocolate fudge brownies are ready to be served thanks for watching stay tuned", "C4WMYq690jI": "hello everyone today we're going to make chocolate chip cookie dough brownies these are decadent delicious and amazing hello everyone today's recipe comes from this book it is the cookie dough lovers cookbook by Lindsay Landis I bought this book on Amazon I'll put a link in the description if you're interested in picking it up there I'm sure you can probably get it at your local bookstore as well it is fantastic and I know if I can find three or four recipes out of cookbook that it was well worth the money and I actually found more than that in this book it's great so to start off you'll need an 8 by 8 inch or an 8 by 10 inch of baking dish and you need to line it with parchment so what I did is I sprayed a little bit of cooking spray in the bottom I put one piece of parchment paper lengthwise and one piece of parchment paper with wise overlapping and you see how it covers up the inside quite nicely then spray lightly with a little bit of cooking spray in a small bowl combine 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1 tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa mix that together without spilling it all over your countertop now in a large bowl place 1/3 of a cup of butter and three and a half ounces of semi-sweet chocolate you can use chocolate chips or you can use the chocolate in bar form put it in the microwave for about one or two minutes on high until the butter is melted and when you give it a good stir the chocolate chips melt as well when that's nice and smooth add 2/3 of a cup of brown sugar and blend that together and continue to stir it or you could also use a whisk until the sugar is well combined and the temperature of the mixture has cooled down quite a bit then add one teaspoon of vanilla and two eggs did you catch that yes I did take out that little piece of eggshell before I continued stirring the eggs now add the dry ingredients the cocoa powder salt and flour and begin to fold it in and continue to fold just keep folding just keep folding until you don't see any more flour and once you get to that point no more dry flour you can stop mixing because you don't want to overbeat this mixture then pour it into your prepared pan and then you're going to bake this at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes until when you stick a toothpick in the center it comes out clean and then you need to let this cool completely before we go on to the next step which is making the cookie dough portion now in a medium-sized Bowl that should be able lot smaller than this one place 1/2 cup of packed brown sugar 1/4 cup of white granulated sugar and 1/2 cup of unsalted butter blend up together with an electric mixer or by hand until it is a light and fluffy Johnson then add 2 tablespoons of milk or cream I'm using cream because I happen to have some in the refrigerator at the time and blend that together and here as you can see a smaller bowl will probably make it a lot easier but I scrape down the sides of the bowl until I got something that was really really smooth now adding in some flour 3/4 of a cup of all-purpose flour and 1/4 teaspoon of salt and stir that together until it is combined and you'll end up with something that looks like a cookie dough which makes a lot of sense and then finally 1/2 cup of miniature semi-sweet chocolate chips and just stir those in until they're combined the next step is to spread that cookie dough mixture over the top of your cooled brownies and spread it out nice and even and the put in the refrigerator all you make the topping that's three and a half ounces of semi-sweet chocolate chips and two tablespoons of unsalted butter put that in the microwave for about a minute or two until the butters melted and when you give it a stir the chocolate chips should melt up nicely as well then take that topping mixture and pour it over top of the cookie dough spread it around evenly and a good trick for chocolate is if you give it a shake or a tap the surface of the chocolate will smooth out a little bit and then put in the refrigerator until it is set then remove it from the pan and that's what's great about that parchment paper you can just lift it out it put it on your cutting board and then you're going to slice it in 2 bars or in two squares now this actually stores quite nicely at room temperature you don't have to keep it in the fridge and there are the completed cookie dough brownies these are amazing I took these to a work get-together and I tell you on the dessert table these went first and you can always tell it's a great dessert delicious you've got that wonderful chocolate coating on the top a nice squishy kind of buttery creamy cookie dough layer in the middle then a really nice dense chocolate brownie in the bottom fantastic dessert give it a try now on your screen now is a recipe for peanut butter chocolate chip cookies

hopefully all of you are doing well if you're not you about to be today we're going to be making some  cheesecake brownies yes it has a questionable name but that is what they're called because these cheesecake brownies are doing way way too much let's get going on the brownie mix first so we have two eggs down in the stand mixer and I have a quarter cup of brown sugar and a half a cup of white sugar I'm just going to blend that together next I'm just going to go ahead and add my vanilla extract the melted butter and some cream cheese why not since we have a cream cheese top I decided to go ahead and put a little cream cheese in those brownies to give them some extra moisture for the exact measurements to this recipe check out GD seasoning calm the link will be below in the description now as far as the dry ingredients we have flour cocoa powder a little bit of expresso baking powder and some salt real easy this is not a temperamental brownie mix at all once we're done sifting all of the dry ingredients we're going to slowly add it to the wet ingredients while we blend you can also use a hand mixer but go ahead and mix it just until the batter comes together do not over mix your brownie batter for this recipe I'm going to be using an 8x8 baking dish you can get away with a nine by nine if that's what you have I lightly buttered or you can spray the dish itself and then I took two pieces of parchment paper and crisscross them gave them a good spray and that's going to help me lift the cheesecake brownies right out of the dish now all we're going to do is just pour our brownie mix right into the dish and spread it out evenly alright our brownie layer is done we're just going to bake it at 350 degrees for 15 minutes in the meantime let's get going on that cheesecake batter in the stand mixer I have a pound of room-temperature cream cheese that I'm going to add some sugar to only a half a cup we're going to add some vanilla extract I'm also going to add a little bit of salt and two eggs that's it this cheesecake layer is really simple easy and to the point one of the things I discovered making this recipe over and over is that these desserts served on their own are rich and decadent within themselves but to slam them together they have to be done with some sort of finesse so that's why some of the sugar is pulled back to make allowances for some of the other sugar in the other desserts yeah I'm saying I'm saying you'll see what I'm doing here now is was taking my spatula making sure all of my cream cheese batter is mixed in very well and we're going to take those brownies out of the oven this brownie layer is nowhere near set but that's what we want we're going to move on and place all of our Oreo cookies right on the top of that and we're going to cover the Oreos with the Cheesecake better make sure you don't dump all of the cheesecake batter right in the center of the Oriels what you're going to do is move that brownie batter on the bottom so make sure you do it in a zigzag pattern and then take your time with a spatula and spread the cheesecake batter over the Oreos very neat finally we're just going to take 8 to 10 chopped Oreos and put them right on top of the cheesecake batter and we're going to bake it continue to bake it at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes just until the cheesecake layer is set then we're going to let it cool to room temperature for 2 and 1/2 to 3 hours and then refrigerate it for 6 to 8 hours so this is an overnight situation it was going to take it out see how that parchment paper made it easy for me to lift it right out and then I was feeling a little extra I went on and made a white chocolate ganache you can make any ganache you want or none at all I just wanted to drizzle it over the top give it a nice flare and then you can cut them up and serve them here's the deal with cutting these you want to make sure you clean the knife every time you cut it so your cuts will be clean I remember that right there like oh let me clean my life and come back because if you just keep cutting them the brownie layer is going to get stuck to the cheesecake layer and your cuts won't be clean so take a look at that see how the cuts are nice and clean and you can see all the layers Oreo cookie the brownie cheesecake the chocolate on top is just decadent at its best now for kicks and giggles I had some extra white chocolate left I decided to make another batch of these brownies or these cheesecake brownies and decided to bake them still at the same temperature for 38 minutes without any Oreos on top the steps are still the same you need to let it cool for 2 and 1/2 to 3 hours and I took my leftover white chocolate and poured it over the cold cheesecake batter on top spreaded that around evenly and then I put Oreos on top of that and then I put it in the refrigerator for six to eight hours man let me tell you now that right there is rich these were so rich I decided to cut them into twelve pieces instead of nine when you cut them with a knife you can hear the snap of the chocolate topping and the brownie is moist but I'm telling you it is a little sweeter because we use more white chocolate if you want to you can also make a semi-sweet chocolate ganache remember to try to serve these as close to room temperature as possible that way your brownie will have a nice chew to it against that creamy cheesecake thank you guys so much for cooking with me and hanging out you know I appreciate it don't forget this recipe and others can be found at Judy seasoning calm and I'll see you guys next time", "pyiRoPiDt30": "(upbeat music) - Hi friends. - Hey. - Welcome back to cook with\nApril on tasty Tuesdays, sorry we were on a mini-break. I gave birth to Jacob, our second son. He is now a month old and we're getting into the routine of things again. - We sure are, yeah.\n- Yeah. So we wanted to celebrate with a delicious red velvet brownie...\n- Woah. cheesecake. It's so good you guys, I already tried it, oh my gosh, you guys have to\nstay tuned and watch this. So here's the ingredients\nthat you'll need. You'll need granulated white\nsugar, all purpose flour, three eggs, you're going to\nneed two for the brownie, one for the cheesecake. Cocoa powder, unsweetened. And then you'll need melted\nbutter, red food coloring, vanilla extract, vinegar, salt, another measurement of sugar as well as vanilla extract\nfor the cheesecake, and then eight ounces of cream\ncheese for the cheesecake. So let's get started. So before we begin, let's\ngo ahead and preheat our oven to 350 degrees. So now we're gonna mix the\nmelted butter into a large bowl, we're gonna mix that with\nthe granulated white sugar. Now you're ready to add\nthe vanilla extract. The distilled vinegar, the salt, the cocoa powder, and this requires a lot more mixing. (upbeat music) Now we're gonna add the food coloring, this is red food coloring, this is what makes it that beautiful red. And I'm gonna use this entire container of red food coloring. I'm just gonna gradually stir it in there. (upbeat music) To make the brownie a little\nbit more vibrant and red, I added another container\nof red food coloring, but you can skip that. I mean, if you just want\nit to look slightly red, that's fine. Now you're ready to add the eggs, I'm doing it one at a time. Now you're ready to stir. (upbeat music) And now stir. (upbeat music) Now you're ready to add the\nall purpose white flour. I like to gradually add it. (upbeat music) So you're gonna keep a\nquarter cup of that batter, and save that for later for\nputting on top of the cheesecake so I just have it saved right here. And now you're ready to\npour the rest of the batter into and eight by eight greased pan. (upbeat music) So in another bowl, you're\ngonna place your cream cheese, the eight ounces of cream cheese that's been in room temperature, if not, just like pop it in the microwave 'til it's slightly softened, but not like completely softened. And then you're ready to mix it with the granulated white sugar,\nand let's go ahead and mix. Then you're ready to\nadd the vanilla extract, and continue to mix. (upbeat music) Last step is to add the egg, and mix. (upbeat music) So now you're ready to pour\nthat cream cheese batter right on top of the red\nvelvet brownie batter. (upbeat music) So remember that quarter\ncup of the brownie, we're gonna just drizzle\nit on top of the batter. But the thing is, it's\nthick, so it's kinda hard. But we're gonna keep trying you guys, it doesn't matter though. We're gonna just try and drizzle it. We're gonna try to make a\nlittle swirl action happen. And I'm using a chopstick to kinda like scoop it out you guys. (upbeat music) So do you guys see how it looks like? So just grab whatever,\nlike a knife, a spoon, and just kind of like make a swirl action. Do you guys see that? Look how pretty! It's gonna look so delightfully\ndelicious and pretty. You see how like, ooooh you guys see that? I'm so excited. (April laughing) There's no science to it, just like try to do a swirl action. I think I'm pretty much done, you know? So that's how it should look like, or kinda sort of. And now you're ready to\nbake this at 350 degrees, for 30 to 35 minutes. (upbeat music) Alright, taste tester time. - Alright. - You guys, one day Jacob's\ngonna be a taste tester like\n- I know. Daddy and Liam.\n- I know, right? Look at how beautiful this is.\n- Oh it's gorgeous. - First of all, the swirl you guys.\n- Yes, that swirl. - Perfection. Okay, I'm ready to do this. I got my milk.\n- He was gonna describe how it looked. - This is amazing. - Thank you.\n- This... - I love it too, it's so moist. - The cheesecake is so fluffy. - Yes. - The brownie is incredibly moist. - Oh yes. - I've never had a bite of\nlike cheesecake and brownie at the same time. - Yes. - Amazing. - I love it.\n- This is really really good. - And the cheesecake is not too sweet. - Yeah, it isn't. - Right? I love that about it.\n- If you guys notice that's always one of my comments, I don't like super sweet\ncheesecake, or super sweet desserts and this is perfect. - Oh I love it. - And Pinterest worthy, I\nthink it's Pinterest worthy, what do you guys think?\n- Oh absolutely.

Bye.\n- Bye.", "biHWjiQ7B-g": "- Is there anything better than a rich fudgy brownie, or a light fluffy cheesecake? How about a cheesecake brownie? Hey you're watching Preppy Kitchen where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make delicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends. And today it is a super easy treat that is sure to please. Fudgy brownie on the bottom, light and fluffy perfectly\ntangy cheesecake on top, and a pretty marbleized top\nthat's just beyond easy. You're gonna love these. Let's get started. First off we're gonna add one full cup, or 226 grams of melted unsalted\nbutter into a largish bowl. Here's the deal, we're gonna be adding in 1 1/3 cups of semi sweet chocolate chips. Stirring it up a little bit. It's starting to melt already, but we're gonna give this like a couple 20 second burst in the microwave to move it along a bit. You could've melted the butter and the chocolate chips together, but I get worried about people doing that because burnt things\nhappen in that microwave and it's sad when you like seize all this chocolate and it's this inexpensive waste. So just melt the butter separately, give it a head start, and then we are going to\nmicrowave this on short bursts. Be back in a moment. Two 25 secondish bursts later, I stirred in between, you can see the chocolate\nis nice and melted. This is gonna be a buttery\nchocolatey brownie, which is exactly how I like it. A bready brownie is\nlike a chocolate muffin, which is not cool. Anyhow, we're gonna add in three quarters of a cup of cocoa powder. Don't forget, one teaspoon of salt. Salt and chocolate go hand in hand. You need to like have, a little bit of a bite with the sugar, and the, kind of a, deep rich flavor of the cocoa powder. You might know this already, but when you're adding in cocoa powder to warm butter and chocolate, you're blooming it so\nyou're really kind of waking up that cocoa flavor and intensifying that\nrich, fudgy amazingness. This is gonna be good. If you have a little bits of\nchocolate that aren't melted, don't worry about it. You're basically having\nlittle mini chocolate chips left in your brownie, and they will melt in the oven. Okay that's nice and amazing. Now it's time for the sugars, and I will say this is\nan indulgent dessert. If you needed to reduce sugars, you could take out a 1/3 of a\ncup of each if you wanted to. That's one cup of white sugar, 200 grams, and one cup of brown\nsugar, also 200 grams. Wow. I mean, can you even. If you had a bad day and\ncame home to this brownie with the cheesecake on top. Your day would be turned around. Taking a pause right now just to measure out one cup of flour, that's 120 grams. Click up here for my \"How\nto Measure Flour\" video. So many times I get comments saying people followed a\nrecipe but something went left. I tell you like 90% of the time it's because of mismeasured ingredients and it's not your fault. It's because people have been\nteaching you to use cups, and you can pack so much in here, like force it in, and most recipes are calling\nfor more specific amounts. So, get a kitchen scale. It doesn't have to be a fancy one, and it'll make a huge\ndifference in your baking. Right now I'm adding in\na tablespoon of coffee. Of course, if you watch my videos, or follow many other people you know that, coffee wakes that chocolate flavor up. You're not gonna taste coffee because there's a tablespoon\nof coffee in there. One tablespoon of a nice vanilla. Vanilla is amazing. I've had some people ask like, \"Do you put vanilla in everything?\" and I'm like well, yes. Not everything but many things. Okay give this stir, and earlier I said a\nlargish bowl that was wrong it should be a large bowl, large. But it's okay, we'll make it work. Alright time to add in\nthe two eggs and one yolk, room temperature please. Give this a really good mix. You could use an electric\nmixer for this but. And if you're wondering, \"Why is there a trivet under here?\" it's not because something is hot, it's because this counter is cold and I was getting annoyed with the counter chilling things too much. I've had a couple viewers tell me to use some kitchen towels underneath so, I'm taking that suggestion\nand modifying it. Okay nice and mixed in. Now it's time for the last ingredient, one cup, 120 grams, of all-purpose flour. This is a fudgy brownie, not a cakey brownie. It's gonna work, this bowl will work. So I don't need any leavening agents, and you don't want that much flour. It's really just kind\nof to hold it together. Okay switched to a spatula. Just gonna finish mixing this up by hand, cause I'm basically folding in the flour, and all I'm doing is looking for any like, unmixed pockets. So it wouldn't be the end of the world but you know I like a homogenous mixture. Okay. Oh my gosh. So luscious. I got a gift from this Etsy seller when I was buying some\nstuff for the kitchen. I wanna show it to you. I was like, \"What is this?\". So dumb I would never use it, but then I was like, \"This is amazing I'm\ngonna use this everyday\". Look at these, they're tiny little spoons which I thought were ridiculous, but I realized would be\na perfect tasting spoon. It's like one spoon, you\ndon't double dip, et cetera. That was really good. Okay. It's gonna be even better when it's baked. Living on the edge. I prepped the 9x9 inch baking pan, and you could do this in\nan 8x8 so it'll be thicker, you could do it in, a 9x13 if you divide\nit off with some foil, and back the foil up, and put the paper in. That what I did actually on the blog post. If you look really carefully\nat the process shots because I hadn't ordered a 9x9 inch pan. But I got it so I'm using it. Alright into the bowl. Wow look at these ribbons of amazingness. Could you say no to that? This is gonna be criminally delicious. Just gonna move this to\nthe edges of the pan. It will self, well, this is a two layer dessert so you do wanna kinda move it out a bit. The parchment paper is\ngonna save your life after this is baked, because I've had brownies stuck in the pan and it is not pretty. Especially when you have to photograph it. Perfect. This one gets set aside and now we're gonna do our easy, breezy, delicious cheesecake topping. Okay. Set aside. This cheesecake topping\ncomes together in a snap. All you need is that 16 ounces or two packages of cream cheese, and it should be room temperature but mine was ice cold because I forgot to take\nit out ahead of time. So just microwave it in like little 30 second bursts. Two should be fine. This is kinda messy though now so don't mind me. I don't know why cream\ncheese is so amazing, but it is amazing. You can click up here\nfor my Oreo cheesecake. There's a ton of cheesecake\nstuff on the blog too. And I'm all ears if you have any cheesecake suggestions for me. If you ever have a problem, it's because one, this\nwasn't mixed up enough, and two, it might've been\ncold and it got lumps. It's not gonna make the taste change, but it just won't look as smooth. So just stir, stir, stir or beep, beep, beep. I would let this mix on like mediumish for maybe like four minutes. Just walkaway, do some\ncleaning, and come back. You'll be happy about it, trust me. I'm gonna scrape that bowl down. Now we're gonna run this on lowish. And then add 1/2 of a cup of sugar. Let that beat in. Now you should scrape the bowl, and before it was just for form sake, but here I see some sugar hanging out. Not about that. So now, one tablespoon of vanilla. So smooth and glossy I love it. And now two eggs, room temperature once again please. Add one in, let it mix. Number two. God I love the way cream\ncheese taste so much. No lumps. Nice and smooth. And look at this, it looks so gorgeous. I wanna drink this bowl so\nbad I can't even tell you. It's literally just for\nyou that I'm not doing it. So we're gonna pour this in now and it should level itself out, but you know, you can move it around. So get all that batter out. Okay now let's give it a little spread because what we're gonna do is add those dollops in and\nit's gonna be really fun. Now it's time to go back to that 1/2 cup of reserved brownie batter, plop it into a bowl with one tablespoon of hot, hot water. So what we wanna do is thin the batter out so that it's going to\nbe able to swirl around. Kinda making like a brownie soup almost. Delicious soup. If you wanna use a whisk, it's probably a better idea. While I'm sharing, you know how you like, have a recipe that you do all the time and you're like \"I know this recipe\", and you ended up doing\nsomething slightly different. Well in this recipe I\ndidn't check the blog post, and I just mixed in\nall the chocolate chips instead of reserving\nsome for mixing in later, but that's fine. Either way is totally acceptable. So if you like that chocolate chip life, just reserve some. Mix them at the end. Now you can see this is much more, kind of like, swirlable. Which is exactly what we want. Okay so, now the fun part. We're gonna take like\ntablespoon sized dollops of the thinned out batter and add them to the brownie mixture here. It could be like randomly placed. It doesn't have to be in any pattern. This might now look amazing\nright now but it will. Take a skewer, my favorite kitchen tool of all, and we're gonna begin just\nswirling things around. So, at first it's gonna look kind of janky, but then some swirl magical happen. Look at that. Take my swirls very seriously. It's like level 10 concentration. So once you're happy with like the pattern you've created with your swirls, this is gonna go into the\noven for 30 minutes or so, at 350 fahrenheit, and you're gonna see like the top have that cheesecake magic and the bottom is gonna have like, a very fudgy brownie texture. So it's gonna be delightful. Okay look how beautifully this baked. It's amazing. This baked for about 35 minutes. I left it in a little bit longer and just turned the oven off, let it hang out there\nfor like 30 minutes or so just because I wanted\nto have a really nice unmarred top without the cracks. Let it come to room temperature. Then I put it in the fridge\nfor a bit just to firm up because taking it out, you kinda wanna like, give it a test, see what's happening, and then that. This is why I wanted to show you that. If you didn't have this paper, you'd be in trouble, and if you used foil, like just don't use foil it's so messy, for this purpose, and it's much more easy to rip foil when you're pulling it out. This came out nicely. We're gonna give us a cut\nand then give it a taste. I like the corner pieces in case I ever go to your house. That is a fudgy brownie, just like I like it. Look at that. This is so nice and fudgy, and that cheesecake is flufftastic and so light with a perfect right tang. Okay. Look into my cheesecake brownie. (mumbles) Time for a bite. Okay. I've been looking forward\nto this let me tell you. That top. (hums in agreement) I mean it's really good. Is it rich? Yes, it is very rich. Is that wrong? No, it's not wrong. Okay I'm just gonna eat this but I need to say goodbye. So, if you like this recipe, check out my Oreo cheesecake recipe. It is so good. Full of Oreos and just like, it's plain delicious.

cohen editorial director here at feed feed and today we're making one of my favorite cookies these are not just brownie cookies these are olive oil brownie cookies there's so much fruitier and they're gonna be your new favorite chocolaty treat so why would you make a brownie cookie and not just brownies well that simple it's because I'm impatient and I want my dessert and I want it now so these come together super quickly only a few ingredients as you can see kind of the same basis of a typical brownie so let's get started we're gonna chop up some dark chocolate about 8 ounces I just want small even pieces and they'll help it melt super quickly I'm using 70% dark chocolate that's kind of like my go-to or a baking recipe that being said if you are super into like the bitter dark rich notes of like 85% or even a 90 you do you we're gonna throw this right into a double boiler I have over here reminder what is double boiler it is a bold heat proof of course over a little saucepan of simmering water we do not want the bowl itself touching the water so it's only being heated by the steam and that's how you know you're going to melt your chocolate not burning it right so we are making a ganache what a ganache is is it is melted chocolate mixed with some type of fat or liquid sometimes it's heavy cream sometimes it's butter sometimes the combos the two today we're doing it with olive oil I'm just gonna add in a quarter cup of just whatever fruity olive oil you have on hands perfect we let this melt whisk it together until it's homogenous and then we'll happen smooth shiny delicious I'm taking our flower and I'm going to whisk in the rest of our dry ingredients so it's nice and incorporated before we add it into the batter so we have 3/4 of a cup of all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder you want to use nice quality nice quality chocolate nice quality cocoa powder as well as 1 teaspoon of kosher salt and 1 teaspoon of baking powder just whisk that together nice and incorporated and then this is what we will add in later last once we have the full batter together now we are going to get going on these brownie cookies this start a combo of brown sugar and white sugar 2/3 of a cup of brown sugar 2 1/3 of a cup of white sugar why white sugar gives it that craggily like crunchy crisp papery top the brown sugar makes it nice and chewy and absolutely incredible you need both I'm going to throw in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and two eggs we're gonna whisk it together until it is nice and smooth and light in color putting a little elbow grease or make sure all that brown sugar is dissolved if you have a few lumps here and there do not worry when we add in the warm chocolate ganache it will melt all of it but you can see this mixture is already getting lighter in color and that's how you know that you're incorporating a bit of air just gonna help make the cookies light and fluffy let's add in the chocolate right into the eggs I'm so excited you can smell the olive oil it's so fragrant it adds like the perfect like fruity note to the chocolate I think it like anything with acid like olive oil or like I often times will add sumac to anything with chocolate anything with acidity kind of brings out like all the flavors of chocolate and makes any chocolate taste better this is together we're gonna add in our dry ingredients gentle at first so you don't end up with flour all over the counter we want this thicker than brownie batter because we're picking these into cookies and you do not want them just spread out into pancakes now we're just gotten 1 cup of milk chocolate chips you could use semi-sweet you can use dark you can use white even if you want to go really crazy like this is kind of your time to add in whatever flavors you'd like peanut butter tips would also be pretty great in this tbh so I have tried this recipe many times tested it through and through here at Fifi and I actually found out that the cookies were not only fluffier I think also had such a better appearance and like crispy crackled top when I baked them straight from making the matter itself it adds one more layer of like you don't have to wait so long for your dessert we're going to scoop 2 tbsp sized little balls of batter you can use a spoon don't try to like roll it with your hands it'll melt and just make a mess I love a little mini ice cream scoop if not use two spoons you just kind of like get them down they don't have to be perfectly round and want to show you my trick after they so let's just get scooping [Music] for these cookies go into the oven or give them a little extra love of some of the APC salt on the top as you can see I spaced them out about 2 to 3 inches apart you want to make sure they do not bake into each other they'll give a nice healthy sprinkle I'm a salty boy so I like a heavy sprinkle so now we are going to pop these into the oven we're at 350 only 8 to 10 minutes these cookies bake super quickly and they're going to be nice and I got those beautiful cracked top and they're gonna be melty and chocolatey and let's just get them in the oven so I can eat them [Music] the cookies are out of the oven as you could see they're a little misshapen but I mean so am I so you go in with a cookie cutter and you just roll it around and that helps make it into a perfect circle I do it quickly as soon as it's out of the oven so chocolatey it's rich but the milk chocolate adds the perfect sweetness the olive oil adds fruitiness the salt brings it all together this is the perfect brownie cookie if you want the recipe head to the Fifi calm and I'll see you next time [Music]", "GDxVzNCp_ns": "- Hi guys, it's Lainey and welcome back to Cookie Mondays. Today I will be sharing\nwith you how to make Oreo cheesecake cookies. Thank you so much for voting\nfor these cookies guys and let's begin. You're only going to\nneed five ingredients: crushed Oreos, all-purpose flour, cream cheese that is softened, sugar, and butter that is room temperature. And you can get the complete recipe at my blog Simplybakings.com. In a large bowl you're going\nto add the cream cheese and take your handheld mixer, or you can use your stem mixer,\nand you're going to mix it. Then you're going to add the\nbutter and continue mixing it until it is well combined. And don't forget guys\nif you would like to get all my latest recipes,\nhit the subscribe button. (light guitar music) Next grab the sugar, add it to the bowl, and continue mixing until\nit is light and fluffy. Make sure to scrape the sides\nso all of the ingredients will be mixed in and combine very well. So once it's mixed in very well, gradually add the all-purpose flour. Once you're finished adding the flour, add the Oreos, and you're\ngoing to fold it in. And what's really neat about this recipe it does not have eggs, so\nyou can actually just eat it straight from the bowl before you bake it. So once the Oreos are folded in, cover up the batter and\nyou're going to place this in the refrigerator for at least an hour. If you are in a hurry,\nyou can actually place it in the freezer for about 30 minutes. So after it's been in the refrigerator, you're going to take it out and you're going to place the\ndough into the cookie pan. So I used my cookie scooper and placed it onto the cookie pan and I\nflattened it a little bit, baked it at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 12 to 13 minutes. Once the cookies were done baking, I placed them on a cookie\nrack and allowed it to sit for about five more minutes, and then I took my first\nbite of these cookies. And it was really good. I could really taste the cream cheese, and it wasn't as sweet\nas I thought it would. I love the crunchiness from the Oreos and, overall, it was such a great cookie. It's question time. Rahaf asked, \"Hey, I\nalways see your videos \"and I wanted to ask what I\ncan use instead of candy melts \"since it's not available in my country.\" So what I used to do because I didn't know candy melts existed, I\nwould use chocolate chips and do the double boiler method and add some shortening gradually\nto thin out the chocolate. Great question and if\nyou guys have any more let me know in the comment section. Happy baking! \u266b Ohh Thank you guys so much for watching. If you like this video,\nplease give it a thumbs up.

but everybody also has a preference when it comes to brownies whether they like them fudgy like this version here or cakey like this one here so let me show you how to do that there are five basic ingredients in a brownie batter chocolate butter flour sugar and eggs but if you play with the ratio you're gonna end up with a different outcome so a fudgy brownie or a cakey brownie the ingredients that will change the overall texture are fats so that is the chocolate and the butter and also the flour ratio so in a fudgy brownie you're going to have more chocolate and more butter than a cakey brownie and you're going to have less flour than you would in a cakey brownie and if you like cakey brownies you're gonna need a little bit of baking powder for that as well so I personally like a fudgy brownie so I'm gonna start with that today into a bowl set over some simmering water I have 6 ounces of bittersweet chocolate you're making your cakey brownie that would be 4 ounces of chocolate so a little less and I'm going to add a stick of unsalted butter right into the bowl now if you were doing your cakey brownie you would only use a half a stick of butter here so this is gonna melt together until it's nicely combined and then we're gonna add the rest of the ingredients so our chocolate and butter mixture is melted and combined I'm going to remove it from the heat and you want to make sure that you wipe off any condensation that collects on the bottom of the bowl you don't want to incorporate that into your chocolate because it will make your chocolate C's and to this I'm going to add the sugar if you wanted a chewy brownie a lot of people like chewy brownies you can add brown sugar but today I'm adding granulated sugar and this is one and a half cups and this is one of the core ingredients that does not change so I'm just going to gently stream this in while I'm whisking so that it melts into the hot chocolate and butter mixture it helps to cool the chocolate mixture down a little but before we add the eggs this is another ingredient that's going to stay the same whether you're making a fudgy or a cakey brownie so we drop your eggs into the chocolate one egg at a time make sure it's nicely combined before you add the next this is one of my favorite brownie recipes not only because I like fudgy brownies but also because you make this in One Bowl and that's it you don't need a stand mixer for this recipe it's really easy and light on the mess so there's the third egg so now for extra chocolate flavor a quarter of a cup of unsweetened cocoa powder and Dutch process cocoa powder is really great here because it gives you that wonderful chocolatey flavor in a really dark dark color natural cocoa powders give you more of a red chocolatey color in your brownie so a little bit of salt here to bring out the flavor and now I'm gonna switch to a rubber scraper here and I'm going to fold in the last ingredient and that is the flour so for a fudgy brownie I'm using less flour so that's 1/2 a cup plus 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour but if you wanted cakey brownies you would use almost three times as much flour so that's one and a half cups of flour so gently fold this in make sure that you scrape down the sides here because you want to make sure that you don't have any flour pockets or streaking in your batter and this now would be the point where you can add in mixin so if you want walnuts if you want pecans if you wanted some chocolate chunks you can add that at this point as well but I'm just gonna do straight-up brownies today I have an 8 by 8 inch square cake pan here and I've done my little trick which I love is lining with parchment buttering in between so that the parchment six-two itself and this makes it easy to pop the brownie right out of the pan so make sure your oven is preheated to 350 degrees and for the fudgy brownie that I'm making today it takes about 35 to 40 minutes but if you were making the cakey version it only takes about 30 minutes so set your timer our brownies are baked make sure that you cool them before cutting them and now that you should be able to lift in one piece and now for cutting a little bit of hot water make sure you wipe off the hot water and this brownie recipe gets cut into nine squares and just wipe your knife off in between cuts I like to use a very thin blade a carving knife would be really great and this crackly surface it's all dependent on how much you beat the batter after you add the eggs because you're creating some volume and that volume translate into the baked good with this paper II top so there you have it fudgy brownies or cakey brownies kitchen conundrum solved enjoy [Music] you [Music]", "20e-lent8lI": "hi guys so today we're gonna make some
