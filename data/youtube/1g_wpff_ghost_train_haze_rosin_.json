"wWeAG292V_w": "hey we're back on the frisbee of flowers again here and it looks like there's mysteriously a new item on here i think that says highly dutch rotterdam indica anyways i'm excited let's shuffle it up and have some of this whatever it picks i think it's going to pick the ghost train haze look at that i had 50 50 chance there we go ghost train hayes up 20. that's the new one here it is ghost train haze uh from up and uh this one here is a it's the new up 20 um it's sort of like it's only above 20 percent uh this new sort of line from up previously i tried the meridian from up and that was like a giant ghost train haze so hopefully this is better it's by hexo it's up hexo um yeah 212.6 milligrams or 21.26 percent that's nice and package date october the 22nd which is like that's just just over a month ago from today so very nice there's the back yeah and look at this it's a smaller bag isn't that neat normally the bags are like these gigantic things but this is actually reasonably sized so anyways first we're gonna check the scale make sure it's properly calibrated because uh i'll make sure it's accurate right so here's a 50.00 gram weight and put that on here like this boop it looks like uh we're good so here we go so we can use this little container here that should be fine for this the old reset there the tear all right it's up time ghost train haze up 20. and i'm so happy there's a new ghost train hazel on ocs because like i say this all the time but ghost train haze is one of my favorites or possibly the favorite because of the flavors so awesome and it's usually really good a really good high too so let's see here we go oh nice buds hmm there's that smell [Music] yes there's that nice smell i like so much that looks good this actually looks a little bit more like the um it looks like the ghost train haze from fucking aurora not the stuff from color which is a nice super tight stuff this stuff's very fluffy but anyways let's check the weight come on up oh that's great that's great that's a good sign good stuff up [Laughter] very nice here's all the uh 3.5 all these buds this is not really anything else so actually that looks pretty nice there now this bud it does have some tightness to it it looks fluffy right but it's tight this one's a little bit tight too oh man this one too they look so fluffy but it's pretty tight but it's nowhere near as tight as that color stuff the color ghost train haze is like super tight buds some nice sparkles in there though let's check it out with a microscope all right we're having a little look at the up ghost train haze up 20 here uh so many of these oh here we go i was gonna say look at this it's like it's been uh clear-cut there's no trichomes but then you go over here and here they are they're all hanging out over here that's nice i fucking love ghost train haze so much the flavor is so unusual and good here's a look on the side of one of these buds on one of the flat sections because there's flat sections like look this one looks kind of weird look at that there's some nice trichomes on the right and on this section here they're all gone they've all left oh there's a couple little mini ones on there those are weird looking all right whatever yeah this stuff looks okay it sure has a lot of clear trichomes and sort of um cloudy but not really any with the color change no real amber or anything a lot of sort of just cloudy like light white cloudy and clear so you know what it's time i think to break open one of these buds and look on the inside look at the uh not the best trim job on there huh look at that but anyways let's check it inside of this thing here's a look inside the buds we're checking out the inside of this up 20 ghost train haze it's got a lot of clear crystals on the inside clear trichomes rather i guess we used to always call these things crystals back in the day even though you can they're not very christian chris crystal like there's more like a ball but they sure sparkle don't they anyway so this stuff looks really nice it's a little close up on some more of them there look at these little guys in the bottom this sort of free-floating little balls of uh little trichome balls anyway so you know what this stuff looks okay it smells okay i'm gonna go try it it's got the look that kind of reminds me a bit of the aurora stuff so i'm kind of a little nervous on that because that stuff goes very fast because it's just so uh weak although this stuff is higher powered than that i think and uh hopefully it's better so i'm gonna go try it and i'll be right back all right so i just got in from this up ghost train haze up 20 at uh 21.26 or 212.6 milligrams and this stuff is pretty good i don't know if i would say that it's it's definitely not better than the color ghost train haze but it's good uh it's got a nice flavor it's got that real nice ghost train haze flavor that i love so much it's so awesome that flavor so ghost train haze is a really unique flavor i think but if you've never tried it it's um i guess you could say it's like it's like you have a skunk right and then you give this skunk some diesel fuel to drink and then the skunk goes outside and it takes a piss on like a compost pit made entirely out of citrus fruit it's it's really good i love it it's so good that's how i would describe it but i don't know the taste is nice and it doesn't last that long though on this one i would say this is more more closer to the aurora ghost train haze than the color ghost train haze and the color ghost train haze is still king it's still the best of the best and this this is closer to the aurora one i think the high on this is a little nicer it's like a medium high kind of a thing it's a little nicer like a head high not too crazy there's always a bit of a couch lock to the ghost train haze it's kind of strange like that but there's a bit of that to it but it's a really nice head high and it's like a medium high i think the high is a little better on this than the aurora but i think the aurora has better flavor because i remember well not better flavor but longer lasting flavor because the flavor on the aurora one lasted for the whole bowl right and this one here was gone after maybe about the halfway point or so but it's good like all these ghost train hazes are good so i'm not saying any of them are bad i just like certain ones more than others that's all so i would rank this you know this and aurora's ghost train haze are kind of like tied for second place they're about the same price too this one was 29.96 for 3.5 they're okay they're both okay this one here though will go up to a higher percent they have it listed at 20 to 27 so if this ever gets up in that high regions i bet this stuff would be pretty nuts and i would definitely want to try it again at that high regions but if i'm looking for a ghost train haze and i don't see this in the top end i'll probably go for the color still just because i think it's the best one but that's good stuff i like it it's this is also good i like it very nice anyway so um there's one more thing on that uh on the frisbee of flowers surprisingly so i guess we'll open that up next time there's 28 grams in there i'm excited anyways um yeah hit the subscribe button and click on the notification bell if you want it'll send you a little message when the next video goes up and then that's it for now so we'll see you later have a good one everybody", "BSruC2TJn2s": "[Music] hello welcome back to the cannabis Somali I'm your host Andrew Friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of cannabis reviews today we've got cannabis from weed MD and this is the ghost train haze this is from the medicinal side of their cannabis but I was explained that they sell their medicinal cannabis and their recreational cannabis as the same cannabis so as far as that makes sense I got this on the medicinal side there are no prescription labels on anymore and the cannabis apparently also goes to the recreational side weed envy weed MD is a science-based LP so they told me and I saw some good things from them before so I'm excited to open this show you and then I think I'm gonna do a craft beer pairing with it after let's check it out break this good old Duty seal now this has sat I have had this at home for one month so that is a little bit on me packed on November first sealed and these seals I'm never that good at getting along I'm just gonna dig into it for you guys yeah there we go and look the cannabis looks nice you know medicinal cannabis I'm never that surprised by it being pretty good like there there's some big knocks in here smells good smells like lime and lemon Pez a little bit of cat pee maybe nagas looks good looks like some like some tasty but take some videos of it and put it up in the corner here in a sec but I'll get some better videos and there's you know there's not that much shake I'm very impressed with this big nug looks good I'm gonna turn on the scale as I keep talking about it and this is a 5 gram package so I'm happy to see that I did get some big nugs it is quite dry there's no moisture retention packages in there but it still has some fluff to it and it's not it's definitely not too old to be smoked this is definitely nothing to turn your nose up at all right any means let's just put it on the scale quickly that one nug was one and a half grams so that's a nice snug to see I keep saying in all the other reviews I would like to have a 1 gram nug for my 1 gram container 4.4 there is there a 1/2 gram of shaking this maybe we'll try and get it all on there sorry for the delay 4.8 I bet there's another point 1 in here so it's it's pretty dang close 4.9 we'll call it for sure ok let's load this up and see how it tastes cuz that's kind of the most important part isn't it and this nug is just beautiful can't wait to take more pictures of it looks great so ghost train Hays is ghost OG and Neville's reck bred by rare dankness seeds originally like this looks really good like these are caked and coated knobs that are nice and dance like yeah definitely nothing to turn your nose up at this you know so far so good to be super honest with you like wood smoke this is this is what you could should expect from medicinal canvas to be honest like it looks looks good about two strikes on my fingers now from finger bust like it's uh it's passed an old test so far have some smell to it tonight that lemon lemon PES kind of ask notes that I mentioned and where is the other piece of the volcano or won't work where have you gone there she blows alright so the trusty volcano said it six and a half as always let's see the vapor production it look like good canvas once again I'm just gonna keep saying that over and over again just from looks that about OneNote yeah you know in the in the five grand package look nice and let's have a little taste and see how it is I could also hit it in my packs to try that out hmm tastes like it smells always a good sign lemon Pez lemon cream lime quite dribble say to see how it burns but I have seen that the burns pretty good ghost train haze weed MD you know stepping it up want definitely so far the best canvas review I've had great nug good taste still some still quite a bit of smell so for the appearance that looks that looks great that's completely up there if it wasn't you know most the nubs are pretty big I'm gonna give it a solid 18 points that's probably the highest I've ever given cannabis like this it looks really nice trim looks good caked in trichomes nice and dense nice snug on the nose smells good but doesn't smell absolutely amazing what would I give it probably 35 points for taste it tasted like it smelled and it tasted might even have tasted a little bit better for the taste I wouldn't mind giving it at all another 18 points 17 points and my overall impression well this was pretty good canvas and if you would receive this on the recreational market I'd definitely be very very happy so again I'm gonna say 18 points and we'll see what that is is it a 90 point cannabis is it just under I can't do the math quick enough in my head thank you so much for watching I hope you make sure to LIKE comment share and subscribe if you can get some ghost train haze from

about it in my songs I brought it to the artists to athletes to the elite smokers and you know influences in the world I was repping biscotti so hard I almost named and Scott Storch is my witness the big pescado biscotti like literally almost named to my album biscotti and I rapped about it in so many songs and trust me I really campaigned hard Frodo's and on transe is this without getting into too much detail this doesn't even matter I'm in a good point in my life if I put in all that work and all that effort to hand select to name to blow this [ __ ] up globally everybody knows about biscotti because of me and I'm not no longer participating in that and I can't grow myself and I have it and I can't use the names for anything then why would I [ __ ] with it why would I smoke it and

that's the new work so the same way we ran it up you don't run it up again cookies now one more thing purple punch look no disrespect to the breeders a purple punch to the growers of purple punch what's going on in California right now is a bunch of people are growing it they're packaging it on the REC market and then renaming it a hundred different things and after buying 15 different styles

purple punch no disrespect to you but do we get got somebody I see Packers up 30 different ways mm-hmm keep it", "1PwwKxUL0AA": "all right welcome back everybody purpose of this video is to try to teach people how to determine female seeds for male seeds okay if you have feminized seeds they're female don't even try this okay so this is this what I learned a long long time ago I wouldn't say it's exactly 100% because it's up to you know your own discretion so there's a lot of human interference in there but it's about 90 95 percent accurate if you actually are really like really a you know quality controlled about I was gonna say anal whatever but you know if you're really anal about it and you really really really only go for strict strict looks then you can pull it off 100% okay but this is what I come up with okay the female seeds look look a lot like this okay and if you see these seeds here see how they have like a little top to them okay now if you were look to look on this top you'll see a perfect circle where's my camera okay you'll see perfect circles it kind of looks like a little volcano maybe something like that oh look what I just found out guys so my cameras over here but when I put things over here it gets blurry when I put things over here they become clear oh you look nice I can work see how blurry though we did just remember that when you guys are trying to show stuff you put it right in front of you camera is blurry if you put it over there look how clear so so that's a perfect circle in there and it's like the volcano shape okay so you want to look for on the top of the seeds you want it to have like a little Ridge it doesn't have to be that defined these are pictures so you completely understand what I'm talking about okay they're a little over exaggerated so you're gonna see a little bit of a climb with in the middle will be a perfect circle okay and that's where actually the seed attaches to the actual button okay so you can see the top of the seeds it's the round piece and then you'll have you know the the sides of the little volcano that you'll be able to see from the top it'll look like you know you know it look like puckering up and then you have a complete perfect circle in the center and then from the side you see will look something like this okay the male seeds have a smaller Ridge or no Ridge at all okay do not confuse male seeds with immature seeds okay these are immature seeds they're super flat on the top but you can tell they have not grown yet okay those are immature seeds okay they have not completely formed do not confuse this with a male seed okay now mind you this probably would have formed into a male seed although it is not fully matured yet but this is how a male seed will look see how it has a kind of slight bump to it okay let's go to a male seed okay see how it's got slightly kind of inclined raised okay see it but it's flat it is flat it looks like a but okay and there is a circle in there but the circle will not be perfect it will not be centered perfectly normally and it will be flat looking and look kind of like you know it'll be like that you have a circle and there will be a weird thing around it and they look like little bloodshot lines spitting out of it and they'll look like these seats here these are 100% sure for sure mail seeds okay no doubt in my mind so this is just the easy way and I went through a whole bunch of different seeds to find males from females but um it's just an easy way if you're going through stuff like this and you want to find female and male seeds okay yeah yeah yeah that's a lot of seeds I got a couple of these okay I'm sure all you do to these right here people these are all skunk baby all skunk you see there's some immature ones in there blah blah blah whatever but yeah that's what these are so I hope this helps you guys you can determine your seeds a lot faster before you ever stick them in the dirt okay so try this technique out you know give me feedback see if it works for you works for me I know mother nature it also does this way works for her that's how we do it you know and like I said it's all up to human discretion you know you might look at you might look at a seed and say on all about by what he was saying that that might be a male but that's a female female seed perfectly round circle with the but you know the volcano look to it okay male seed are me female seed pardon me okay that's how we do it see that male seed see that you can see the volcano to it but look how flat it is okay male seed so I hope this guys this helps you guys I just thought I'd make this real quick while I was doing the harvest I forgot I had told somebody I was gonna make this for them so hopefully they watch this and you know pick up a future a few tricks are just bit my tongue so now I'm gonna get back to harvesting people so have a good evening", "Nmb_ZLRo8M0": "[Music] welcome back to terpy eyes my name is ryan and today we're going to be pressing 14 grams of ice water hash using products from the press club my press setup is pretty basic and a few years old it is a 10 ton hydraulic shock press that can be purchased at any of your local hardware stores as for the heated pressing plates they are from a company called clean extractions that are no longer in business similar sets can be found on the market by searching rods and pressing plates although there are much better designs on the market nowadays [Music] let's get started with the rosin pressing process the material you're pressing is ice water hash that was made from an outdoor grow i did previously so over time the hash definitely has gotten darker over time it is a blend of barbara bud harley quinn bx4 and green crack that was harvested fresh and put straight into the freezer before making the ice water hash we'll be pressing 14 grams in a single 2x4 pressing bag this is a little bit too much material for this size bag which we'll see when we go to press it later on since we are pressing hash we can use anywhere between a 15 micron and 37 micron for the bags i chose 15 for this press along with a 25 micron bag for the outer bag always double bag when pressing hash as it not only prevents blowouts but it also keeps the inner bag closed since hash tends to expand when heated [Music] we are using the directional flow method which directs all the rosin out the front of the plates i folded the parchment paper a little too tight for the size pressing bag which resulted in the parchment paper ripping open during the pressing process which cut the first press short [Music] as you can see we had issue with a pressing bag getting squeezed at the front of the plates don't get this confused with a blowout all that happened was the plates were not lined up properly so when the hash got heat into it the rosin made it slick enough that the entire bag got pushed out the front of the plates from the pressure so all i did was reset everything and double checked everything was lined up and level we have our plates heated to 70 degrees celsius and our first press is about two minutes in duration before i noticed the rosin was coming out the one side [Music] as you can see when pulling everything out the rosin was getting squeezed at the left side this is because there was too much pressure on the parchment paper from being folded a bit too tight against the pressing bag not too big of a deal this just means our second press will be a much bigger yield than normal for the second press i like to fold the bag in half and use the directional flow method again usually i don't use the directional flow method on the second press because normally we get most of the yield out on the first press [Music] if you're new to the channel i upload videos every week covering indoor and outdoor grows solventless extractions products and equipment so if that's what you're into be sure to hit that subscribe button and turn on the bell notifications so you don't miss out when new content is posted being a cannabis channel we are unable to monetize most of our videos so if you want to show a little extra support we offer channel memberships on youtube which gives you early access to every video before it goes public and exclusive discount codes a big thank you to the channel members who have already shown support and signed up for the channel memberships [Music] now it's time to collect our beautiful [Music] rosin since we have several pieces of parchment paper covered in rosin the large glass stamp makes quick work of it we make sure to save the ross and pressing bag as there's still a good amount of thc remaining on the edges of the bag [Music] you can see here that the parchment paper ripped open during the first press while collecting the rosin off this piece we'll be extra gentle to make sure not to get any loose paper into our rows and ball don't forget if you're enjoying this video so far to hit that like button it really goes a long way in supporting the channel and helping us grow [Music] with the rosin fully collected now you can really get a good look at the quality that came from this process while collecting the rosin it had a slight shattery consistency to it while still remaining soft for short-term storage or to get a true look at the color we can use the fep sheets these sheets are terpene-proof and can be heat sealed they are also non-stick so getting the rosin off of them is very easy putting our collected raws and bulb between two sheets and then placing them between the heated plates which have been turned off for a while but still remain warm allows for the rosin ball to be squished into a nice even circle allowing us to enjoy the color and texture [Music] as you can see we're able to extract 10 grams of the live rosin out of the ice water hash giving us a 75 yield for this process thanks for making it to the end of the video and until next time happy growing [Music] everyone you", "7vVBz2I_1k8": "all right hi guys jcat from FC here we're gonna try out the supreme of a prototype number for [Music] electric conversion kit again I actually built another set of plates tonight apart from prototype number four - so this is pretty much exactly like the last one nice clean cuts as you can see it's coming along well although well building it the first plate I snapped off the tap so yeah I should have taken my time a little bit more I guess there and we replaced at that tap in my plate luckily I had a spare anyway enough babbling hmm those trained haze actually we're gonna have some broken post super Lemon Haze this is a bit of an older batch thing not buying anything from the current batch just because they're quite low THC worse this one's a little bit higher really nice-looking well only about 16% THC but super nice flavor all these more recent batches are down around 12 13 percent so that's too low for my liking so I haven't bought any for a while that's my last drop [Music] so with full buds in the stem the pits set up 185 right now and it's sitting at 180 8.8 on the spring bait 3 the longer when I put this in there though that's gonna draw up quite a bit usually drop about 10 degrees and then stays at that temperature throughout the head listen to some deaden company here I'm a big Grateful Dead fan and I do like the new flavor with John Mayer I'm a huge Bob Weir fan though so not just Jerry Garcia in the younger generation joining them these days are actually doing pretty bang-up anyway enough dead head ramblings let's get going with this yeah this time I'm gonna remember to let it heat soak for a little bit so that's what that sit there for maybe 20 seconds or something [Music] flavored carbonated beverages almost club soda no sugar tea good stuff [Music] probably eat soaked too long so as I said it drops announcing around 180 nice to stay there so here goes [Music] [Music] [Music] not bad for something that's only 16 percent THC thing is I think I'm going to need a little bit more before I go to bed so let's turn this up to 200 lumen Celsius by the way [Music] the final prototype runs about 15 degrees cooler than the second prototype I think that's just a little bit less mass on the plates and slightly larger opening on the top and bottom effects that you can see see it's open on the top and on the bottom that makes the machining of it a lot easier and makes it much more flexible for coil size in as well so yeah I have my pit set with a delta of minus 60 and then 185 balanced at 185 I've got it set at minus 75 now and I think it shows maybe a couple degrees hotter so it's maybe not quite 15 difference but anyway I think my supreme babe three battery's dying but anyway you can see it's about around 200 there so what we're gonna do is we're gonna grab a little bit of rosin ooh that's almost going but luckily and a couple more containers [Music] hard to see that England is for you anyway it's actually a pretty sizable tab attack [Music] I really need to pick up some hemp fiber I think I'd enjoy it quite a bit more than cotton swabs but you know being remote where I am to order it will cost me about 15 bucks to get it shipped here so it's not so much the cost of the hemp fiber it's getting it shipped here so I have to wait to bundle it with another order or something now I'm really badly not [Music] all right look at that pits at 200 and the supreme bakery is a 200 so actually in the 170 to 200 range with it with it having a delta of minus 75 this thing actually is pretty close reflection before we hit that we need to let it back in a little bit yeah it's probably kid [Music] Oh hot damn I think I got that hold a butt in one on that I can feel that

we're showing signal strength here for the stream decent it didn't show that before so now that's pretty good to see anyways let me go ahead and share the link out to instagram and we're going to go ahead and get started uh all right cool well glad we got that up and running let me go ahead and uh get this stream up on my computer oh you're right let's see i'm sure you guys want to see some of this stuff that i have here before we even get started right let me show you what we got going on first of all we weighed everything out earlier we uh pulled it out of the freeze dryer fresh this morning fat fat nineteen point four percent yield killed it one thousand one hundred and thirty grams of nug went in 220 grams of full spectrum hash came out as well as 19 grams of 25 and 160 micron so this is our test press that we use for edibles and then we'll go ahead and press out the rest of these full spectrum pucks i loaded them by hand into the bags and then after putting them in the bags i pressed them down in a rosin evolution pre-press to make sure that they stayed nice and tight and they are evenly distributed went up from uh the small little four ounce jars and uh upgraded to the six ounce jars i got tired of filling those little small ones to the brim and i said it's time to upgrade baby so we got the jar all weighed out we'll be able to weigh this when we're done tonight and see what our final yield was on this run now i'm a big fan of doing my presses a little bit warmer than what most people would i'm using my stool for you guys today so i'm gonna do this but um yeah you guys that watch me often know i will press anywhere from 200 to 225 depending on the cultivar depending on the hash um not all hash comes out the same um for example we talked about trichome density before right we talked about just because it looks like a lot of hash it may not be a lot of hash because um the oil inside may not be full you know what i'm saying the trichome may just be partially full in that case it's fluffy hash where it looks like a lot but it doesn't weigh a lot that's why this 25 micron and this 160 micron it looks like a large puck but it only weighs 19 grams compared to this puck which is smaller in comparison by about a centimeter right and it's not as fat but it weighs more probably about five to six grams more and that's because this is the full spectrum 45 through the 159 which contains higher density trichomes that are full of milk oil compared to the 25 and 160. so just a little throw that in there for you interior genetics what's going on asteroid farms if you guys aren't following asteroid farms on instagram go follow so old homie of mine platinum grove colorado who used to have a really pimp-ass girl room the nasa lab right um one of the inspirations for me initially stepping up my garden well now it's his turn to come back and he just got a brand new house with a nice ass basement and guess what it's time for a brand new build out so we're gonna help each other out take some ideas off of each other and i'm basically gonna have him record the whole thing and um show you guys how he does his build out you know and he'll give you guys pointers along the way and uh you know show you how to build a grow room so by the time you know he's done with that uh build out i'll be done uploading my video on how when i built out my grow room and uh his will be pretty much part two of a series that i'm going to be doing where it's going to be either build-outs brand new or remodels or upgrades and you guys will be able to pay for each episode um individually and absorb all the information that went into that whole build or remodel so it was actually his idea and we're gonna do his build out as episode two so it's gonna be awesome it's gonna have amazing information in there and it's gonna be great for you guys because instead of just seeing my room all the time and you're like oh that's great but not everybody has your room like yours or not everybody has a layout like yours you'll get to see different layouts different places different um climates right you're gonna get to see it all and you're gonna get to see the different thought process that goes into building these so it's gonna be really cool but anyways go check out his instagram because he's already started posting updates on it and it's not often that you get to jump on board and watch it build out brand new from the start most of the time you hop in and it's like uh the person's halfway done they've already done a bunch of [ __ ] you kind of like feel like the new guy you know what i'm saying in a crowd of old guys that been around for a long time now's your chance to get in on the bottom floor be one of those old guys he's been there forever by the time he gets done finishing you could be like i was there when you were still drawing the blueprints yo whippersnapper some of this blue icy and then i'm going to glove up the press is set to 175. we're going to do a low temp press on our test bag it's not going to be a clear indication of how the full spectrum is going to respond but it's going to give me a good enough idea to know whether or not 175 is going to provide the flow i'm looking for or if i'm going to need to go up to my 204 temperature 202 maybe i will put a link up right now i'm not sure that you guys can do it that's what's up jinder mah what's up dude i haven't seen you in forever holy moly so yeah check out asteroid farms what's going on viper what's up slug upstate what's going on we're just giving everybody a minute to trickle on in taking dabs we're enjoying life i haven't even taken a dab with you guys yet have i ah let's take a dab i'm gonna go in on some of this blue icy first oh let's get in there who wants to get in those guts with me we've got 31 left on this battery oh let's get in there the gopro doesn't focus well close up so you guys are gonna take what you get and be happy all right first time catching a live stream viper you caught a very good live stream for your first live stream this whole live stream i've already prepped all my parchment i prepped all my bags normally i'm not this prepped normally i still have full parchment and [ __ ] i wiped down the plates i'm ready to go baby it's waiting on you guys i mean what do you think we're about to press a half pound of hash a half pound cheers at 413 on the email okay ah that blue icy i swear on the exhale it tastes just like a blue icy it is so crazy every time it never fails what's up easy labs green ranger nashville how you doing freshly pressed what's up annie oh gee what's up hidden creek we got the whole [ __ ] family here i think i'm gonna do a live stream prank and start a live stream pressing hash with the hair straightener so we can get a million people asking oh no what happened did the press break fantastic so huh all righty all righty all righty let's swap out the battery you already know we got it we gotta swap out the battery we don't want it to die it'll be another short live stream i had to find it i couldn't forget i couldn't remember where the [ __ ] i put it down now i can't remember which batteries are charged now let's see lucky number nothing they'd be lying sometimes you got to pull them out and pop them back in they're not lying tonight [ __ ] [ __ ] well one of you's got to be higher than 25 [ __ ] percent let's find out i i don't feel comfortable knowing i've got 25 percent left on the battery i just took a fat ass dab and i'm about to start pressing i'm gonna get excited forget and this is gonna die by the way if the stream does go down unexpectedly please stay tuned because i will bring it right back up this is a non-stop party tonight that battery was at 100 you [ __ ] lying ass charger all right all right so for those of you that are new here i do a [ __ ] ton in a very small space so this is where i'm going to be collecting at when i'm all done here okay we're gonna move some [ __ ] out of the way shout out to roz and inc i want you guys to look at something real close here custom product for who that is who has bags like that who has bags like that do you want to know why he carries these two and a half by four and a half bags hey cuz of me baby who wants some bags i know some of you press and some of you need some bags all right anyways we've got parchment laid out we've got our bags ready to go okay and here you guys are going to go you're going to go right here look at that just for you how's that view yeah you could just chill set you down now is a good time if you got to use the restroom you got to go grab a drink you know what i'm saying whatever you got to do go handle that let me figure out this lighting i don't want it to be too bright for you guys oh [ __ ] that's too bright all right i feel good about this you guys are ordering from rosin inc make sure you guys use my coupon codes they're on my site solventlessbnb.com let's get ready get up there get up there just a little love from my homie right there you know all right remember you guys we're gonna be doing the 160 micron and the 25 micron mixed together as a test press before we move on to the full spectrum presses here we have the uh [ __ ] puck come on turn on screen doesn't recognize my gloves oh well anyways i hope that you guys were able to see that now this uh this is just some uh edibles mix of some uh the last strain that i pressed out which is the grape cosby little dark but it is [ __ ] chirpy and delicious and it will do amazing for edibles because the flavor that it will add is not too over the top but it's definitely like you notice it notice it so we're going to drip this into that edibles jar this is probably not going to flow crazy this is a test press a low temp test press at 175 all right i honestly feel like i should go up a little so so so so oh that looks like it's gonna be good well i think i found the temperature i'm gonna try for the first full spectrum maybe it'll flow a little bit more i'll take it for edibles siezer um don't worry that was just a plate on top of the press jumping around my cold plate up there good extraction well the flow was okay wasn't quite what i want it's kind of a weird flow so all right well not quite what i'm looking for believe it or not 185 that's gonna give me that awkward drip i'm gonna hold pull my audience to see what you guys think the temperature is that i'm gonna go with i already know what i'm going with i'm gonna go with uh my usual all right well we're gonna go ahead and do the first full uh spec press now all the same size that one was at 175. small bag we'll do this one first oh jesus 224 no too high 202 202 202 that's that's where i'm feeling 202 today i can feel it in my huevos rancheros pressing some cool spectrum once cash baby all right the room temperature is 74 degrees i do not believe in running a cold room during the pressing stage now bear with me you guys this is going to be a tad bit awkward as i have to deal with not only the um press this new jar which is larger and doesn't sit on the edge so i have to hold it like this in fact i don't even know what your viewpoint is now does that make sense right there where it's at for you guys i mean all right here we go we're at 191.1 191.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 six that's how slow my press heats up i love it i don't care what anybody says it doesn't overshoot temperatures during pressing because it sleeps it heats up slowly it doesn't like jump up all crazy because it has some overpowered 150 to 200 watt heaters it just has two 100 watt heaters nicely spaced out let's take a dab again next time tomorrow it sounds delicious this [ __ ] is like caramel taffy uh oh uh oh ah excuse me i felt like my nose was gonna run all over camera i didn't want that oh yeah what's up mommy my [ __ ] that'll do good that'll do oh that gets the job done i'll tell you what how you guys feeling about this prize we're at 199.7 199.7.8.9 200. 201 i'm not there and dad just [ __ ] knock me on my ass about let's get ready to remove look at that still plenty of paper towel left to clean bangers with throw that away save that puffing my man it's a good night when my boy puffin comes to visit you're pressing yourself right now huh hell yeah get it dog we are warmed up to 202 degrees let's go this is gonna be a second test press slightly lower than my normal but for some reason i'm feeling this temperature why i saw gonza say 204 and i'm like yeah yeah that's my normal i feel it but then all of a sudden my balls rumbled and spoke to me from deep within and they said no 202 now they're all right [ __ ] it the balls haven't lied yet oh what would you look at that there already me gusta come here come to daddy a little [ __ ] go what i say i knew it i felt it i felt it in my huevos rancheros oh yeah let's get messy somebody's got to make a meme out of the next big bag that squirts all over this jar so i'm feeling good about that that's a fish grab that and we're gonna move this over here i'll turn you right now 202 my [ __ ] i want to know did i get it all did

let's see what am i checking your story i don't know maybe i jumped in at the wrong part of that conversation oh elevated uh nah there wasn't a lot on the parchment there was barely anything in here really maybe like two to three grams that was a small piece of uh that was small and that was 19 grams in there and uh [ __ ] dude not a lot left in there it's all over the [ __ ] sides of this jar is where it's at you guys want to see a big squirt huh all right let's get it gotta get off this cyber dream stuff though um all right let's get it big old fatty this one feels like a 27-30-ish somewhere in there all right let's go i don't want to listen to trap sorry i gotta get i gotta get the right music on first this is bothering me put on some good old tj hotto all right let's go i'm gonna fold this one down the center i just pinch it crease it down the center diagonal the other diagonals and that gives you kind of like a good flow right there already and then you just pinch the sides together and it's like let me check my battery here 85 percent go dude i'm all smoking one squeeze okay shout out to my man mysticalgo my official artist on sbnb records back down oh yep bomb extraction on that one let's go cross mountain ranges split cells of tomorrow it flowed so well there's like not even that much on the paper let us go yes uh let's keep this party [ __ ] going good over here peace i think i put some information in the description maybe i didn't add that i guess but 25 micron double bag from rosin inc for the uh for the bags my bad y'all i tried to put some information in there and i left out that one yo if you guys can't catch the live streams sign up for my patreon i upload them there so come to daddy um is i'm the master of my own fate i determine my own yield i grew the flowers this is the source of the single i am my own god excuse you uh is that's why i keep the ends of these parchment pieces wrap them over the parchment paper i wish i could slow this down listen listen did you [ __ ] catch it though my man [ __ ] threw it in putting him on game yo understand he let y'all know i'm putting y'all on game for free i'm gonna i'm gonna take it back one time is it too loud uh um let's go ladies and gentlemen it's time to flow i'm gonna bring you guys back some i feel like i'm not bad hold on you guys don't really need that flashlight i don't think anyways let me take it off and passed wrench squad hold it down here's a pro tip on really fat pucks make sure you leave a little extra space behind the puck so that you don't get a blowout but i can mute it that's fine didn't need that light but i'm not liking how that's lining up on the [ __ ] plates i'm gonna move it over just a tad real quick like uh is i go go go go go real big extraction what is it [ __ ] this one's really done i'm calling it now it's gonna be a dumper is nobody [ __ ] with you you know what as a kid i actually did like origami and [ __ ] you know what was better than origami paper [ __ ] planes god damn it paper planes with a [ __ ] i could fold all types of paper planes you guys when i was a kid not now you know why i can't do it now because i lost the book i didn't look that [ __ ] up read that [ __ ] in the book you know what i mean books are cool as [ __ ] you can learn how to make paper airplanes and [ __ ] who would have thought mm-hmm starting to get good at this [ __ ] so um okay well brown is foreign i until you quit this next one's gonna squirt like a [ __ ] so um okay i have that camera ready i'm gonna record this one on my phone i'm not sure how i'ma do it watch me money money all the time hey money please no worries it's only 200 degrees touch it with your [ __ ] hands that sense sorry i'm trying to align this a little bit differently here safety reasons there it is my press has a ram that can adjust positions so um it's a little bit different than most the ram isn't stationary which means that it can come out of alignment sometimes if i move it or whatever but it's all we're helping to make good taking care of your summer projects is a breeze bam summer savings on all your favorite brands make things even easier so freshen up the deck and fire up the grill summer's here and it's as close as your home yard get more done let's get it i've used this prosper [ __ ] ever you're biking like five years now i just let go of the [ __ ] bar my bad you guys the camera is on a very unsteady amount kinda i don't have the tripod leg spread out very well all right is to the place whoa the puck slit in the plates when i was adjusting it apparently almost popped out of the front no blow out though but i gotta pull it out real quick and readjust it i'm so glad that didn't blow out but somehow that slipped out that's a trip i'm so happy that i didn't blow out that's crazy what the [ __ ] i've never had that happened that's a trip that's a trip son experience saved for real he wouldn't would he he [ __ ] would let's go back on the plates you go you son of a [ __ ] that was a trippy trip trippy trip trip this thing is about i was like why is it not going like it should be leaking way more and then all of a sudden the handle slipped and i was like what the [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] what happened put that back on the plate for a second up a let that so hmm who's your daddy who's your daddy what a safe uh is before oh yeah good extraction i'll take it oh yeah let's power through it two more to go parchment gets added to the jar everything i want everything together mixed together equal even steven the stuff that sticks to the parchment might be different terpenes might be different different [ __ ] you know you don't want to leave it out shop from the comfort of your home at sprint.com that's not a lot of work bro i know i'm saying it's already time to upgrade the jar again i just got this damn jar i'm upset it's not fun i thought for sure it was going to be good enough we knew get a bigger drawer uh bertha it's time to go squirtle what the [ __ ] it did it again something's going on here is it sliding something's happening here there's no blowout but it's sliding off pressure's not being applied evenly to the plates somehow or they're too tight or i pre-packed them at an angle never had this happen okay i know what i'm about to do fix this i'm going to have to increase the pressure even slower every problem there is a solution hmm leaned on him to apply pressure for the pre-press by doing it evenly i had to have been time to upgrade and put my bigger plates on i guess for these bigger presses right inside there i hope you guys are watching this if you guys aren't [ __ ] paying attention i don't know what you're doing right now when i mess up that's when you guys need to pay attention because i don't mess up very often not to sound cocky whatsoever but i don't so if i make a mistake that's resulting in some type of mess up it would benefit everybody around me to pay attention and realize what i'm doing wrong so i got my light that's fine before i make sure i got the jar underneath there i didn't think it was going to squirt like that still this parchment is heavy from the [ __ ] first part of the press but it's still flowing good that's all that matters and no blowout fan dumb strong on the top setting don't you get a damn hum my curl is my rocker maybe i choose you and i don't even have i don't even have um i have a couple theories for what it is lots of adjusts right now it's increasing pressure too fast and also i have the press at a a pretty good angle right now leaning towards the front and i think that the hash is melting and making the puck inside uneven and then it blows out the front like that so i think i'm just going to go ahead oops just hit the table i'm going to go ahead and flatten out the press a little bit more risky with this puck anymore how would i do on the save [ __ ] crazy giving her incredible so okay my battery at 34 okay um check the alignment of the plates one more me come on gloves don't stupid i know it's not that cold in here but then mm-hmm little 74 degrees in here oh missiles contemplating life changes foreign foreign let me grab some parchment hold on i got an idea not so much as an idea that i just want to do something for this press just insurance actually all okay searching for savings on descriptions is so complex it's like getting a documentary unfortunately you just savings period not all patients eligible savings so um me yes i haven't even hit one ton of pressure you guys think i'm kidding look so just hit two and a half oh figured it out right pressure was increasing too fast and the angle probably didn't know so so well aren't you guys glad i got the internet connections really good attraction well wow please so um batteries are charged let's get a battery swap in before we do anything else we'll go from there sound good oh think so okay all right so good job bertha good job baby we're gonna take a dab and then after this dab i'm going to um go ahead and collect what's on the parchment and get it added to the jar while it's still warm man that's heavy that's heavy i mean yield wise i'm thinking it's got to be it's got to be upwards of 80 it has to be you know there's it is no [ __ ] way it's not it's a little harsh didn't it that's okay i'll turn it down i knew there was a little [ __ ] nap thingy in here a little [ __ ] flew right on me else we know there's never a good time to run out of fresh luckily our delivery and free pickup excuse me so whether it's a few extra guns from the back all right i mean you can't help it i got lights on in here when i come in through the garage little [ __ ] just came in with me i guess oh boy oh what

strain gives you these nice solid den snugs when you do it right really benefit from scrog I didn't get too many of these because I was growing it with a whole bunch of other strains in an experimental affair but you definitely could have pulled more nugs like this if you do it in the screen again this is about 10 weeks strain 10 weeks for a nice strong sativa high that gets you right in the head with that warm fuzzy uplifting feeling it's a fair trade really ten weeks is nothing for that get these nice frosty buds you can see really really nice frosted buds mmm turn it nice and slow for you for ten weeks I was really happy with the outcome part of my animals in the bag for ten weeks I was really happy with the outcome I got a solid yield I loved sat Eva's I just hate anything past ten weeks so my groom it throws off the rest of my stuff so if you're looking to throw a sativa in your screen this is where it's at man it's got that nice OG funky taste the lemon fuelie taste on the exhale a little bit of haze in there a little softness from that again really a good strain if you're into that stuff you're looking for a nice set eva definitely recommend this over any of the other shorter flowering set team is like what is it super Lemon Haze which I've grown a bunch of this will definitely be in my collection if I didn't lose the genetic due to some crappy moves on my cloning behalf it clones very well but I just you know wasn't paying attention to my corner and that was the end of that alright guys so this is a gritty grower ghost rain haze number one definitely worth the try take care bye", "udyuvzynV-Q": "youtube what is up it's your boy here cushy and i've been freaking trying to get a playstation 5 since 12 o'clock last night been

never gonna be a spot for it but my new little chill spot here i can fit nine so if anyone ever wants to come over hit me up two people could probably sleep on us he said you can just do hold on what was that you needed to do more sativas for your videos now it's on point yeah i'm all wound up man i'm not a sativa person holy crap this thing really got me going but it's not like that weird sativa

glasses check that out i might check it out we'll see what's up my man up good you good i'm in yeah man i i love the indica and then this next one i got coming out yeah can you do a moxie where are you from uh pittsburgh like uh new canon way out that way yeah i'm about to talk with anybody i swear ask anybody who was at the canna fest with me anybody that knew me seeing me anything we were smoking it was a great time uh chill what i didn't turn the knob i was trying to but yeah man i'm always down the uh smoke but with this aroma [ __ ] going crazy now it's kind of you know it's gotten shitty again it was kind of going good now it's kind of gone back to the bat but this here uh chunky diesel i don't i can't say i didn't have this cartridge but i don't think i did and then i've turned and i'm going here yes yeah i've had that before too for sure some of them uh i don't have them but in here but uh the pharmacy rx carts uh definitely got me uh litter litter litter yeah the sativa thing on me to do is definitely ramble on but anyways back to the story for 15th time i keep forgetting chunky d's of cresco came out with their rso it was chunky diesel um i thought oh it's a hybrid it shouldn't be that how can i contact you where are you from where are you from uh and go my instagram pa underscore cushy you can always hit me up on there a lot of behind the scenes [ __ ] goes down there because i can only post so much on here i get away with more on uh instagram so pa underscore cushy there's a ton of like fakes out there so just watch but it's pa underscore cushy keep it going give it a piece of bro i don't even know how to grow i wish yeah if they legalized it i'm growing two plants i got a cheetah piss seed from cookies detroit and i have a grassroots uh pele rose um whatever the hell it was but i ate this stuff here it was like i don't even know 0.3.4 maybe a half gram of it and uh it was new video game came out what the heck was that game uh lighters on that's something that cabinet ah i forget what game it is but um i played that [ __ ] for four days straight i'm sorry for saying that word but played after four days straight couldn't get away from it i was couldn't go to sleep it was just bad like i was up for four days then i had to go to work it was like a long weekend or something uh but yeah it sucked and it was like all wearing off right on monday when you had to go back to work it was like ah but that really hadn't gone almost i didn't even go in monday to be honest with you because i was like so hung over with it this thing's phenomenal i love how it's so smooth they'll make you call what i don't know like i said i've been doing this since 2018. i only found two seeds in medical marijuana from pa you know yeah one wasn't even from pa one was i only found one pa medical seat and i was from uh the pele rouge it was grassroots and i have it uh and as soon as this becomes legal these cards hit really nice man you could feel the smoke coming into your mouth it's just it's a good job like one ooh afghani happy dope i love calypso i love their company they're nicer than nice uh answer any of your questions if you just hit them up on instagram like i said if you don't follow me pa underscore cushy pa underscore cushy on instagram but you guys rock hell yeah hit me up on instagram you guys rock uh love you subscribe oh how to grow yeah if i wish they would last girl man look he looked like me all wound up on the sativa man it's like holy [ __ ] but it's like a rural mellow really nice sativa don't give you that like weird feeling at least to me because i don't like sativas but all around great cork so glad i got this uh cresco prime or grassroots what all depends i like grassroots flower and like prime i don't know i don't like paint and then prime like their blue block or their pink boxes the pink lids are uh 65 but they're trim runs which i mean it is what it is it's nice wax the [ __ ] still looks good but like when i actually found that out i was like holy crap and i and we were up at the canopy and we were up with the cannafest talking to the uh yeah yeah that's what i mean we they need to let's grow they're not going to they're so they're against it's all wolf and [ __ ] i mean he's so against all of this like it's crazy it's not even cool anymore it's like new jersey now new jersey to get all that money all them people from philly are going to go to new jersey and buy [ __ ] just grab christmas card we're in michigan they're going to crestville carts what do you want i had the gelato from rhythm i'm i'm four as hell from milo damn they got cresco carton in the michigan i'll be going up here soon probably here it's been a while uh since i've been up there i'm probably pretty much out of my stock got one stizzy left and a little bit of this uv extracts that's about all i got but i definitely uh want to take a run up there damn i don't know how much are they what are they they graham's half grand when the next cannafest probably 420 next year if that even happens if this ronin you know what i mean it all depends on that there hasn't been that was the only that will be not cali there was a couple vegas had something but on like the east coast way this was the only uh 50 for a half g what store is it damn that's the same prices here so i kind of sucks to go up here and buy cresco stuff whenever you know man but the therapy you can get an ounce of terrain for 180 bucks at cookies that was it was a deal weekend it was like their first weekend they dropped up their whole house for a buck 80. detroit right in detroit there's a street where there's just you could stop at every disc but one after another after another and go and tear up and worth it of course that you can get like 40 dollars gee i i hate their pens or pen i i don't like if it ain't an ll or cartridge i don't like your pearl to be honest with you i'll smoke like the fuegos you know i mean stuff like afro work cartridge because these are just so expensive to just you know burn up uh but with this ronin and [ __ ] now like i don't really let anybody hit it so they're lasting way way longer yeah i bet yeah right when i was up there last like dark was yeah yeah yeah a lot when i was up there last they were bringing all that terrapin just dropped up there uh which was pretty cool and yeah i was like i got a half ounce for like under 100 bucks with the deals that were going on i paid 100 for 200 i figured it'd be cheap well then you get 25 percent off right i had like you have to wear their merch or whatever g leaf has i seen the g leaf sauce carts i almost grabbed one the other day but i just i get my license back here like super soon i'm trying to save my money out for uh a car so it's like i've been kind of chilling out on uh vids and [ __ ] but um yeah this thing uh is definitely a thumbs up what do you think about you know the ones yeah the king said yeah so uh this thing that all right yeah i'll do a blinker this thing takes long too i'm not doing it on a high though because it just i'll do it on medium it'll suck the whole cart down if", "lad7ftV3_VM": "feathering that air hole now i know why i learned to play the recorder when i was six years old it was all in preparation for owning a dynavap hello fair ladies and gentlemen today i am reviewing ghost train haze a delicious sounding strain from color cannabis this is legally bought cannabis in canada and the recreational market i'm gonna get inside have a look at what's there and uh join me let's find out is this a good strain or not so the ghost train haze it's something i've heard quite a lot about from my friends it's something that's been on my radar for a little bit been hoping to check it out and i saw it at my local cannabis store and thought you know what i'm gonna give it a go it cost me 29.99 that's before tax after tax we're looking at around 34 a little bit under and that was for an eighth so for 3.5 grams it comes in this plastic tub which i'm sure none of us are really too big a fan of these plastic tubs but that's just how it is for now um i hope to see more environmentally friendly solutions um come into the market uh there is hemp plastic um there's possibly biodegradable solutions although i know that health canada has regulations in place to make sure the producers are keeping the product fresh um but there must be better ways to do it than these plastic tubs i don't want to go in too hard on color cannabis for it because i'd say 80 of the product that you buy is in the same kind of tub so it's more of an industry problem rather than a specific licensed producer problem but i'd be remiss if i didn't say it and really hope to see more sustainable packaging in the future so on the package it's confirming 3.5 grams i am gonna weigh it not that i don't trust them but just want to be sure this thc wise is coming in at 206.1 milligrams per gram so we're looking at 20.6 percent thc um it's a sativa dominant strain so anything 20 plus i'd say is is pretty good going for um for something that is sativa dominant uh is there any more in interesting information on here it was packaged on the 10th of august 2020 today is february the 3rd 2021 so this was packaged half a year ago which is not the best but honestly i don't mind too much um i more go off actually how fresh the bud seems in the package because i've had pretty trashy cannabis that was packaged a couple of weeks before purchasing it and i've had really good cannabis that's been like seven eight months old in terms of the packaging date so obviously all things being equal i prefer my cannabis to be fresher but i'm not going to write it off just because it was packaged six or seven months ago so i'm gonna open it freshness seal that is really nice beautiful pungent smell a really really nice smell that i'd categorized it's got that that trademark hazy smell to it that that you'll find with any haze but it's very wow it's i'm getting very heavy notes of pine mixed with um like a sweetness and a fro a floralness um but the pine is is like it it smells like smells like when you break open like some wood or there's some sap and you get that really strong piney smell really nice and um the the buds are all like a decent size there's uh three four five decently sized buds in there say that's pretty decent you know there's not much shrapnel not huge buds but definitely not the smallest i've seen so i'm gonna weigh this and let's see how close we are to 3.5 grams all right 3.31 and i just got some shrapnel to go on okay so oh we're at 3.49 well it's hovering between 3.48 and 3.49 grams um i think i lost a tiny like little couple flecks when i was moving it over maybe that accounts for it so um that's that's close enough it's always a nice little treat when it's more than 3.5 but you know i can't i don't really have too much cause for for complaint for it to be uh 3.49 so yeah smell is um is really strong it's um definitely a pungent aroma smells like something that's probably gonna make me um giggle feel like the village idiot give me a super uh dry cottony mouth and yeah something that's probably gonna be just something you can kind of giggle or something active but we're gonna give it a try and before that i just want to have a look and share with you uh the prominent terpenes that are found in this strain so the first of the dominant terpenes found in the ghost train haze is a terpene called caryophyllene which is actually the primary terpene responsible for the the spiciness and aroma of black pepper it's also in other plants such as hops and it presents anti-bacterial anti-microbial and is a really powerful antioxidant and it can have a balancing effect in your cannabis the next dominant terpene found in ghost strain haze is a terpene called terpenoline now this turbine is uh more rarely found in cannabis plants which makes it quite exciting that's a dominant one in the ghost train haze it also has a slightly more uh complex layered scent or aroma um to this tarpin uh it could include some pineness um some herbaceousness um some floral possibly citrus kind of notes to it um it is being investigated for its antibacterial and its antifungal properties and there's also some early research being done looking at terpenoline and its role in helping to prevent heart disease so very interesting terpene the third most prominent terpene in the ghost train haze is a popular one called pinene very common in lots of cannabis strains of course it is also the most abundant terpene that is produced by trees so that fresh piney scent that you often get when you're walking through a forest it's the very same terpene that is present in these cannabis strains so of course very piney and scent it can be very invigorating and it's being investigated for its antibacterial and its anti-anxiety properties so those are the three most prominent terpenes um definitely fits with the smells that i was getting there um very strong pine um the citrusy and the the floral kind of sense that i was getting um all fit the bill uh with the terpenes there so good to know and i think now it's time to give the strain a little while for its money i'm going to be trying this in a dynavap this is a dry herb vaporizer that you can power using an electronic induction heater or a simple torch lighter very very well engineered awesome ecosystem of modular parts that you can pick up for it uh you really can't go wrong with dynavap i'm using a ziko single flame torch lighter i really like this um it's got an adjustable top here it just gets the job done really nicely bottoms up hmm really tasty very smooth i'm gonna take a few more hits before i decide too much on the effects but i'm starting to get a fairly good idea really good flavor if you are someone that likes to taste your cannabis definitely recommend a dynavap um or indeed any good dry herb vaporizer over smoking a j this is how you're going to get the true flavor the flavor did not let me down the onsets hit me pretty quickly and it is very um frontal lobe cerebral um for me personally probably not the type of strain that i would want to enjoy if i was going to be going into a new or social setting with that it can be hit or miss you know sometimes a gentle sativa can really help but other times could really pique my anxiety but i'm feeling this one to be pretty cerebral i think it would help with doing anything creative and it's kind of a nice one to just relax like i'm feeling pretty productive but i'm not feeling like agitated uh or or racy like like like i would with more of like a land race sativa so i'm really enjoying the effects of this it's uh it's pretty nice i feel reasonably clear-headed and i feel pretty relaxed [Music] well it is about one hour since i had a few little talks on my dynavap and gave my initial first thoughts towards ghost train haze i've had some time to reflect on this and i think it's one of those strains where dose control is really critical to achieving your desired outcome now of course everyone is different when it comes to cannabis your experience could be very different from mine always bear that in mind but for me small doses of this make me feel energized they help to relieve anxiety maybe not great for like productivity and focus but i haven't really been out of the house today and this kind of made me gave me the drive to go get my bike go on a cycle ride which i'm really happy about so it's obviously you know good for my well-being for my mental health i will be sticking to kind of like low doses of this um spread out throughout the day rather than you know smoking down like a whole joint of this and i feel like this is the same for being in social situations which hardly any of us are anymore unfortunately for now small doses could really help you feel social but large doses will probably have the opposite effect [Music] feathering that air hole now i know why i learned to play the recorder when i was six years old it was all in preparation for owning a dynavap oh man that feels so good that is so tasty i'm in a really great mood and i think i have color cannabis to thank for that thank you for bringing us the ghost train

to start i may go ahead and put it on members only mode so that way as i'm working if i look up and i see a question i know it's from one of the members and i can make sure i respond if i have time or at least get back to it lego you're gonna get in this runts guts right now yeah i feel like it's almost a sin almost to mix it with other [ __ ] but i'm gonna mix it with some of this ice cream cake oh [ __ ] [ __ ] balls isn't it crazy these two different rosins came out of the same room harvested at the same time processed the same exact way and they have such differences in color texture and smell and potency i mean everything it's not a one grammar it's a 0.3 maybe price machine is playing catch up right now i probably went through about 250 to 300 pounds of ice today getting the reservoir ready to go if it was summer and i didn't have this ice machine i probably wouldn't be making ash right now there's just no [ __ ] way i'd be able to keep up you guys make me wash too often damn it now i'm going to throw you down here for this melt shot because it's not often that i do the runt and the ice cream cake together in harmony i'm gonna sit down though because i feel like i'm about to [ __ ] myself over so hard so let me just sit my ass down right now okay yep am i comfortable yep i'm comfortable now cheers you guys [Music] oh yes let us go cheers it's all about to be uh on youtube bro uh you know when you blow smoke out and you think you're done then you go to talk or cough and more smoke just keeps on [ __ ] coming out that's how those low temp dabs hit all right let's get things started i gotta remember where the [ __ ] i'd be putting the camera in [ __ ] welcome to the daily dabbers all eyes on me all right let's get you guys so you guys know this setup i went ahead and bought some five gallon buckets today instead of using the uh big 20 gallon lids we're gonna use the five gallons since it's only two pounds we're not washing if it was three or four pounds i would maybe use the 20s but the fives should be able to handle it i gave them all a good alcohol bath today rinsed them out with real good cold water and made new bucket lids like i said so now each one has its own all the way down to the bottom so i'm using a 220 here then a 160 i'll collect everything between 160 and 220 and use it for edibles or test pressed whatever and then i have a 45 everything between 45 and 160 i'm going to use for full spectrum rosin and then 25 to 45 we may or may not end up using it we'll collect the first two to three washes if it's dumping we'll keep collecting if it's not we'll pull it out and not use it that's also going to be for test pressing so we got that and then underneath here we got a little pump a little eco plus pump power cable comes out this way it's plugged in when i need it to turn it on um and then the dump comes out this way a little ball valve here i'll turn it on when i need it and i drop it into here and uh got a p-trap and that goes out to my drain outside which drains it out in a way we got a huge 160 gallon res with ice cold water in there a couple hundred pounds of ice this [ __ ] has a jacket but it needs a beanie because it's sweating got the cold sweats and then we got the avanti not gonna be washing in the avanti today we're going to be washing by hand with the spoon 20 gallon wrapped in a pele using rosin evolution all mesh bags 5 gallon here 20 gallon here and uh yeah that's the plan just got it sitting on a cooler down here so it's stable and it's more at an appropriate height for me and i'm [ __ ] killing my back you know what i'm saying only thing is i wish this was longer and bigger and had a better handle come on loan where you at dog take care of me baby take care of me [Music] so what are we gonna do we're gonna do a couple things here finish prepping [Music] probably gonna need to add more ice in here once we get the where was i gonna put this over here like come on dog how high are you probably gonna get more ice in here later once this gets going spoon get it cold now we're gonna start prepping this okay oh yeah i'm gonna make some rso and i finally found my mason jar i'm gonna use it's my old gallon that we used to keep on the counter to drink water to fit perfect all those mace or all those hash pucks and it's got a spout even perfect i don't think he weighed them 100 percent i'm not sure if you mark them no so i'll grab the scale and get these weight up oh yeah you're gonna come with me in the house oh my magnificent wife brought it back outside to my workstation without me having to ask her and i didn't have to go get it that's because she's better than if it was something of hers that [ __ ] would still be out here i'd still have it she'd be pissed you guys know how this goes if you're married [Music] you know just that's just the way it is so anyways i'm glad she brought it back let's get this weighed out black and white of your logo yep got you okay whatever you need please i got you let's make it happen okay we're grams we're tearing out we got that [ __ ] okay 530 so 515 in this one and 515 and this one as well they're both exactly the same so about a thousand so the quality on the bud i'll show you oh [ __ ] [ __ ] wow i'm glad this is what i'm going next jesus that [ __ ] is dang that answer your question woof the smell it's like sweet sweet caramel gas this fire so we're going to get some ice on this first layer and then some bud some ice and there's some bud a ninja mice and then some buttons and some ice okay so we'll be back let me grab some ice so so [Music] [Music] two inch layer on the bottom here i guess i could show you super fire job on this man super fire job let's see how she dumps okay let's go grab some more ice i'll be back you guys can chill chill [Music] chill probably gonna have to grab my five gallon bucket okay we'll do one more just to make sure it's fully covered [Music] um so that's good we're gonna want this out of the way what am i stupid what what am i stupid almost forgot a bag and you know what's dope is he dried it the way i asked him to he dried it exactly how i asked him to and it came out exactly how i thought it would get some more ice so so [Music] so [Music] cool [Music] before we fill this up and get this heavy as [ __ ] we're gonna move around here [Music] hey i'm [ __ ] freezing my tits off already and this is even my thick one i'm about to run upstairs and get my thick one the [ __ ] thin one right here the summer one all right [Music] tetris tetris it's

good issue is my modem keeps dropping the internet connection it's not my router it's my modem because the internet says where the the motor or the router sees me stays connected [Music] the ice is so [ __ ] clear i couldn't even tell that most of the buds right here actually submerged already this first this first wash is going to be tough boy there's a lot of ice in here and this [ __ ] paddle is too small for this dub i just want to get all this submerged not sitting on the top don't worry i'll make the ocean sounds go i'll do it for the avanti all right that is about as we gonna get right there boy i tell you would cool 20 gallon 220 yeah took me three years to get the gopro yeah well back when i first had a gopro like the hero 3 you couldn't stream from the gopro at least not directly from it and i wasn't into streaming and all that background so i had no idea all right we're gonna let those hydrate i need it there we easy go to get that all underneath there all the ice is in the bag and now i just want to make sure that all of these buds stay underneath the water level so that they get hydrated it's so the water is so [ __ ] clear i mean it looks like you're not even looking through water almost at least on the gopro that i'm looking through she looks wild what's up no limit giveaway winner i've been getting so many copyright strikes let's try not to get one tonight what

of small businesses [Music] [Music] we all gotta eat you're gonna end at the fullest [Music] people that really [ __ ] make me wanna crap i'm just spinning [Music] [Music] [Music] that's moving good i like the feel just to write about a movement in there [Music] oh yeah [Music] [Music] the nugs in here are [ __ ] stupid fire i mean just [Music] all right my man hammy threw it down and if i'm not mistaken this may have just been a small tester tank i don't even think this was a full sin i think this was a tester the wedding crasher you pulled down [ __ ] fire you guys are going to go bananas over that honestly i'm only going to be running a couple pounds of it you guys might want to start putting in your pre-orders now because if there's a big enough demand then i might be able to run some more for you guys but if it's another two pounds that's just gonna be gone like i'm not even gonna put it out there for nobody it's just gonna be gone off rip off vip clientele it's crazy but estimated yield today um you know going off of the runs that i did previously with the runts that were pretty damn frosty um you know 20 average return from starting material to hash and then from there um you know average 75 to 80 percent back as rosin so [Music] we'll go from there we'll see probably about 130 to 150 grams of rosin out of this when all said and done but it really just depends not everything dumps the same some stuff you think it's gonna dump really really good because it's frosty but not always the case but this is [ __ ] gaff i can the smell is just all up through my nose still like sweet caramel baby [ __ ] tammy you neglected to tell me there was a baby [ __ ] smell in there it says sweet caramel [Music] flyer this is like sweet caramel and baby [ __ ] there's no just floating by [Music] [Music] keep on floating bye [Music] [Music] dried before freezing is the only way my personal opinion is if you're washing it fresh frozen you are losing out on the maximum potential because i feel like once you let it dry you get rid of some of that water content the terpenes become more concentrated you lose that chlorophyll taste i haven't had fresh frozen yet that didn't have that green fresh frozen paint to it so drying is a must in my opinion quick dry though not a normal 14 day dry like a six seven day dry works good uh-oh internet might have dropped you're gonna need oh it reconnected huh seeing here people always ask me if there's like a way to stir it personally find your groove whatever the [ __ ] works to make the motion in the ocean you do it i personally like to do a grabbing motion so i'll push all this down and stir it and come up on this back end push down stir come up on the bathroom so that's that's kind of my technique and then go back the other way you get you know at the top layer you know i'm only about three or four inches below the surface right here i want to go oh you know that's bottomed out right there i don't need to go bottomed out but every once in a while i do want to go to the bottom and pull that material up so i can mix that right push down and pull towards me that's another one i like to do [Music] [Music] so uh [Music] oh yeah oh yeah we in here [Music] ah [Music] is [Music] oh yeah i don't know if you see them i see it i see them heads in there and there's a lot of them so we're going to let this chili chill chill you know the dividend diversity in honor of our 50th anniversary and while we do that scholarship funds because we believe in the pursuit of purpose and the difference you make in the world [Music] what [Music] you let your wife borrow the scale one time [Music] don't do that oh [Music] time to fold all [ __ ] days [Music] so [Music] so [Music] number two ain't no feet [Music] my oh no mystic needs to feature me on one of their songs i got bars man i can't afford that feature though can't afford that feature i want 10 racks for every [ __ ] four bars [Music] all right trash let's take a dab of roni eat your bronies yeah bro this is mystic [Music] [Music] um [Music] i feel you ain't smoking and uh [Music] that [ __ ] in there y'all don't know he's talking about me right [Music] i wish [Music] [Music] i'm dabbing runts and i'm smelling mindo woo wee woo wow [Music] oh [Music] [Music] so so the way that i do this is i use the avanti as a storage vessel can i move you over there that far i don't know maybe let me see yeah so i use the avanti as a storage vessel [Music] [Music] [ __ ] cold in here like foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so what i'm gonna do is i didn't realize you're like right there on my [ __ ] ball sack but i'm gonna empty the uh the washer real quick because uh this is a fresh run and that's what we do in between every run you guys know this stick that drain hose in there plug in the washer turn it on switch to drain mode boom it's going to start draining so i'm going to take the plug for the pump that's in here and i'm going to go ahead and put it in to my power strip here now when i need it i turn it on when i donate it i turn it off and i obviously just blew that down with over 130 programs and certificates gives you the opportunity to start or continue your education wherever you are what do i have plugged we're committed to making your experience english and rewarding when you choose open you join a community where success and affordability okay that is right now one more time this time i'm gonna make sure that i'm getting fresh cold water out of the [Music] drain [Music] it's 58 degrees in here [Music] and dabs got me feeling warm [Music] we haven't changed [Music] [Music] cool yes i smell it boys i always smell the water in here it's not a habit i don't want it to smell stale at all this smells stale then you got a [ __ ] problem but i rinse pulled out water through it before and after everything i do cold ro water it's deionized and desterized so came out nice and clear and the reason i do that is because i'm getting ready to use it as a storage vessel for the bag that i'm about to pull out which means that i need it to be very clean you know what i'm saying clean and fresh [Music] [Music] my process for this is not a a gracious one by any means not at the moment especially because s9 steel works just went mia and hasn't answered any dms in weeks about that 2400 vessel i was trying to purchase from them they told me oh it's going to ship in a week and then [ __ ] m.i.a so i'm kind of upset with them you know what i mean that's kind of [ __ ] right [Music] [Music] and [Music] so fantastic i've been lifting [ __ ] trash cans full of ice up over my shoulder all [ __ ] day long filling this up i think it took [ __ ] like 10 of these at least if not more now the advantage i had with my other one when i was running um the 20 gallon catch containers is it was a lot easier to catch all of this but i'm lifting this up so i could use a pump i could scoop this [ __ ] out honestly [Music] but let me see how heavy this is first go from there i'm going to come up with a more disabled veteran friendly way you got what i mean so i put this in the corner so it can't roll away [Music] and then this is pretty solid i'm just going to take this up kind of set it on here slow pour and hopefully it doesn't go away you know like [ __ ] 20 gallons of water compassionate [Music] [Music] [ __ ] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] oh my god let me show you what's coming out of the bottom of this [ __ ] bin right now oh i'm gonna change my underwear first [ __ ] god damn son [Music] you guys already know what i'm gonna do with hash like that right you guys already i'm skeeting all over y'all bangers with this [ __ ] drop [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] is [Music] so before i filter what's in the bags i'm gonna fill this up so that everything in here is gonna stay really really cold it's gonna stay colder when it's filled up with uh water versus when it's open air right now so look at what we're catching in the [ __ ] 220 come on look where's this y'all see that [ __ ] 220 come on bruh you dumping in here we dumping in here good job you pulled it at the perfect [ __ ] time my perfect [ __ ] time that guy [Music] [Music] uh [Music] i need a big ass hammy slap trying to put a pork chop up here [Music] and actually you would be the first co-lab that i have a sticker up on my wall from wow oh that's not enough water i'm gonna go less water than last time but more water than this [Music] oh [Music] here's here's a good trick people say how do you know if you have enough ice you have enough water you want enough ice that it's gonna keep the water as cold as possible right around like you know 30 38 degrees is cool enough you know 28 to 38 is good you don't want to go above 42 and uh [Music] make sure it's covered the material enough to where you can easily move the material around with your stirrer with one hand and then you know move all the material it's not like they're fighting it just kind of fluidly move [Music] and it's covered and uh yeah that's good enough and then now i'm just going to take the back of the spoon and kind of push everything down right below the surface this is where having that ice on top helps because it helps a little [ __ ] sweet there it uh helps hold the bud down underneath the surface of the water so if you need to add more ice now is a good time [Music] okay we're gonna let this chili chill chill and then after uh we get done sifting this we'll come back and stir this [Music] um [Music] i need to go inside and get batteries because the 10 more washers staying [ __ ] dead right now for free visit minute clinic at cvs today no cost flu shots with most insurance restrictions apply so clinic.com replacing tetris here you ready [Music] [Applause] him [Music] takes me back to high school buckingham [Music] [Music] [Music] now i'm going to open up this valve yo this thing the magnets are like going like [ __ ] ah that's not what she said [Music] is [Music] right sorry i'm trying to get you guys set up [Music] i have to sponsor this man and get him some proper recording equipment all right that's good enough [Music] so [Music] [Music] this is the 220 my boys [Music] [Music] what [Music] trash [Music] alcohol wipes [Music] [Music] oh yeah [Music] there we go that goes back a nice one this goes to the side now here we have our 160. this is going to be test press material most likely but we'll see what happens [Music] it's up to the farmer what happens really with it it could become it's usually the way i do it is it's test press and then depending on the quality it either gets mixed in with the rest because some strains really do feel better at the higher microns so depending on how well it does you know it'll either go with everything else or it'll just get made into edibles or something [Music] it could be pills could be whatever stash for the homies right like a lot of times this 160 will make fire head stacks for the homies and you don't have to dip into your uh you know your normal full spectrum spot it's not gonna hit the fan [Music] okay cool so there's just not a whole lot of that and that is good good good that means majority of what we want is in the 45 where it belongs [Music] taking this where's deals at deals is in here [Music] shout out to the cultivator everybody [Music] okay oh my god oh i love it when the 160 comes out looking like this you guys remember how the runts 160 came out looking well hammy's mendo it came out looking just as good i do not i have never said that about another person's material that i've ran except for my own like straight up be honest as [ __ ] call it snobby call it what you want but i've ran a lot of [ __ ] material and it takes one hell of a [ __ ] grower to pull off 160 micron hash that comes out looking like that like and i'm not even in good light damn it but it's a little [ __ ] caked up mountain the [ __ ] white 160 here looking proper you guys know because you've seen me process enough material you know not a lot of collab material comes out looking that good period and that's the 160 we're not even on to the real deal holyfield yet so set this one aside now you're not ready for this 45. [Music] [Music] oh [Music] we're gonna get rid of some of this water first so we're gonna pick up both the 25 and the 45. give them a little shimmy shimmy [Music] hammy um what ppfd were you running for your 11 13 do you know what dli you were hitting sorry i'm loud right there oh [ __ ] the wife's gonna come down and not be able to walk wife's coming to take it down [Music] oh [Music] some people don't go as long as me on the first wash i like to get all the chlorophyll that i can out on the first wash the first wash was always going to have the most contaminant it doesn't matter how long you wash it for so you might as well just go ahead and get all the pores all out that you can [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm going to spend a little extra time just washing it down making sure i wash my floor full out the best of my ability remember what i tell you guys you're not just filtering the water you're washing the hash you're not washing the nugs okay you're you're washing the house [Music] ready baby do you have shoes on you got chocolates on okay cool come on in baby they can't see you it's pointing straight down [Music] i think it's cold i don't know it's 57 degrees in here [Music] [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] who's your dad [Music] jesus take the wheel i still got work to do you swap the deck real quick on the banger [Music] [Music] those of you that are hanging out i go live every day every morning doing gross [ __ ] processing [ __ ] talking [ __ ] doing [ __ ] just cool [ __ ] man we got some cool people come check it out [Music] it's called the daily dab [Music] i put it on members only mode most of the time where everybody could watch and you know but only members can chat and ask questions and you know but for the first 20 or 30 minutes it's usually open to everybody [Music] so come on over and check it out [Music] wash the [ __ ] half don't just filter it wash that [ __ ] homies wash wash it wash it wash it wash it how much water is going in that bucket it's gone you don't even know it's empty all right [Music] [Music] um you guys aren't ready for this [ __ ] i'm not ready for this [ __ ] watch excuse me excuse me chef chef i'd like one mindo breath hash burrito please hold the cheese extra salt for all of my haters that's a fat dumper for our first year my boy tammy who washes your hash like me let me hear you say it nobody breaking babe nobody i'm just playing [Music] but i do it with love and care like it's my own like it's my [ __ ] home you guys want a high def picture of that from the phone um [Music] let me turn off that [Music] i almost forgot that i unplugged my sump pump out there so i had to go plug that back in [Music] one [Music] um [Music] [Music] so [Music] yeah i i found out you [ __ ] yes you weren't in here when i was telling you you're a dick that's the first thing i [ __ ] said is it smells like a straight hot baby diaper oh funny he dried it with my quick drape my quick dry technique baby i told you guys i've been doing it that way for five [ __ ] years now five [ __ ] years let somebody tell you that they've been doing it longer this fresh frozen [ __ ] shenanigan ring what in the [ __ ] is going on with that all right we'll capture the rest of this next [ __ ] go around okay i got it now we're going to see what the 25 looks like and if it's worth um keeping at all and if not we're going to get rid of that [ __ ] and not mess with it because it slows down the filter process for everything else i thought yeah pretty much everything else above it so great [ __ ] baby [ __ ] you know um my buddy goodbye [ __ ] has a cut of ice cream cake that's the exact same [ __ ] way and it is your [ __ ] god awful stanky good [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [ __ ] you 25 micron appreciate you savage um so savage said how long did it take me to get where i'm at now any growing tips you want to work your way up so basically um i started growing at the end of 2014 with my very first grow and my very first time getting high i started with a 4x4 tent a 600 watt air cooled hps and a 15 gallon tote where i did deep water culture with two plants [Music] i ran a strain called gold leaf from a site called i love growing marijuana and i had acupuncture gold and something else and off that 600 watt i ended up yielding uh 21 ounces um which i was [ __ ] thrilled about because my first grow in a [ __ ] 15 gallon dwc show [Music] so the 25 is going to go on the same tray as the 160 on the other side though so growing tips i would say do as much research as you can about basic plant science and plant nutrition photosynthesis right what the different nutrients do for the plant how they show up as deficiencies or toxicities all of these things have been thoroughly researched and documented in scientific ways not on forums that you can get a really really good understanding of what you're going to be doing before you go to do it which is going to put you ahead of the game and you're not just going to be doing something based on the fact that somebody told you to do it when it comes to your grow you're going to do something based off of somebody recommended something and your research shows x y or z so you know then you choose how you want to buy it or not apply it but um you know it just i would say stick to learning from like dot edu's you know look up just scholarly journals um try and find out pretty much as much science as you can about the plant the anatomy of the plant and its functions the circadian rhythm you know i would say start off by picking a very simple nutrient program like a two-part salt based program it'll be cheap effective and um reliable consistent athena is good um hvg like ham bones running is really good all right it's gonna be a long one folks i think i'm gonna have to uh [Music] all right this chat is bumping i don't know how you guys are keeping up with it i'm on top chat right now i just realized that all right so now i'm on live chat let me get this out of the way it's still got a small amount of draining it's doing but not a whole lot better yet oh no don't die i plugged you in at that three percent i plugged you in though if it dies i'm coming right back y'all already know baby so oh my god i forgot to move that over for the wife so now i gotta go over here move it from over here over here [Music] anymore i cannot wait to move into a bigger [ __ ] area i underestimated my own growth and didn't realize i was gonna need as much space as i do you know here's what it is it's not a bad thing good thing no problem right first yeah it's time management how you want to throw your bag like that's why i have a nine to five hound bone has a nine to five andy hustles you know what i'm saying you gotta do what you gotta do when you got [ __ ] family to provide for and you wanna live a certain lifestyle and provide you know a certain amount of security and for your future and your children's future you gotta you gotta hustle you gotta put in that overtime you gotta sacrifice you know like tonight i'm gonna probably get three hours of sleep if that and that's okay i'm gonna wake up early tomorrow with the kids so my wife could sleep in and i'm gonna [ __ ] hustle throughout the day like it's another day so that's just what you do [Music] how cold did you get the room at the end tammy [Music] i like how far the it calyxed out i don't see a lot of people crown their buds out as much as you do it's something that i was taught to do as well if your calyx's crown out towards the end you nailed it and if you don't know what a crowned out calyx is it's probably because you're getting that pgr [ __ ] where it just looks like a [ __ ] golf ball with sprinkles on it i get so tired of people trying to tell me that they don't pgr their bud but it literally has no type of calyx terrain there's no it's just a straight just [ __ ] dense ass hard ass smooth surface that doesn't happen [Music] naturally one thing i've experimented with a couple times that works really well if you have the ability to chill your reservoir a little bit and you start tapering it towards flush it'll start bringing those colors out a little bit more and i noticed with the temperature drop it affects you know some plants more than others because they're more exposed to that temperature and the wind and they get that wind chill coldness but if you hit them at the root zone it affects like almost all of the plants the same way and so you can drop the internal temperature of the plant and get some of that purpling the same way and get it more across the whole canopy you know you do it in combination with the air temps just don't drop it too much in the root zone or otherwise you're gonna pretty much like stop uptake i ran a whole entire crop at um 58 degrees which is the temperature at which you can hit 100 dissolved oxygen supposedly and uh since i ran it at 58 degrees since the start of clone i didn't run into any issues with uptake and they were super productive and uh one of my best fields did that aeroponics [Music] nice oh my god smack that ass mindo sexy [ __ ] [Music] yeah you guys take advantage of the fact that um we actually have the grower on right now that's a very rare occasion that we get the grower on with us so definitely take advantage of that we're gonna let that chili chill chill for a minute [Music] [Music] froze it all without drying ah that sucks too late [Music] too now i have to run inside grab a drink real quick we're gonna let this settle for a second i'll be right back and we're gonna continue to party [Music] [Music] don't really know", "R5Uw5uggpNo": "what's going on YouTube this is a week three flower that dose train haze and I'm telling you some buzz is really getting her that little one are so darling the last beauty oh look this [ __ ] got tall [Applause] I'm telling I'll [ __ ] with number at that so I'm telling great legs that's the only song I'm [ __ ] with that [ __ ] has done wonders and he just gave me last time I didn't really get a chance to get real close up on the buzz but I monkey I which I long right now I'm a beautiful even with the leaves turning yellow it's still beautiful there you know it's perfect you know a lot of people you see they video they leave curling up is either too hot or too day and cold or something like that but I'm telling you have no problems look at this one in the back my [Applause] like I said I'll keep y'all updated and I'll do another one next week and I'll see how to buzz", "RGqBQ7dKcxU": "all right so I kept calling this train wreck I think but it's not it's ghost train haze by rerd Agnes upside down ghost rain haze don't strain haze I keep saying that so don't forget it's not train wreck ghost train hey dude ghost train haze anyway focus is here that's what she looks like she's really little I don't know how old it is not that old whatever popped it out of the little cup here yesterday the topper has gone to the bottom I hasn't really filled in so I gently put it back in there let her stay in there another week it's starving for light because I got dry plants in the Badger women's we're living in two weeks so this thing will pop off when I transplant it and get it under some real light dose train haze very daintiness", "yWf5YVVLork": "hey let's have you guys doing this is Neil from perfect son LED comm bringing you guys a grow update and this is the critical haze by delicious seeds under the perfect son max yield and the perfect son megastar which is now the mega and those are available both are available in stock right now on the site so check those out this is equivalent to 1000 watt double into bulb this is equivalent to a 1000 watt standard bulb and yeah so really awesome and now this basically only think the only difference between this and the mega now is the mega is a square like this like I just wanted both I wanted all my lights to be squares I still I'm still thing about making the door star square we'll see okay so let's go and watch this video and I'll give you guys up to here so for those that don't know she's growing in a 14 litre fabric pot so that's what she's growing in and she's doing great we're not 14 liter sorry 14 gallon stuff 14 gallon sorry about that I think it's like 52 liters something like that and she has some yelling going on so I'll describe what was going on with that just keep in mind that when you're growing under LED especially my LEDs it's super important that you use extra Cal max so even if you're using a nutrient that already has a lot of calcium magnesium in it like psycho flower nutrients for example already has a lot of Cal mag in it you need to use extra so I used three milliliters per gallon extra on top of a minimum of two but three three milliliters works really good on top of what's already in the nutrients now that's because LEDs require the plant to have more cal-mag and and I've had people that you know use their same regimen they use under HPS and then when they start using my lights they're like whoa I'm having these issues and stuff I'm like use more calm and everything goes everything is fine so super important to use calm act plus if you're going organically don't rely on powder nutrients and stuff to get your cal Mac I highly recommend to use a liquid organic comback supplement you can use one by general hydroponics they have an organic line of their of their calcium magnesium just keep in mind it doesn't last the shelf life is not as long because it is organic but you know you're gonna be going through it a lot couldn't be using three milliliters per gallon right anyway so yeah do that super-important make sure to feed them liquid so I don't get in there very often oh yeah another reason why you want to use more Cal mag is because of cocoa so two reasons if you're going with HPS and you're in cocoa still use extra cop mag if you're in HPS and you're using like soil or something like that pretty much if you're if you're growing hydroponically use extra cop mag but if you're growing like in soil or something like that don't worry buddy probably don't need extra combat but honestly I never had a plant not benefit from it so I would always add at least two milliliters per gallon or at least one milliliter per gallon of cal-mag even if you're growing in soil anyway so what happened is I don't get in there matter of fact I've only been in there one time that was that one video I recorded a while ago when I was in there so I don't it's harder in video like right now once the leaves get to this point it's really easy to see which ones are turning yellow but when I'm in what if I'm in there I would have saw it a long time ago but all I happen to go by his videos because I don't get in there and it's its health its health issues which are private so I'm not going to share what it is just know that it makes it very difficult to just be alive anyway so nonetheless I have to go buy videos in order to see kind of what's happening and sometimes it's really hard to see on the video exactly how you know light green or different green they are and so when they were lighted green it was really hard for me to tell because it's only a few leaves here and there and the video video makes it harder to see so I really have to rely on her looking at it and you know she's still learning but by time I I was able to see I was like okay well let's figure out what's going on and I went through the whole thing I checked you know how had her check the runoff the pH runoff the TDS all that kind of stuff and everything looked fine so I'm like what else could it be you know and so I was like what are you feeding them I had to go through everything you know step by step and like how much count are you feeding them it's like way that's too little so it's really important when you're doing organic that you still feed the calcium and magnesium don't like not do that and the thing is with even though this is hydroponically growing that is we're watering every day to runoff and it's in cocoa in which is a hydroponic medium and we're treating it that way if you're growing organically the organic nutrients don't they have to be broken down by microbes and stuff so that the plant doesn't readily have available to it like it does with psycho flower nutrients right the synthetic nutrients like it's like being hooked up to an IV whereas the organic nutrient is like I'm just going to play this again the organic nutrient is like eating regular eating with your mouth you know eating regular food so you don't get the nutrients right away yet like break it down and stuff and so even though you're feeding it this stuff it doesn't really have it available but the the calcium magnesium if you're using you if you're using the organic line bi jahi japonic it's pretty much readily available to the plant that's already been broke down by enzymes and that's the case with most organic liquid kal mags they've been broken down by enzymes so they're pretty much ready available to the plant where the plant you know the the soil doesn't it doesn't have to break it down or in this case the Coco the living Coco doesn't have to break it down but all the other nutrients so if you're not feeding it that extra cal-mag the plant is having a hard time getting that stuff because it has to break it down the living Coco has to break that down all the living organisms that we put inside the Coco have to break all that down and make it available including everything else the nitrogen all that kind of stuff so it takes longer to see a Bennett to see a change so if you if you forget to give it cal-mag and then by time you see the change it's already been like at least a week since it started having this issue but time you're seeing the signs of issue that issue has been happening probably for at least a week and then and then when you fix it it takes longer for it to fix when you're going when you're working organically now if we were working synthetically it can fix itself really fast you can see a change within a couple days because it's like it's like you put it to an IV very similar to human being and if the human being was was malnutritioned if you just hooked up to an IV and started giving all the vitamins he needs he's gonna absorb that a lot faster and recover a lot faster than if you were to try to give them orally you know have him eat them and stuff because in the body has to break everything down and it's harder and it's also easier if the body is sick to dis intravenously feed him the body has an easier time assimilating those vitamins and minerals and stuff anyway so that's that so that's some of the downfalls of organic growing is that it is slower at seeing problems and stuff like that but everything's looking healthy and happy there like I said there are a few leaves that suffer from that but I think she was already recovering so it should be fine and matter-of-fact already right now it's only two days from this video we only just now recently corrected this so only two two days from this video and I think it's already looking better so that is the other leaves the newer leaves are looking darker and everything's looking happy so yeah cal-mag super super important don't don't go cheap on it you know don't try to skip it it's absolutely vital to your grow your grow success to use it yeah so anyway that's that I could say if you're going organically make sure if you're using powdered versions to get your calcium and magnesium just make sure that your plant has plenty of it available to it and that you keep everything happy and healthy with the microbes and stuff you know just keep keep your soil or your living Coco super happy so the plant has access to all that and yeah so that's that and I don't I didn't you know what when the way I grow organically I don't have a bunch of powdered versions or you know versions like my nutritional don't have a lot of natural calcium magnesium in it so they have to get it from the calcium magnesium that I add extra to it I did want to talk about one other one other thing and that is for those that care about this topic is hydro versus synthetic I mean I've been thinking about this you know a lot and especially more recently like I've thought about a lot over the years but I've definitely been thinking about it more recently and especially with food growing like growing your own food and when I was thinking of I'm like okay so what is the main benefit of organic growing when it comes to food one you can make sure you get all your your micronutrients all that kind of stuff but can you not do that synthetically as well yes okay so then what's really the benefit of growing organically the only benefit of growing organically from that point right is it I guess one you know your food is all organic that is you know all the nutrients come from natural sources and that's cool for like helping the environment so about that because synthetic to make synthetic nutrients does take resources it takes you know coal or whatever to turn to turn other materials you know to return to go through the breaking down process usually takes non-clean non-green methods I think there are green methods I just don't know if any of the companies are using green methods to make their synthetic nutrients so there is that but outside that if you ignore all the environmental stuff and everything and just focus on only the nutrients in the plants or how good the marijuana is the frosting is all that kind of stuff the benefit you get directly from the plants to you the consumer I'm going to talk about the food first and we'll talk about the marijuana because it applies to both and I think understanding how it will affect the food will help understand how it affects the marijuana in a similar way and so the main the main benefit then it's not not going to be nutrients like it doesn't matter that the plant got its if it up took its nutrients synthetically or organically it doesn't matter like the plants the nutrients I'd the plant is still organic so in other words if I feed synthetic nitrogen to my plant and then I cut her down and I eat it I'm not eating synthetic nitrogen right the night that the plant the root zone changes that nitrogen the plant changes that nitrogen to an organic version so the nitrogen that you're getting from the plant that you're eating is not synthetic it's organic right it's fun the plant itself so it doesn't change anything that way as far as what you're getting into your body the the minerals and everything that the plant produces that you need for health you know the calcium it produces the minerals that produces the vitamins it produces all those or organic produced by the plant it's not like you dump vitamin A into your soil and and synthetic vitamins your soil then the planet takes it now you're eating synthetic by me that's not how it works so there's no there's no benefit as far as nutrients as long as you give the plant everything it needs so if you use something like cycle flour nutrients that has all your micronutrients it has your your well has your okay has your macronutrients has your micronutrients has your super micronutrients and so pretty much has everything you need the only thing that's missing is what every new trainers furniture is including organic nutrients and that's why I want to use something like rock dust azomite and also maybe even use something like c90 or liquid seaweed - that has a lot of your trace minerals but c90 has a lot of it as well and so all you have to do is add a little bit of rock dust or azomite to your cocoa and grow a synthetic and you're gonna get all those trace minerals and maybe water with c90 once in a while and that's going to give your plants all that all the trace minerals so you have all the macronutrients all the micronutrients and you have all the trace minerals if you do that that's everything that the plant needs they if you're growing organically you're doing the same thing so it's getting everything it needs in it now maybe who knows maybe there's something with the relationship with with the the fungi the micro uzi and the bacteria in the root zone working together maybe there's some other thing that happens to the plant that we don't know scientifically yet but as far as the nutrients that are produced all like there's no difference between the two plants it's good you can now now that know so you asked what's the main benefit then well the main benefit is it's a lot it's easier even by accident to get your plant to go into producing a lot more sugar in the leaves and stuff like that so to reach this high sugar content and your plant material is easier organically because basically if you're growing organically all the there's a there's a relationship between the bacteria and the fungi and the root zone of the plant the plant produces extra sugar to feed those to feed those organisms and in it and if you're feeding just a little bit of sugar organically like once a week or something it's a little bit of sugar once a week by a little bit sugar I mean like maybe a teaspoon you know per like five gallons of water you don't need that much maybe maybe if you want you can use the tablespoon but that's I think that's overboard just a little bit sugars enough to keep all those bacterias super happy so now the bacteria has all the sugar they need and so the plant that's producing extra sugar keeps producing extra sugar because that semiotic relationship but then it doesn't really get the you know it doesn't because they are they have their own sugar that sugar kind of stays in the plant so you have a higher sugar content in the plant this is awesome this is what you want for food big time because you want your food to taste sweeter now this does I think with marijuana it when you have a higher sugar content in your plant it does seem to make the plant more frosty and that's like the main benefit of growing organically okay but can you do that synthetically you can't remember one of my last grows I did that synthetically remember I had sugar literally coming out of my buds right and that like and that's awesome when that happens and that net and that those plants were really really frosty like extra frosty for those strains so how you get that to happen then is I just I was feeding some extra enhancer to happen to have some sugar in it that's why I have to do is just feed a little bit sugar not you don't need much like a teaspoon for like five gallons of water you don't need that much you don't have to do every day like every couple days or something and and then when you do that so the plant has it does something bit like triggers or something and it has extra sugar and so the plant produces extra sugar but if you want to be sure to get this to happen then just use a little root zone so if you start your plant off a little bit of root zone you'll get enough bacteria around the root zone even though you're feeding synthetically you'll get enough bacteria around the root zone just keep feeding a little sugar every you know three days to once a week that keeps the the bacteria alive there's a kind of a symbiotic relationship there they also the bacteria will also help the synthetic nutrients up uptake easier so you might have to use less nutrients than what you're used to and that will make sure that you you enter into that high sugar content for your plants and there you go so and the benefit of of doing it that way and I think one of the main benefits of of synthetic growing is it so immediately available to the plant it's easier to grow because it's easier to see if anything is going wrong it's easy to know that everything the plants get everything it needs with organic you really have to make sure that that balance of living organism everything is happy and correct because if that's at that balance isn't correct and there the plant isn't going to get all the nutrients it needs and it's harder to make the plant have that extra boost of nutrients that hydroponics give your plants so even though I'm doing a hydroponic organic mixture because this the the nutrient is so much slower the plant is so much it has a harder time up taking exams to break it down the the living Co class to break all that down and give it to the plant they it the plant tends to only take as much as it needs whereas when you're feeding it intravenously it takes whatever you give it whatever it can take so when you're growing synthetically the same method but you use my synthetic nutrients like psycho flower just the way I teach to grow my book by the way my book is on my website the links in the description perfect son led calm check it out has my whole guitar grow system in there foolproof anyone can do it just follow step by step and you'll have a successful grow anyway so when you when you do it that way the plant takes up more nutrients because it has to it's kind of like if I feed you a bunch of food by mouth there's only so much food you can eat by your mouth and you're just like oh and I can't force you no more food right it's just like you just can't but I can hook up nutrients into your vein I can kill you with it because your body has no choice it's just gonna take up all those nutrients I give it to you and I give you too much potassium you have a heart attack and die so you can also hurt the plant that way it's much easier hurt the plant but we don't feed we don't over feed our plants we feed them to just enough nutrients but we can boost them a little bit more we can get them feeding them feeding them just a little bit heavier they get a little bit more nutrients than they do if they're going if they're growing organically and because we pump them with some what's light with the max yield and stuff we're giving them so much light that they can uptake those extra nutrients and benefit from it and give bigger growth and so I'm not sure it's possible growing organically to get the same kind of you even if you're doing my new my new method here the living cocoa hydroponic method I still think that this plant will grow as fast and vigorous as if you were to do it synthetically and so I might go ahead and finish her off synthetically cuz I know that'll give me a bigger yield but anyway nonetheless the organic method is great and you know it's awesome but I'm not sure you're gonna benefit much from doing the hydroponic living cocoa method of it then if you were to just do a regular method I've in other words if you fed every other day I think you'd probably get pretty much the same results but you know I'd have to do some side by side to be sure on that but just think about the logic of it and and the science of it seems that it not need a whole lot of benefit just because the plant can't feed fast enough to really benefit from I think the hydroponic method anyway so nonetheless that that's what I think and I've seen people do like organic like true or true liquid organics with deep water culture and those plants don't seem to benefit much from the Hydra from the deep water culture as they do from synthetics in other words you put if you put the same strain side-by-side and do one one deep water culture bucket with synthetics like psycho flower and the other one with liquid true liquid organics not like fake organic but true liquid organic you know it has to be broken down and there's you know you're using you're using like white shark because you have to have that in there is that what it's called anyway it's basically the yeah it's basically a version of my crazy stuff that you can use inside of a deep water culture bucket a white shark that's what it's calling it i it's super expensive but so they use something like that to break all the neutrons down I haven't seen them grow as fast or as big as the synthetic version so that'd be an interesting experiment to do I never actually done that experiment myself to do a side-by-side you know caught you know all the same strain all the same clones same grow environment everything's the same same same room and everything and then the only difference is as one bucket you know couple buckets make sure do like four four cuttings for each you know so eight cuttings total four for the organic and four for then when it make sure it's true organics it has to be absolutely true liquid organics like it has to be the slow it can't be pre broken-down because if you take an organic and you pre break it down with enzymes like technically at still organic and I guess the enzymes organic so everything everything was done organically and that's like the best way to do it but then you're then then you're you're basically given it's something that is very similar to the synthetic it's it's already broken down into its more base nutrients and it's smaller so the plant does not to break it down and that that will be faster but I think even then I don't I don't think you're gonna be like it I don't think you're in B look at the same yield and the same fastness of growth as you would out of the synthetic so so my conclusion basically is that outside of something that science just doesn't know yet and outside of obviously environmental reasons like that but as far as just what the plant gives you in return I don't really know the benefit of organic vs. and this kind of this kind of contradicts some of the videos I made but I decided I was thinking I was giving more thought to it like wait a minute what benefit is there really you know like can I can I not achieve everything with synthetics as I could and I can now with marijuana and like I said the only the main benefit is that extra Foss growth you can get that there like I said just to make sure you get it just use some down-to-earth you know right from the beginning so when you first transplant your plant with the roots right you put it into the cocoa just sprinkle some root zone by down to earth that's all around the roots and then in the in the little hole you're going to put it in and bam and that should be enough to to have you'd have enough growth of bacteria so that in my crazy so everything's happy and yeah just feed him sugar like every two days every three days once a week yeah I would just do like every three or four days honestly I think that'd be fine and just like one teaspoon for five gallons of water is all you need if that maybe only do it once a week and that's all it needs and then it'll be happy good to go or you can just do a tea you know buy boogie brew once a week and that's gonna not only and also do down-to-earth but that's gonna read give it its and give it all the food the bacteria needs is also gonna give it more bacteria if you want to do something like that I still I don't think that's even necessary but you could do that alright cool so that's pretty much it the main benefit of organic growing is is that when you're in soil if you use a good soil you can also make your own you can get away with not watering every day so you can water once the plants dry and what that what that allows you is it well it's a little bit easier on you if you have the water by hand but if you're watering the drip feed system it doesn't matter anyway because you're not you're not really gonna do any extra work but that's one of the main benefits I can see is that you can go a couple days without watering if you're watering by hand and you're still going to get the mate the same benefit and if you're using a really good quality soil and you're using quality organic methods like pretty much do is equity what I'm talking about but just wait until the plant dries out more everything that I've said in my video about the living coco hydroponic just don't want everyday water every three days whatever its water until the plant starts to get light and then water again or even water every day if you need to it doesn't matter it's not gonna really hurt it either way so if you follow that then you can kind of get more lazy with your watering that's like the main benefit of it I guess is you can be more lazy with watering and you can still get really good quality and really good yields out of it it's just you're not gonna get the same I don't think the same bigness of yield as if you do my method as I teach in my book that isn't that is the main method I use and so it's food also what add the benefit you get out of your food if you want a high sugar content in your food or a higher sugar content in your leaves you want your you want your lettuce to taste a little bit sweeter and stuff I've already talked about how to do this synthetically it's it you can achieve the same thing and then if you want all the trace minerals just use a little bit of you know the C 90 or a mixture of a little bit of C 90 plus the azomite and we use as a my period it's really good stuff rock dust now I'm not going to trace minerals add a little bit of liquid seaweed to your feeding so when you're doing your PK boost and stuff add something or just do liquid seaweed every time you feed when you're in flour or just throughout the entire grow if you want to do that as a lot of the extra minerals and the extra trace minerals and things like that and then using I was the other option you could use those those three things and you could do all three of them if you want to you can just do the c90 like that you don't you don't need all their this stuff honestly the sea 90 has all the trace minerals everything you need or you can just do to liquid seaweed and rock dust I would do both liquid seaweed and rock dust and the sea 90 is really just extra you don't really need it if you're doing both of those things or you can just do the sea 90 not do they're the two things you know or you can do all three it doesn't matter you're either way you're getting all the trace minerals everything you need yeah so that's how to get all the stuff you want your food and because the something a good quality nutrient has all the stuff you need in it already all the micronutrients all that kind of stuff you're good to go but anyway up to you how you want to do that but just thought I would share my thoughts on it and yeah I think that and only thing I can think of is if there's some something about that organic relationship that does something to the planet that we just don't scientifically know yet it does give some sort of benefit to it that helps us then I really don't know what the true but that's only for food for smoking marijuana there's there's really no difference I can't see anything that would make it to where it changes the THC is on that but there might be something with organic growing with food wise that might add some sort of minerals or something but I mean we pretty much know everything that's in in plants and in food that benefits us and even stuff that doesn't benefit us we've broken it down to a chemical thing so there have to be something something beyond science right now that that's happening would that symbiotic relationship and it produces something in the plant that we just haven't discovered yet that helps us or something like that some would say the flavor is different I think if you grew your own food hydroponically you get the the same the people say the exact same thing right when they grow their own food indoors hydroponically they're like oh my god is so good and you know this one guy is watching doing hydroponic tomatoes and his tomatoes came out super sweet like wow these are so flavorful and so sweet and it's because he was using a high quality nutrient that had all the nutrients that the plant needed in it you know when he's grown hydroponically so yeah as long as you're using a quality nutrient that has everything you need in it your foods gonna taste awesome just like you know home growing food outdoors and an organic so I recommend maybe do a blind test you can do this yourself actually so grow a couple tomatoes or whatever you like to grow do a few my organic method way or your organic method doesn't matter and then do a few with with sack of flour nutrients the way that I teach to grow marijuana and when you do the cycle flour nutrients be sure to use something like the rock dust and liquid seaweed on top of it or a little bit of c90 like once a week or something to add those trace minerals in there and also make sure to use down-to-earth sorry my brain fart here use the down-to-earth root zone so you get all the micronutrient all the microorganisms in there and then a feed sugar like once a week like about teaspoon 4 right 4 / 5 gallons of water something like that you really can't do too much so like if you have 3 gallons of water you can still do a teaspoon other than perfect if you don't want to do the math whatever obviously with 2 and Afghans will be half a teaspoon but one gallon would be like you just do like a quarter teaspoon or happy it doesn't matter it's not really gonna hurt it if you do a half teaspoon yeah so you're just wasting wasting little bit of sugar sugar super cheap anyway and you can use this regular organic sugar like you can use organic white sugar organic brown sugar you can use molasses you know it doesn't matter it's all the same stuff just carbohydrates that's what that's what they need and yeah so try try both of those and then how you do the blind test since you're the one who grew it is you have to have someone you have to have someone pick the different fruit for you that you grew or whatever whatever you grew and then have you have have you can't see the fruit they'll cut it up for you and then they'll feed it to you or whatever or they'll cut it up and then you blindfolded you have to eat you know pick which one you want to eat and you have to try to tell the difference between the two you have to try to pick out which one's organic if you can't pick out which ones organic then obviously there's really not much of a difference is there because you can't taste the difference because you can't even you can't you can't pinpoint which is which and yeah so that's that and keep in mind when you know you go to a grocery store they're growing that stuff with the minimal effort minimal like they're not even get all the nutrients to plants needs it's just enough to make it grow good and fast and hormones and stuff like that so when you grow your own hydroponically you're using my coco method trust me the food comes out awesome and so in the only way you're into that for yourself is to try it and then you can if you really want to go the extra mile you have the money take each sample down to a place to have them test each one for how much nutrients are in there it's really not that expensive to get a test like that done they'll tell you to do a breakdown of your food and tell you like what's all in it and how much is in there and as long as it's the same strain everything you did it from clones or something like that you're gonna see that you might you might be surprised at that or the hydroponically grown synthetic one might actually have more of everything in it yes so that's that and just make sure to do a good flush on it you know that's important my

at the time the lack of the proper machinery and the lack of someone who can produce it sometimes with our industry it's one of those things if you want the right thing you got to make it yourself [Music] the first tumble I try really hard not to beat up the material because it's lead to key Keef to rosin looking through the side of the machine and as soon as you start to see the hairs and a lot of green then you got a cut it [Music] I can look at it if the heads are big and they're shiny they're like diamonds they'll reflects light even if it has these big green specks if it's still shiny then it'll press better than like something that's super blond with no colored contaminant because the oil in the big heads is what we're going after it's been a really integral part of my life my entire life since like sixth grade back then it was like you got to take it into your own hands if you're doing it yourself and you can't go to a store and buy what you need we make Matic heat presses that are designed around the process of extracting rosin most of the plant matter has been taken out of the active component of the plant and so the smoke is a lot cleaner and a lot stronger the overall focus of our system is just to make sure that the end product is the highest quality possible-- [Music] [Music] Rasen compared to some of the other products as far as concentrates on the shelf I would say has an advantage one because it's it's a completely solvent less technique 2 because it gets a good snapshot as far as the terpene profile of the original genetics that it came from

We are revealing ghost train haze It is an 8020 indica hybrid or sativa hybrid. Let me rephrase And a very good tasting one So give me just a moment and we will share So quiet did you This is the last one and we will get this going And last but not least And now we're gonna go live on Instagram on this phone and we will get this going this has been fun How is everybody today what are we smoking on anything good anything new? So today we are smoking on ghost train haze here. This is what it looks like see how beautiful gold and clear Hey Shannon, O'Brien. Why are you doing today? Darlin? hello had my Phone open to YouTube inside you were gone live. Awesome. Well, it is great to see you We are here. So I have my email here with me today So we don't have to eat anything out, but I'll I'll be ready to go. So this is gonna be kind of a quick review Long as my email will keep back up I burned the email cord a while back and now we have to position it just right to even to work So I need to go online and order a new high five cord So right now we have the I have the nail set at 800 degrees let's go ahead and give her a shot. What do you guys say? So I'm gonna pull off a small piece here Pull her down as always guys fuck cancer Oh, yes, yes Yes So she has kind of a burnt or a decently burn with a very sweet berry flavor to her It's really yummy So let's go ahead and start this ghost Trinis is an 80/20 innocent Eva hybrid. It comes from ghost OG and never Neville's wreck Making from Arizona organics. This has a 27 percent THC Level now when I did when I first did the research on this particular strain I thought it was really funny or really cool how they Really told a little bit more about this. So I'm quoting Alba calm here when it says it's one of the most intense strains that has ever been introduced to the marijuana world Most potent strain on earth says High Times magazine in 2012 The effects of this are cerebral creative energizing euphoria focused giggly happy and uplifted medicinally to treat arthritis chronic pain depression fatigue inflammation migraines and stress The negatives of this dry mouth their eyes there really isn't too many negatives Which was really kind of nice about this go ahead and show you my book I went ahead and decorated this one page of the book With some leaves that I had and I just thought they were really cute. So I put them up there but Just something different to kind of play with because I like I like to make my journal a little bit more colorful and flashy It's just what are those things? I like to do So sorry about that. Let me get to my questions VW I am feeling better today. I'm friendly I don't have the pain from the Gallbladder surgery anymore, which is amazing. I love that. So and it's actually a pretty good day I started out with a pain level of about 8, my bladder is spasming quite a bit today. So it's kind of bothering me This is my Second dab this morning, I think about it This is my second dab this morning and I want to say that I have more energy and I feel like I could get up and do something I just don't know but But I am hey Michelle, how you doing cake bomb that sounds yummy so yeah overall This does help will reduce the pain not as much as an indica strain mostly in Turkish trains do a lot better with the pain For me, I don't know. How do you guys feel this? Do you guys have a preference when it comes to pain management on indica or sativa? Throw it down in the comments below because I am curious if you guys find any of that I've talked to people that have said that are like me that say that they don't use a lot of sativas because it makes them more hyper And so I've heard that but I'm curious Do you guys prefer? indica to city but when it comes to pain management and why throw it down comments below because I'm curious and this is something that You know, I love my indicas. I don't believe you there Michele. I I'm I'm more indica, too And my other half is more sativa. So I mean that everybody's a little bit different. We all have our own preferences Shannon O'Brien fans I'm sure glad you're recovering from the gallbladder surgery Yeah, you know that was it was a gallbladder surgery You would think that the history to me would have been worse than the gallbladder surgery But for some stupid reason I wasn't allowed moving with the gallbladder surgery than I was the hysterectomy So I thought that was kind of funny. So let's go ahead and do one more dab of this We are going to go ahead and push this up just a little bit so we can get a little bit more of a higher Hot and heavy So we can get a really good effect about this. So, let's see So I'm going to move this up to 867 and let it heat up and then we're gonna go from there And we're gonna try this I do find that when I'm in a lot more pain the cotton hurtful dabs will cut that pain a lot better It just it really depends on where that pain level is at so sorry, I have to actually get up and answer on this one because I'm not used to having Instagram down below I never do it and I'm like You know something I really need to build my Instagram account, so I decided to pull it this way, so We shall see so my nail is now heated up. I'm going to take a nice little dab And see how we're feeling as always guys fuck cancer So that one was a bit heavier that one I did get more of a citrusy grapefruit taste out of You can still taste the diesel in it The hotter and the hot the hot and hurtful ones really hit your throat So the back of your throat will be really sore. Mine is right now Yes, I have my dr. Pepper today so yeah overall really good as soon as I can get through this part of it Most people cough and it has it helps that hi hit a little bit faster But with this one, I'm feeling it start to hit right in the middle of my forehead like right between the eyes It's kind of a nice comfortable relaxing hit My throat however, it's really it's still pretty sore You can feel that You can feel the body relaxation start to hit so you'll start getting warmer It's like a warm blanket that gets put around you and you start feeling a little bit better I can feel that the pain level is dropping right now in my bladder starting to relax So this is one that's good for muscle tension But I find that the indicas do better with that muscle tension in all of that stuff so It really just depends on on your preferences Sativas, Michelle says that he was triggered her anxiety. I have heard that too. I had talked to a budtender Awhile about a year ago And we were talking about sativas and he said the same thing is that he gets really anxious with it his heart rate goes up and gets shaky and he feels like he's going to be sick and So he stays away from a heavy and heavy sativa And he does more of the the hybrids the indica hybrids that have that indica to help relax you so it's it's kind of cool So overall, yeah, you can feel it start to relax I feel like I could get up and do something So you do get kind of an energy boost with it, which is really nice. So overall it's a great So overall, very very nice. Thank you Arizona organics BW says Are all your doctors okay with cannabis all of my doctors know that I use cannabis all of them Um your face my primary care doctor is thrilled that I use cannabis He loves it my other doctors, they won't say yes or no either way But they kind of give the hint that it's okay in their book, but they feel like they just can't say it. I don't know When I went to the University Hospital, they said that they have nothing against cannabis They just can't write a script or anything like that for that and I'm like, yeah, I know I know how it works So yeah, it is Most doctors nowadays that I'm running into they ask you if you have your medical marijuana card They'll see you if you show it to them most of the time. They're really cool about it I was really more nervous about this like high interest finding out that I was using Cannabis than anybody because a lot of times they throw the biggest hissy fits And she told me flat out. She's like I'm cold cannabis. You can use that all you want to so yeah, most of I haven't I haven't run into any issues with my doctor's just flat-out refusing now I have run into doctors in the hospital That have gotten very very upset with me for using cannabis, you know, and they'll try to this old Advocacy thing to try to say don't use cannabis because it's bad for you and that kind of thing so I have run into doctors, but my personal doctors Know they they don't say anything really one way or the other except my primary care who's he's all about that. So, yeah Shannon Oprah and I Alma I use almost all high CBD strains working up to higher THC I've gotten so dizzy and hung over from indicas and sativas Oh Then you're doing you're doing these the perfect thing moving to the higher level of CVD or even just adding a CBD On top of using that cannabis will help out a lot. What happens is if if you get too high or you get to euphoric with the cannabis that you're smoking if you um Hey you good yes, I'm good Sorry most of the time if you take an ad like a CBD tincture or a CBD cookie or something with CBD in it? You can get that that euphoria will calm down So it will take the effects a CBD will take the effects of that candidate of that THC away from if that's what you're looking for And I if you're ever looking for a company that does CBD at decent prices I do know of one and I will make sure to put that information in the comments below so you guys can have it if You want to the products from what I understand are really really good I didn't get to look at the testing as of yet But I will definitely look at that before I put the link up because that's my big thing is Quality over quantity. I want to see those tests and think about those tests so That's the only that's the only thing I say right now is that I haven't actually looked at them So but I will look at them and let everybody know so We live in New Jersey But surgery was in Pennsylvania Wow, why'd you have to go to Pennsylvania for the surgery right so far? I had mine made minor surgical procedure Monday the doctors were cool with it I didn't have any for eight hours plus before the procedure Yeah a lot of times that's what the doctors will say before any procedure is that they want you to stay off of cannabis for at Least 24 hours before you go into surgery As I've always told you guys. I'm going to be very very honest with you I have smoked cannabis up until the time. I walked into a hospital to check in for Surgery, I there has never been a reaction I've never had an issue but it is it I do tell you guys to be advised that it can be dangerous Don't do it. Do it the doctors saying we've been 24 hours simply because your health and safety is the most important thing so Yeah So, why did you have to go so far for the surgery and what type of surgery wasn't wasn't? That's what I'm curious about so yeah Always make sure you know anytime you're going into the hospital or even to your doctor's office or Taking medications or doing any of these things If you're using canvas on top of that I recommend that you talk to your doctors But most doctors today are pretty cool about it. If your doctors not cool about it and you feel that You want a second opinion? That is completely your right and how you have every I Encourage you to do it. I mean, you know your health care provider is there to work for you? You're not there to work for your provider. So But I do recommend listening to your provider, please My urologist is a specialist in IC and she's in Pennsylvania. Oh, yeah, never cystoscopy, okay yeah, that's what I did on Monday is I had to go in for a bladder test for my IC and They did this as fast could be right there in the office And I'll tell you what, it was. Absolutely horrible I it's the urethra is so painful and when you have to have that that Catheter put in and have the camera done and you're awake. It just it sucks One thing I can tell you is it's very very quick. So and I'm glad that you're seeing a specialist for your IC I have been I've suffered from this disease for 20 years. I Have this is the first time I have been I've had the opportunity to go to the University Hospital in case I didn't even know that they specialized and I didn't do all of the research I Listened to my doctor because he was one of the best in our area And then he said I was out of his scope and sent me to the University So I understand I have to drive for mine as well But yeah, I had to have that cystoscopy while I was awake and I oh my god So, yeah, but yeah Stay on those meds I can tell you that I have not run into any bladder medications whatsoever that has ever interacted with cannabis cannabis, so you should be good and I've taken I've even taken them with RSO. So the higher doses of cannabis so You should be fine If you can get that RSO though, I can tell you that it does help a lot with the pain of I see that that pain that's associated with I see is just horrendous and I'm getting to the point where it will stop me in my tracks and I'm oh and I that's you know even make some noise anymore because it Surprises me and it just doesn't so quickly. Is it each what do you do, you know? I've looked in New Jersey and tried a doctor near us that claim to know I see Train, right, right. Yeah I heard Mike the first doctor that that that diagnosed me with I see was my OBGYN and He's the one that said, ok. It's time to start seeing you up a Urologist, so I started seeing the urologist and would never went back basically because he had retired so he was actually the head of one of the hospitals for I see And he was he was a teacher. He was really cool, but When he retired nobody understood I see the way that he did The only problem that I had with him is that he had me on high really high doses of Elmer on and diazepam So and that was tough you Do Michelle asked do you make your own RSO with Everclear? Yes, I do. I actually do it two different ways I have a friend that has a still and he has a Medical Distal n't I guess I'm like, what would you call this? It's like Everclear, but it's called FB It's really expensive. So that's why yes is still so that way he can just recycle that So but I go over to his house and we'll do that. He's he's a great guy. He has he's another cancer patient He's prostate cancer. So that's That's how we make our RS. So we kind of team up and help each other, which is really cool. That's one thing I really really love about the stoner community that I have found is that Everybody stays really tight-knit and it's once you're into that little group it Everybody helps one another and it's pretty cool. But Trying to get into it is hard So awesome Drinking hmm Oh Shadow right. She had me do a bladder diary Claimed my only problem was draining too much water 3-letter liters a day awesome drinking drinking Wow, I have to stay at a gallon of water a day in order to make things work with the IC so I mean I will Boid anywhere from four to eight hundred Cc's of urine at a time So nose eyes I can't see that as being an issue As long as you're able to drain the biggest problem with the eye sees that you can't drain Everything and that leads to massive bladder infections all the time I'm to the point now to where I can't tell if it's this tightness that's acting up or if it's a bladder infection any forum Requests to be in your live video So I am Not sure I I can't see the voiding part of it As long as your voiding the appropriate, I mean as long as you're avoiding, that's the biggest issue You have to make sure that you're avoiding all the way and that was my issue is that my bladder stopped voiding can put her stopped voiding little by little so I had to catheterize Because when I was when I would go to the bathroom before I went to bed, I didn't drain all the way so when I went to bed I'd end up getting a bladder infection over and over and over again, so I was on an IV antibiotics all the time to try to prevent that from happening and so I'm still on that but as the Bladder has gone through it's decided less and less urine can can pass through so you have to catheterize Otherwise you have major issues and you're going to get infections and your it's going to lead to kidney problems I see is a nasty bugger it hurts like hell it's it can lead to a lot of different things and it lasts for a long time and it Tortures people and then they have to go in and look and make sure everything's okay And in doing that it causes a lot more pain, so it's kind of this this never-ending cycle So So she finally agreed to give me bladder installations I'm assuming that's what the owner on in it because that's what you should be doing. It's a Saline with the the elomar on in there or well, it's there capsules You open them up and you pour it in and they put that into the bladder or they put a catheter up and then still that in the bladder you hold that into your bladder for at least 30 minutes let It you know, let it do what it's got to do inside the bladder and then you can go to the bathroom again When two more weeks later when I was in physical tears first time crying in public it's Yeah, it's what happens it's Your bladder seems to affect everything When your bladder is? Pissed and that's basically what I call it you get nauseous you get six years and you know, you get nauseous you'll start vomiting You want to scream you want to break something? But you know that it's not gonna help you want something that can make it go away But you know that taking, you know, even if you take an or anything by mouth It's it's gonna go away on its own before that medicine ever Kicks in and that's the biggest problem and we know that that's gonna happen So we try to get in front of it and take the medicine, you know Take something that would pay for pain before that starts hitting so it's not so bad and that's kind of the point where I've been for the last you know while is that I feel like cuz when I went to the doctor when they did the bladder study Monday, they said that my capacity has dropped and The sensitivity has obviously raised and so he's maxing me out on all of the meds to see if he can get this to reverse Because we're I'm a tricky case because most of the time people with I see when they coffer when they Sneeze or when they laugh too much or something like that It causes you to leak a little bit. So they usually have to wear pads. I had do not have to have problem whatsoever I don't leak I don't go. It's one of those things that it's I don't do that anymore so I'm lucky in that aspect, but Because I'm on this edge and we can't figure out how to pull it back that's where we're stuck so that's why I got sent to the University Hospital My comment, there we go. So sorry about the misspelling I meant to put drinking. Oh, no, that's fun She thought that my pain was from bladder stretching out from drinking three one three liters a day No um, I Have had my bladder too. I mean, I've been to the point where I couldn't go to the bathroom to the tea I mean I let they had to catheterize me and I was at Over a thousand cc's that I had voided when they catheterized me in the hospital because I couldn't the catheter stopped working and that that's That's a problem But unless you're over Oversized and three liters is not gonna do that Sorry Unless you're drinking three liters all at one time But I can't see you doing that. You'd end up throwing up the water So it mean if you're drinking three liters water throughout the day and then you're going to the bathroom That's actually a little you should be drinking more water you should be drinking up to a gallon of water a day when you have I see the reason why is because every time you get that bladder to start functioning the better off it is it's cleaning itself out and that pain will will Will get better or so. And that's one of the things that they tell you is don't get dehydrated and stick to the icy diet Because if you don't and you get dehydrated and you're off that icy diet You're gonna get some serious burning in some serious pain coming out of that and your bladder is gonna get really really pissed off and it's gonna start a ripple effect and it starts at the bottom of the bladder and it just pulsates and ripples all the way to the top and it hurts like hell and you can feel it and you can feel Every little ripple that that bladder does because you have to go to the bathroom and you do have nothing in there So your bladder is gonna get really really irritated So when I started this whole thing about 20 years ago, and if you do your research online The more water that you drink the better off you are because you're forcing that bladder to function properly So I knew better yeah Water is now if you're drinking three liters of soda a day. That's a problem. You need water So let's make sure that we do that distinction Because I do drink soda every can of soda I drink I should drink two bottles of water or two eight ounce glasses of water or something like that Because you want that functioning in your bladder. You don't want that especially caffeine and That's One of my downfalls right now is I know how to when my bladder is pissed off I know how to manipulate it a little bit and if I drink some caffeine it does help So I kind of use that in my advantage and I shouldn't but I do But I do make sure I drink a lot of water. So and water is very very very important So I had an appointment with my old doctor in Pennsylvania, but the appointment was three months waiting. It's it's hard People more more doctors are studying and learning about I see and learning the interstitial cystitis is Not in our heads and it's a serious issue. So More and more doctors are looking at this with curiosity and going why what's going on now? We believe that my Icee was caused from radiation from What I was going to cancer treatment, so that's what we believe mine was caused by But it can be caused by a whole bunch of different things. So You might have if he's a good doctor you might have to wait that three months to get in to see him Do your research on the doctors see how great they are if they have great reviews like the University of Arizona They've been you know written up several times. They've got a great reputation I mean there's they had their on the cutting edge of science with all of this. So it's a big deal for them So that's why I you know chose to go there And I did have to wait the first time to get in after that it wasn't quite so bad so so like now I have to go back in a month that type of a thing and we just a word we're monitoring because we know that I'm moving to the next step so Sometimes I'm sorry to say it. We have to bite that bullet and we have to wait if the doctor is worth waiting for so just like You know when I was in and we talked to my doctor on on Monday, he had asked me questions about Botox injections And I'm like, yeah, I've had them and yeah, they do kind of work for a little while. It's not too bad but It only lasts about two months. And is it really worth coming in? Every two months having to go into surgery having them do the bladder expansion having him Do you know the shots in into the the bladder the Botox into there? Is it really worth doing that for you know it dimension a diminishing amount of time? So that's really what you have to look at is, you know? Weigh your options see how it is. If the doctor is worth waiting about three months. I recommend waiting it And I know that that sucks I've been doing so well Hey, Missy, how you doing? You're at the gym now. Have a great day, sweetie That's cute. I'd been doing so well I hadn't seen her in three D plus years and now a new patient employment. Yeah When I first started this disease, I went back and forth I mean I was on a full-time Foley for a little while and it sucked You saw because I was bleeding so much I had so much blood that they had to keep me on a catheter get keep that blood and keep that nastiness out of there And that infection out of there and then I had to force all these liquids and they had an IV going and it was huge thing So And then all of a sudden I I we don't even know what happened and I started doing really good And I didn't see my doctor for you know a few years and I to do the same thing If the doctors worth it wait, I hate saying that but if the doctor is worth it, you kind of just have to You know weigh your options and so, you know, it sucks. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I Didn't do we w asked if I liked my Tucson doctor I do doctor twist is a really good doctor. I Really do like him He's been real patient. He talks me through. He tells me what he's going to do And if he apologizes for causing pain when he shouldn't need to apologize because it's not his fault He has to do his test. So yeah, I mean I really do they're they're real patient They're real nice, even the the nursing staff and everybody that they're there are just really awesome people So Happy hump day partly cloudy. How you doing? Oh So you're gonna have to make another appointment to see him I would get on that as soon as possible if he's worth it, yeah Maybe you know, I would get a second opinion. It's always a good thing if you feel that your doctor isn't Versed enough in what's going on with you? You always have that right to get a second opinion and I really suggested I do find with the I see however that the indica strains do better With the pain and the discomfort and all of that just so you know From a local okay. So what way da got infusions from a local doctor? Oh I am doing pretty good today Thank you for asking So let's do one small dab. My pain level has dropped now To about us s six uncomfortable We're just gonna bring up an up. He's here Cuz we've been on here and we're gonna do our exit strategy here so I can go inside and start relaxing So as always guys what cancer?

tech 3000 press machine three hundred dollars or so was on Amazon thousand pounds of pressure great a little clean well worth it I'm gonna load three of the bubble hash pieces into the micron bag I want to leave maybe a half inch or so cushion around the sides of it then she I'll push it together so that it stays together in a nice group and it's level so that all presses approximately even leave it through the heat press but then I want to cut off part of the bag so that when I fold it over I have about all three quarters of an inch or so on the other side as well to make it even but secure enough so that the bag doesn't blow out I've cut the bag and now I'm gonna fold it over and I'm gonna use for glues some of the dads the older dads on the tip of a toothpick as the glue as I fold the bag over to keep it together and it just reuses it as it heats up it melts with everything else I'd like to do a double fold I'll do a little short fold-over first then I'll apply the dabs as the glue and fold it over again to make sure I have a good seal on this end so again nothing blows out the side all right we got that sealed up nice now I'll get my parchment paper and get ready to place this in between the heat pads once they're warmed up and ready to go all right starting it up it's pre-programmed already I'm gonna go like about 185 183 is my temperature and about 95 seconds or so for my time again this is a thousand pounds press but when I first press it I'll be going very slowly to make sure none of the material gets pressed out too hard too fast before it's actually melted just wanted to know gotta fold this parchment paper in half make sure the shiny side is on the inside and then I'll place my rosin bag inside and ready to place in between the heat press once it's completely warmed up alright and we are ready to close then fold I once it starts at the time again this I have not engaged it fully I'm just partially pressing down pressing a little bit harder I like to push it down and slowly as you see the timer counting down right now two minutes or so so I start a little bit more maybe like two ten and then finally once it's ready hit lock as I push it all the way down and then we'll just wait for the timer to ring and collect our goodies I like to use the ice pack or cold pack under the screen that they provided or the silicone mat that they provide and the tools that they provide and it helps cool the rosin down as it comes out of the press at such a high temperature easier to scrape it off the parchment paper alright that piercing sound tells it let's be ready gonna lift up and see the rosin he didn't drained out of the bag gonna carefully remove it remember these plates are extremely hot so be careful as I take it out and place it onto the cold mat spit that off then one is ready I'll slowly carefully peel this bag off I'll put it in another parchment paper and hook it back up and let it run a second time while I scraped the first one well you ready to scrape I'll put the next one through again same one out of time see if when you just get a little bit more out of it I'll use the silicone container so other scape the rosin out put stores nicely inside there then comes out nicely this point it's beautiful beside that scrape it up all right first time through nice little amount now what will happen is as I seal this and let it sit for another 1224 hours that will melt down and become a really nice orderly looking mixture like this this is from the last batch this is now of the same bag second time through the press and we got a nice amount of additional rosin to be able to harvest put it into our container from those three pieces of bubble hash from our trim and there's a harvest of rosin starting to slowly melt a little bit as it gets to room temperature just drops all the way down to the bottom in a container but there'd be a lot of nice Dappy at side of that", "61XshY_UG_k": "we're back at day 35 mojiko strain is number one roughly halfway through the flowering cycle and as you can see is putting a serious way", "N3vDm9HXWOU": "welcome back to turkey eyes in today's episode we're going to be pressing one ounce of fresh frozen full plan ice water hash we get big yields using the directional flow method as well as show you how I butter the rosin after being pressed [Music] let's go over the items we're going to be using during this week's episode we're going to need parchment paper any brand will do I always go with the unbleached version pressing bags I ordered these online in a custom size to fit my pressing plates perfectly allowing me to maximize the amount that can be pressed at a single time as for micron science I go with the 37 micron because I mainly deal with ice water hash or teeth if you're going to be pressing flour but with ninety micron and I always remember to double bag your product a couple Dobb tools and a set of tweezers lastly obviously the material I'll be pressing you already know from the title we're going to be doing a single press of one ounce the material I'll be pressing is fresh frozen ice water hash this was from one of my previous grows it's a blend of green crack barber bud and Harley Quinn bx4 this is also material that's been freeze-dried I'll be doing a video shortly covering how I made the ice water hash and using my freeze dryer so be sure to hit that subscribe button you can notified when that gets posted as you can see the material is getting pretty sticky once it comes out of the fridge making it very difficult to talk the pressing baked properly [Music] using one of my job tools I packed though ice-water house down into the bag as evenly as possible my hand I give it a good pre-press evening out the material as best as I can at this point the ice water hash has already become warm and it's very sticky not allowing it to be moved around much in the bag [Music] for today's press we're going to be utilizing the directional flow method a benefit of using it is that it allows you to watch the flow during the press you can see the flow from start to finish allowing you to adjust the variables accordingly this becomes very helpful at all stages as you're about to see I forgot to double bag my material which resulted in my bag being unfolded squishing out the ice water hash out the one end this became noticeable immediately allowing me to stop the press right away unfortunately I forgot to record me collecting the material and just putting a second bag over the other [Music] [Music] I stopped the first pressed short not noticing the flow of the rosin still happening [Music] I then folded the pressing bag in half and did a second press giving additional amount of yield [Music] letting the freshly pressed live hash rasa sit for a few minutes allow it to cool carving the rosin eyelet cooler temperature helps with a collection of it using a long-handled dab tool makes the collection of the rosin very easy since the second press was very short I'm going to collect all the rosin together after collecting it all into one patty I like to put it into a glass jar it's process butters the rosin to texture I find more appealing [Music] I simply put the glass shard in between the two plates with the lid tightly screwed on and let it sit for about one hour at 150 degrees Fahrenheit then I open the jar stir the rose and whip it around mix it up place it back in between the plates I had a hundred degrees Fahrenheit for ten hours after the ten hours I collect the rosin out of the jar and place it into a storage container if you enjoyed this video don't forget to hit that like button [Music]", "PX3c1o3bvW8": "yo yo yo what's good you guys welcome to a live stream we're gonna go ahead and do uh the rest of the presses from yesterday that i didn't finish it up got uh six bucks here we're gonna go ahead and start pressing these um i'm thinking at 200. yesterday we did a range of temperatures the lower temperatures were not cutting it so we're going to go back to our our higher tip that i like to do that 202 we're gonna go ahead and uh we'll see how that does got some more parchment so i got the uh pucks properly wrapped up now and prepped in the appropriate size parchment sleeves so we should be able to get a decent flow and we'll just have to see what we get and we'll adjust the temperature as needed i don't imagine we'll be going down below 190 so excuse me one minute while i go ahead and finish straightening some [ __ ] up it is [ __ ] chilly chilly really really really [ __ ] is cold in the [ __ ] whoa i honestly i'm about to put on my [ __ ] key hold on yeah burr yeah we bout to take a dab right now hell yeah seeking something i'm glad to hear that man that's dope get your press on so here's the jar that we started last night this stuff was super turpy so we got all these crazy dark terps in here and we've got this lighter area and we're going to go ahead and we're going to mix all of it together today trim run gelato cake and white runs it's a little darker but oh my god i am in love with the taste already the taste on it is like a mint chocolate chip coffee it's bananas not the flavor but just it's crazy i haven't done any like stirring whipping i haven't done anything to it since last night i'm curious to see what it's going to do over the next couple days oh man and it melts so clean like you wouldn't even believe with how dark it is how clean it melts i'm gonna show you guys [Music] oh yeah that works in this life so clean we

to say like uh the team is strong like big up to the team [Music] am i am i right we just started working at amazon working overnights that means you're packing [ __ ] women's dildo orders and [ __ ]

[Music] [Music] my man said he's part of the ginyu force that's what he said until we figure out what he's saying we're just gonna assume that he's saying he's part of the ginyu force [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] foreign oh this one gets loud oh so good return puck feels uh pretty well emptied and got off the plates pretty quick and was the same color or lighter than yesterday a slightly better return feels like so i dropped the temperature a little bit but not much because this stuff does just come out darker because in the terps [Music] so i still want to keep the flow high [Music] myself [Music] uh wow i'm allowed to give you guys information soon but i can't give you information on pricing yet i was told i have to wait until science led makes the official announcement and gets them on their site and then by then they'll have like um shipping times and you'll be able to pre-order and [ __ ] they don't want to put out the information too soon so they told me to wait trust me i'm i'm so ready to tell you guys [Music] you know [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm at uh 190 right now it's just looking off because the lighting is [ __ ] and this is a trim run bro here maybe this will help you guys with the color issue i know it's hard to tell but you'll see you'll see get this in the jar and then we're going to go ahead and start the next puck that was a good temperature and we're gonna run it at that time yeah i don't really have a good spot you guys where you're not gonna be in the [ __ ] way i'll try and move you over a little bit i think my laptop could be [ __ ] maybe let me see food grade month okay you guys if you say so you know what determines whether it's food grade or not how clean it melts when i show you how clean it melts you're gonna be like oh okay yeah that's not food grade the trichomes that come off of trim is usually going to be more mature because it's exposed to more direct light than the rest of the trichomes that are covered in the plant matter right so when you process trim it's going to come out slightly more amber too all right and then if you're dealing with a strain that's really really terpy and depending on what those terpenes are can also make it darker right so never judge judge it by the color alone and be quick to say oh that's food grade or that's not good like it's really really hard to judge it based off of color alone especially fresh off the press so oh yeah definitely people judge with their eyes first for sure you eat with your eyes first you judge off of appearance first but again this is fresh off the plates and you got to give me a couple days and work my magic on it telling you guys i'm telling you huh i want to mention just my lighting is [ __ ] probably back you guys the [ __ ] up huh um the plan is going to be to whip this all up and heat mat it and then burp it at um at a certain point [Music] so good extraction on that one too this is going to turn out just like the los altos did it's gonna turn into that like jam with chunks in it and i'm gonna love it we'll love every minute of it there's not good light over here where's the best light for me let's go in here oh no [ __ ] that room goes crazy let's try right here man the light [ __ ] right now there we go how's that color looking it looks like [ __ ] when you look at it from the top because the camera can't perceive the light the same way but it's just terpius [ __ ] so and you would think oh the lower temperature you go the lighter it'll be no because it just takes too long to get off the plates and we already tried 200 that was too hot then 190 is is the sweet spot it's the best it's gonna get for uh for this i mean i can go like 155 160 and press like five grams at a time maybe get a different result but i'm not pressing five [ __ ] grams at a time that's not what's gonna happen today i wonder if it would help so this is gonna get real silly if i don't put you guys down soon oh this is between 16 to 22 grams in every one of these bags how did you already know right my man saw the board behind me and added it up already my press is feminine thank you her name is bertha so yes she is feminine it's not the craziest smell actually because i'm not running it too hot but it's like a minty coffee lag oh there's some fat ass chunks in this hmm two more oh my goodness we always gotta get one or two huh you know actually i think that you've been on this channel being done before you are the weakest link bye [Music] [Music] i don't know yet my yield on this run yet because we're in the middle of doing it right now i'm not trying to be a smart ass but open your eyes [Music] how old is the material it was a couple weeks old when it was given to me about two weeks old i want to say sat in the freezer for a couple weeks i don't know if uh what the yield has been i haven't really been weighing anything yet so i'll just wait and see i'll wait and find out at the end and i get a veggie burger with uh grilled onions no tomato with fries with uh spread i mean i put my own beyond meat burger patty on it when i get home still enjoy in and out but do it the vegan way yeah buddy but also whoever did mention edibles for food grade i am going to turn a good portion of my cut into edibles or at least caps really potent caps rosin gaps no i didn't do anything today i'm working working working working working and uh somebody else says one more and then collection and then we're going to stir it all up and get it going on the heat map i'm gonna heat mat it at least overnight i'll show you guys i have no secrets no secrets whatsoever i don't time anything i don't look at the gauge anything if i don't know who you are on the gram or if you don't follow or like somebody i know doesn't follow you then i don't accept you you got to tell me what your name is so that i can go and accept you and maybe maybe if i've seen your name around here enough i'll accept it otherwise you gotta know somebody to know somebody to know somebody to know somebody to know somebody so yeah there i'm gonna start doing a lot more live sessions that are gonna be more interactive i'm gonna set up uh a streaming session in the new hash set so it'll be a good stable connection and we'll be able to have some proper lighting in there our windows uh vented sunlight and we'll be able to have some real good sessions okay so so yo i watched this uh hugh hefner docu-series with my wife and it was actually pretty interesting i didn't know that he was so involved in social issues it was really interesting to see that and how he went against the grain with racism and segregation and he would invite um all these black stars to come onto his show right and he had aretha franklin and um brain farting on the other person and but he had like a bunch of different up and coming artists and he wasn't afraid to have them come and perform at his club because he didn't care he didn't see color he just saw talent and he wanted to make it known what his company stood for and didn't stand for and so he interviewed like he did really really in-depth interviews with a lot of celebrities and at one point he did an in-depth interview with malcolm x and malcolm x was you know saying his typical stuff very radical extremist stuff and mind you majority of the readers of playboy back at this time are white and he published it against the advice of all the other people that were working for and he published it unedited and well not unedited like they edited it but they didn't like edit his answers or change his wording they left it all exactly how he said it you know um and i'm like yo that that's [ __ ] ballsy and he got a lot of support for it actually afterwards and a lot of readers wrote in and said that was awesome thanks for sharing that interview blah blah blah so yeah man that was that was really interesting to watch that and obviously to watch his back and forth with struggling to be um you know married and father and all these different things that he just couldn't [ __ ] do living in the [ __ ] mansion i think any normal man would succumb to that [ __ ] after a while especially after being away from your wife the man was surrounded by titties and ass 24 7. like i think he had so much titties and ass i would get tired of it i would be like [ __ ] put some clothes on like it's not even exciting anymore to see your titties they're just always out like put some clothes on surprise me i want to come around the corner and just be like ah titties surprise it's been three days then i'm gonna be like oh titties but if i see titties every time i walk around the [ __ ] house i'm titties like what like it's like looking at an elbow it's just not gonna matter anymore you know just doesn't [ __ ] matter anymore i don't know how that man stayed excited by i guess maybe there was just so many different kinds of titties i don't know i think i would get over it titty climbing wall bro you know how much i just pictured that [ __ ] on my head like a rock climbing wall but instead of rocks his titties yo oh my god you are creative you are creative that is funny he says my friend has a thing for elbows i mean i'm a classic i'm a classy man i i like exposed shoulders if my wife ever has like a shirt that is like has one of those wide

want to know thongs or booty shorts this is going to tell me everything i need to know about every last one of you from here on out i'm deciding your face as a friend or a foe choose wisely how [ __ ] would you guess cheers man cheers i'm going to show you guys how [ __ ] clear this is too here you", "DX69RotPbvE": "hello YouTube Donald I'm gonna be looking at the moonshine haze today isn't she pretty huh she's bulking up this is the one that I had to flower early so I could separate the girls from the boys and I didn't it didn't have the chance to get big before I followed it but you know she's looking pretty good she's his flowers are bulking up she probably has another six weeks of flowering to go because this is a sativa and they take a long time to fully ripen once they start flowering they can do three months just in flowering in one month and veg vegetative girl so that's a four-month growth for a lot of the sativas and I think this was gonna be any exception it's gonna take a while but she's looking good she's looking good and with another six weeks to go what so she's gonna put on some weight that sounds like me too much cannabis and yes he could she could turn in a few ounces anyway maybe more I'm thinking that if I had allowed this to grow to the size I was normally relative before flowering it would be twice this bit maybe even more so she's coming along nicely and I'm hoping that of those four moonshine haze sprouts that I have grown in a little tent and at least one of them will be a female and I'm gonna grow that one certainly to a good size before I flower it looks like she's gonna turn in a huge yield I'm excited I'm gonna move over to the small tent or cut away and I'll be right back all right so here I am at the germinating count notice if you will the rather explosive vegetative growth in just the past two days since I put the since I put them under the metal halide lamp now halide really kicks ass even this little one here which wasn't what she's starting to show some real healthy welfare look at this see this is where I pruned see right there where I cut the first one it's the first one and then I got four branches know what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna cut these growing tips off right here that's coming off that's coming off right there that one and this one over here so crack at it right now there's one yes to yes for all right that's that's gonna promote some further branching it's gonna keep this this thing nice and short doesn't get too tall but it's just amazing the new the vigorous growth in just two days since I put it in the middle a lot yeah looking good now I have never grown four plants in the same bucket I've done two but not four and again the reason for this is because the seeds were not feminized they're just regular seats you don't know which of the males and which of the females so you really have to take about four seeds and grow them now this is gonna get tricky because they're gonna start crowding each other real soon and I also wanted to show you this where those roots huh you know that nice healthy white root starting to grow out through the basket now so I'm just waiting for the the drying to get done in that tent that I harvested the pineapple chunk in earlier today I hang that the plants inside that Ted zip it up no light has to be done in darkness and I leave the ventilation fan on you know probably take about three four maybe five days to dry out and then I can move these into there and put them I'm gonna land another metal halide lamp in there and and watch them grow watching take off what I'm gonna end up having to do I know already is when these things start crowding each other out is as they get taller I'm gonna have to bend them over I'm gonna have to bend them away from each other pull them away from each other like that but cannabis is very good about that the young especially the sativas the stems can get really pliable look the new growth on the branch tips is a very pliable so it's very easy to to bend it over without snapping it so it's very compliant that way and that's what I'm gonna end up having to do because I want these to get to full size before I flour them and not just flour them right away so I can see the males and the females because if I get a female it's gonna tell turned out like the one in the other tent it's only gonna be a third the size that it should be so it's gonna get crowded in the other tent but I think I can manage it and then soon enough the males will make their appearance and I'll be cutting those down and taking them out so I don't think I'm gonna end up with four males I think statistically I got a you know good shot at getting one female out of these four so however many females I get the other ones if there's any other ones cut wouldn't be something if I got four females oh well I don't want the harvest that would be and I have to let them grow tall enough big enough so that I can take cuttings from them and clone them I don't want to have to go through this whole seed thing again separating the males from the females from the seeds I want to have clones so it's gonna be tricky it's gonna be a little challenging but I think I'll get through it and I think I'll get success so so that's a wrap for tonight with the moonshine haste thanks for watching be sure to LIKE and subscribe I'll see you next time day", "AJAKZt-flk0": "hey everyone today's video is going to be review on color cannabis ghost train haze says it's a low thc uh 14.6 but what i'm noticing is with these government strains their thc is saying it's a lot lower than what it possibly could be i'm an experienced marijuana smoker and um some of their strains said they're low then i want to smoke them and i'm like there's no way it's that low you know there's no way but um let's go ahead and open it it is this is three joints or two joints two this is two joints and they weigh uh zero point three five grams so it's so [ __ ] certain a third of a gram each i'm gonna try to keep everything on camera this time sorry guys so and ladies and gents um there we go i opened her up so there you go you see the two joints in there yeah there you go it smells i'm getting a piney earthy skunky tone a little bit sour a little bit cheesy i'm gonna say like a soury cheesy skunky smell that's what my final thoughts is on the smell um i'll let you know how it is um we're gonna go ahead and smoke one i'll um set the camera back up and i'll let you know how it is now what i'm going to do also is i'm going to show you package dates so this was us packaged september 14 2020. so together we're going to see um we're going to see from the dates and how the flowers affected by the by the timing in the packages but like i said i've had good results with these containers i found when i buy weed from them is usually in the container it's really good thanks for watching i'll uh add the review to the end hey everyone it's tech crazy here uh i'm doing the review on the ghost train haze i'm gonna take a ball with you very very very smooth it's almost like a a skunky cheese taste i i want to say what do you think i'll give him more citrusy yeah light citrusy lemony a little bit of that lemon with that skunky taste look at the history of the strain i bet your lemon is i could literally smoke this whole joint in one bowl and hold it in am i saying i'm not gonna get started i'm not saying it's light weed it's just that smooth it's that smooth this is my first joint of the day like always um all right i had a bunch of stuff to do today i went outside i started cooking dinner i did laundry so like you know i'm pretty clear minded right now if you um if you don't like harsh weeds this is a very nice strain it has uh for flavor for flavor i give it a three out of five um for smoothness is getting a five out of five all day like i'm not joking i can smoke that whole joint in one lung and i will not cough that's how smooth that joint is now i know from history so most hazes take about 20 minutes to get you the haze is a sativa dominant name and like purple haze it's a v very creative um buzz like i might not feel stone but you might see me pop four or five videos up tonight just because i'm smoking this weed this weed will help you think this weed is very relaxing i am relaxed right now i have really bad nerves i have a lot of nerve damage i've had my neck broken my back broken i've been shot stabbed [ __ ] burned you name it i've had it all happen to me and i feel relaxed right now i feel very very relaxed um so i'm going to give silver train haze i'm going to give it a ghost train a story i'm going to give it a 4.2 my friend's giving it a four what did it cost uh you get two of these joints for about nine dollars so we're looking at four dollars and fifty cents for zero point three five so that is really reasonable it's uh more than ten dollars a gram though that's still more than ten dollars a gram this to me is nine dollar gram weed this ain't no ten eleven twelve dollar gram weed this is nine dollars so i i'm dropping the price on that and other than that did you know it's no complaint expensive yeah so they did roll it it's about a nine dollar grant so yeah it's about right my friend just pointed that out to me so you know what i'm going to raise my i'm going to raise my um i'm going to raise my rating to a 4.3 i'm going to give it my friend's giving a 4.1 he doesn't like it as much as i do but i know i'm going to get a lot of [ __ ] done tonight i'm going to make videos this weed is going to keep me uh focused i'm watching ufc i'm cooking dinner i got laundry going no problem i'm it's all getting done i don't have that sativa buzz you know it keeps you going but we got an intercalator go to bed later on we're on an indica for later so thanks for watching we'll talk to you later bye you", "1nDQEqUiV_o": "[Music] hello and welcome back to the cannabis sommelier i'm your host andrew friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of cannabis reviews today we have an awesome product category it's extracts i've only had one extract on the channel i personally love extracts it's mainly what i smoke it's what i'm used to vaporizing from the legacy market something that i hold near and dear to my heart and i'm actually going to show you my live rosin and hash rosin in a coming video from my garden you get to see some of the things that i've made and some of the cannabis i produce and kind of see how i'm holding people accountable to my standard but what do we have today a really cool product uh from an awesome company out on vancouver island from good buds we've got hash rosin and you might be asking yourself andy what's hash rosin well let's take both the words break them down hash being uh seething the glandular head off of cannabis either through a dry sieve or a wet sieve being bubble hash or dry sip i believe this one comes to us from a fresh frozen bubble hash because that's what they have on market right now and what their product card is saying now rosin if you're not familiar with the terminology rosin it's actually the way you can excrete the essential oils from the cannabis flower or hash by only using heat or pressure and then you squish out those essential oils and you leave behind any contaminant that may be there giving you a beautiful dabbable product there isn't very many uh products to dab on market right now so that's why i was excited to see the good buds hash rosin come out and at a reasonable price point this is a half gram and the half gram is 40 that's what i paid for it so not too bad now i see this it was packed on may 6 2020 uh net weight half gram and it's equivalent to two grams of dried canvas not bad at all the smoke from cannabis is harmful there are 800 milligrams of active thc in a full gram of this so 400 milligrams a lot of thc a lot of terps uh all the good things that you're looking for if you are have found that you've built a big tolerance to cannabis and you've never tried an extract before like rawson shatter live resin or even just hash i definitely would recommend uh supercharging everything up you can use these products in different ways today i'm gonna use them in a dab rig because that's the best way for me to assess the flavor but enough talking about it well i think i mentioned good buds is certified organic which is cool uh good buds this is from sun grown cannabis and the company was started out the back of a sprinter van i believe uh growing cannabis and evolved into an entire licensed producer so good for the guys out there for having the business acumen to bring something like this to market and be one of the first movers pretty cool in my opinion i don't know who processed it for them but if i was to make a bet on it i think it was whistler tech here we go let's break the seal underneath this camera and we've got this big package see our cannabis seal all of our good stuff let's get in there hope you're having a wonderful day oh can i get in with my just my thumbnail there we go and then it should be a easy peasy lemon squeezy and there is what's inside of our package which is another child proof container and there is our rosin let's inspect our container no contaminant doesn't look like there's any contaminant it's a little dark but we're not raws and racist here so we're gonna try it it definitely has that crust formed on the top it's been sitting packaged for a couple months now so that's fair um but let's dig in and then we'll start smelling it very soft you can see there buttered underneath that color goes all the way through i kind of like to break this out of here but let's smell it so this is a mixed hash they say that it's a bunch of mixed ones but i know they have lord of the apes and white glucky so i assume it's a mix of those two um on the nose there's like lemon lemon bar a little bit of lemon cream yeah definitely just those confectionary kind of cakey lemon bar aromas creamy sweet cream lemon it's quite simple that's all i'm really pulling out of it at first i had a bit of an aroma skunk but that skunkiness is gone let's see if i can pull this out of there there we go we can get it out pretty easy and uh we can get a little booty shot of our grain or our half gram here so you can see how it waxed up in there you can see the sheen on now that's been opened it's sweating a little so that's pretty cool uh oh no stuck to my finger okay so now most importantly let's taste it uh if you guys aren't used to doing dabs it's a little bit of a process there are more things you are going to need a rig now there's many different options you can use an electronic rig like the g pen rom that heats up and it's you know click of a button it all turns on i have reviews of that um or you can use the traditional rig banger and a torch with a carb cap today i think i'm going to do that since this is hash rosin i want to give it the respect i'm going to put the respect on it um so let's give that a little taste test out of my elbow dyno 2014 very cool check out elbow glass this is one of his original shapes um always wanted this piece very very cool i am using i forget what kind of banger this is and then there's a ruby insert in here we're gonna use the gordo scientific cap this is a blazer big shot torch in case all those things matter to you there's a lot of pieces to this dabbing thing but again as i mentioned vaporizing essential oils is what i uh tend to do the most it's the most time consuming but it's like smoking an entire joint in one puff and that's pretty all right if you ask me so there we go got it hot enough and now we're gonna wait a minute good thing i have a timer up here or else i would completely lose this we'll put that little guy into that bottom shot while we wait for it here well let's do it up here the dino just cooling down super cool love this piece absolutely love this piece um i was really happy actually me and my wife bought it together and we got hooked up through homeless hittings at homeless headies on instagram you should definitely check out homeless headaches if you're looking to get yourself a sick rig at a great price all right that's about our dab temperature and uh cheers okay so pretty good um things that i often look for in a hash rosin uh are that it has no plant matter taste um there wasn't any plant matter taste so that is a good sign and then the motto is there's always going to be a little bit of residual in the banger so you got to waste it to taste it but we're going to want to wipe out what's left over to keep our banger nice and clear we can really get a lot of indications off of the q-tip as well see if there's any contaminant anything like that and to me it uh it melted pretty clean actually um so pretty pretty good um what did i taste though i did try their white glooky's hash and i could taste that kind of wood chippiness come through from um that hash so maybe that's one thing i did take a decent size dab so i was really trying to taste it on the palate i got um i guess a little bit that lemon bar a little bit that sweet cream i definitely got wood chips i tasted a lot of like older hash that maybe had been quite oxidized but the finish is nice and long on my palette not bad at all i think it's a good representation of where the legal market can start and what we can evolve too i think it's probably competing with a lot of things on that legacy market right now maybe not the top top end um but it's not uh it's it's it's not too bad um okay well let's break down the good buds hash rosin from top to bottom how we liked it uh so the appearance it is hash rosin uh we're not rosin racist but i would like a much lighter creamier um more stable less sweaty as soon as i open it product there are a lot of things that uh this could go through to give it a different formulation so on the appearance i guess there's no contaminant the color's rough um we'll give it 15 points i think 15 points is fair for the appearance this is definitely maybe just a year behind where it could be um the smell wasn't too loud as i mentioned it is a simple rosin it had that sweet cream lemon bar kind of buttery lemon bar i don't know not anything insane again 30 points done the taste was good the finish is definitely the best part but when i did get that little bit of wood chippiness that didn't get me too stoked it would just kind of tasted like old hash um just being an absolute hash head i knew what i was tasting um so in that case for the taste i'd like to give it 13 points could have done better didn't taste bad had a nice finish um but the pieces of it that stood out to me i could kind of feel like it might have been i don't want to say faulted but i could i could tell that it wasn't um what it could have been uh overall experience based on my knowledge of cannabis rosin everything about this um it's like a 70 product so let's give it 14 points and that's my total i bet it's about a 70 percent uh hash rosin um ways to go good starting point not overly upset at my purchase for forty dollars and let's play with it once before we go in the camera so you guys can see the butter butter see the sweat mixing up but it is quite sticky and let's give it one last smell no nothing's changed just sweet cream and lemon awesome thanks so much for watching i hope you're gonna dab some extracts i hope you're out there i hope you're gonna move into that new world have you ever dabbed before let me know below let me know if i need to do a dab tutorial or something like that and cover it a little bit more in depth i really appreciate you watching have a great day make sure to like comment share and subscribe cheers guys what's my name what's my name the cannabis somalian", "PWRlTdwZbFY": "the top 10 strains of cannabis as voted for by you our wonderful subscribers [Music] having checked through all the great comments you've been leaving us and to mark our momentous rise to 10 000 subscribers we have created a definitive list of your top 10 favorite cannabis strains we do just have one question to ask though how can you tell how good a cannabis plant will be just from looking at a few of its seeds after all you only look at the seeds don't you that's what you bought them for so we did some research as to why you may have found the seeds of each strain so enticing and decided that it must have been on their potential potential that is if you accidentally happen to drop one of the seeds into a pot of nutrient rich and moist soil that is located in a warm place under a light bulb and that was also located in a well ventilated place so where shall we begin at number 10 on the list you voted for train wreck though starting out with a train wreck may not seem such a smart move especially if you enjoy travel this one's popular because of the powerful high and few negative side effects it seems to have a reputation for generating creativity and many comment that it has helped migraines general pain and arthritis gelato comes in at number nine with a word of caution for the uninitiated as this has a powerful hit physical relaxation seems to be the overarching theme while the ability to still function normally is a definite upside sitting at number eight on the list star dog is a winner with those of you who are looking for a good thc level at around 20 percent you guys seem to feel that this is a good choice for those of you suffering from fatigue stress or anxiety at number seven future one seems to hit the mark with those of you who are looking for something that leaves you feeling seriously relaxed apparently also helping to reduce feelings of depression a few of you mentioned the word chocolate and not just because of an attack of the munchies on to number six we have amnesia haze so how did it get its name maybe because it's high in thc and low in cpd levels the citrusy notes seem to go down well with you as does the boost of energy that gets delivered northern lights seems to be another popular choice with you and enters the list at number five perhaps because of its potential to reduce stress and counteract sleeplessness the slightly lower thc level makes this one more sophorific and more likely to create a feeling of blissfulness we're beginning to detect a theme here as this is another great strain that apparently induces a great feeling of being relaxed and happy rumor has it that this plant will also flower after just 45 days which is pretty quick in our opinion so maybe a good variety for those of you who are impatient girl scout cookies makes it comfortably onto the list at number four thanks to its ability to help users deal with pain while providing a full bodied hit of relaxation and mind-bending euphoria at number three we have gorilla glue also known as gg4 which has won many awards across the globe and has clearly been a big hit with you as well this is one of those highly potent strains that helps to deliver a thumping dose of euphoria and relaxation which will leave you feeling glued to whatever you are sitting or lying on bruce banner is near the top of our list at number two and works quickly with a heavy hit and then settles down into a euphoric and creative buzz it also seems to be popular with daytime users before we move on to the coveted top spot voted for by you it would only be right to mention a few honorable entries sour diesel didn't quite make it on the list but deserves a mention through its ability to make users feel uplifted euphoric and generally happy while still feeling full of energy your comments also indicated potential for helping with stress and depression we also couldn't completely leave out ghost train haze primarily because of the reports of its inducing a strong sense of creativity and ability to still concentrate heavily some of you also mentioned about its possible help with pain and depression but those prone to anxiety should give this one a pass so back to it and the clear winner is wait for it wedding cake an unforgettable journey into the land of delight begins with a single taste of this indica dominant super potent fiend of a strain its family line oozes sweet and sour earthy scents with unmistakable vanilla aromas and old skunky undertones it would seem that this one delivers the strongest high followed by a deep and

"oh good morning good afternoon good evening whatever time of the day it is that you're watching this video before I get started to have a little bit of unfortunate news after reading a couple of things online today it seems like YouTube may be trying to shut down every cannabis-related channel so if I disappear it's not because I wanted to but anyway on to what we actually came here for today's product is one from color cannabis is the first one that I've seen under this name here and of course it is their ghost train haze this was in the sativa Leaney area of NSL C's store today so today we have a package date of May the 8th and today is June the 10th so it's been in there about two months ish so we're hoping that it has a airtight seal on it now unfortunately these guys right away Babbitt box why why do you need a box when you also have a plastic container I don't know but anyway that's them might want to turn this guy on pull this guy out right where he should be excellent I love it that it works right every time okay I should probably pull my cover on too cuz I don't want to have to spill that everything everywhere tear it off and let's see what we have in store for us all right so they do have an airtight seal so that is a good sign the two months may mean absolutely nothing and holy smokes that's difficult to pull and then we need to place this down great go so there's a lot of wasted space and container but not not a whole lot in comparison to some of them will say let's bring one of these right up close definitely looks nice give it a squeeze test it's a little bit of a bounce to it but not a whole lot no dusting which is always a good sign yes I can pull it apart with a couple of fingers but it comes apart into big chunks so probably want to put her in a grinder she won't be too bad she'll definitely turn out pretty nice let's well I've been really pleased lately it seems like most of them have been trying to avoid the shake in the bottom to make up their little bit of weight which is always pleasing I hated to see those like half grams of just pure shake in the bottom this that's all that's left in there no big deal that's cool so with all the buds on to the scale of this ticking three point four three point five dump all that in and she goes up to three point five exactly on the dot no complaints hmm let me think I think I've covered about everything for now let me give us a smell hmm there was a nice kind of lemony hint to it but it's not really strong you really got to smell anything it's kind of like an after smell yeah that's all for today guys until next time", "iTQB9rJ-5h0": "this is OG ghost train haze number one by rare dance it is a beast footprints like four foot four by four foot six ten gallon high Hey

and I kid you not man stabbing on Psalm endless like wax is just so freakin good man thinking about doing is heating this up for 30 about 30 to 35 seconds and then waiting about 45 seconds to 50 seconds I feel like that gives it the best the taste and it's not very harsh smoke yet you get very very milky clouds so let's go ahead and torch this thing up boys cheers i heated it up to 35 seconds I'm gonna go ahead and let it go till 45 just because I had you have the window open man and I'm gonna go ahead and meanwhile though let's go ahead and choose a nice little chunky one just to start things off boys because honestly I have I've only dabbed it once today and I feel like man this one's gonna catch me because I'm telling you the hatch frozen is so smooth that you only really feel it when it starts building up in your chest man so we're about during your second day and still got another ten and yeah let me know in the comments below if you've ever tried 7-10 labs man if you have

type of legal officer dude this is like literally one of the most aya peeling pieces of bud that I have ever seen and now it's just a fact so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna roll this up I don't know how much help I roll it up but dude this thing is just so phenomenal looking I don't even know if I want to break it apart but I just want to just put this in a casing and just put it in a corner of my room do you never touch it so this thing looks so phenomenal I'm gonna like I said I'm a roll up a joint and I'll see you guys in a little bit right here we got the joint right here man it's honestly I rolled there I've been getting so much better at rolling these freaking joints so all we got to do now man is pretty much just burn off the paperboys and basically here you go here you have it your perfect little or joint now I want to say there's like 1.5 in here man but does it really matter though because I just want to know how good this is man I want to know if it's worth the money because this this 8 was more expensive than a cookie so he hasn't gonna be the first one to find out boys choose only through the age of 18 or 21 whatever it is in your legal statement choose wood hmm after that personation I did get a little bit of some a little bit of paper tape so [Music] whoo it's actually pretty freakin smooth man so far so far I do i I did roll these in some raw hemp papers organic hemp so there might be another reason why but honestly so far it's burning a really really smooth I am getting a lot of earthiness from this plant itself and it's giving off a little bit of a sweet tone but honestly it tastes very very very good like it's something like I know we did we'd look I know we do sweet guys but you can tell the difference from something that is properly cultivated to some [ __ ] that you know that that is make that is being made in mass amounts and things like that like these guys they take so much pride because it's small batch all the time they never they never overdo the batches man because they want to make sure that every single planet that they grow is growing to a hundred percent perfection on their own terms you know but so far man I haven't I'll any clips of this this it's burning very very smooth like I'm telling you let me give you guys a little close-up of pilots burning right I rolled it really really good it's burning even all the way through you got the little tip right there if you ask them to see that and it's an enjoyable smoke man it's currently 10 o'clock in the morning and usually whenever this is the first time I'm smoking also unusually whenever I smoke first my eye like I started coffee or [ __ ] to him whenever it's the first work of a bit but this is smooth like I was saying and it tastes very piney earthy but it's enjoyable as heck I don't taste any really fruitiness flavors of it no I taste a little bit of sweetness but it's not overpowering this thing is chiefing though it's obviously getting me super super baby I ended up waiting a little bit after taking the dabs and then just I mean I rolled out the joint while I was high a [ __ ] and then I roll I waited a little bit more that way I could get the full effects because I didn't want to go from being a super stone because that was a super fat that that I just took I don't want to go from being super stoned to you know getting even more stunning I even being able to differentiate the type of high that I'm getting in the flavor because my mouth was dry as heck I kid you not that dad got me so tight but I was brick and faded for it for a minute I'm not gonna lie I have not been that faded in such a long time and it's such a good feeling now and then they finished chugging milk for sure all boys that looks like we're at had a lighter fluid on our centers [Music] this thing is McEnroe I hope you guys like the new location I mean I'm just in my garage and I hope you guys not like the current location man I was gonna do it in my car but I was like man for a special day like this my mind let's just do it somewhere where you know you guys can see all the smoke around me not the same setting give you guys some a little something different I just in used to Macanese well I'm about to finish this whole joint to the face but not on camera because that would literally turn my videos so freakin long all right guys so my review for this ogk be it's about its max I'm high right now like super faded and it's such a different height such a soothing high but usually with wheat it's either I don't get high or I get like you know too high to the point where I don't even enjoy the high because my head's hurting but this right here yeah but this one right here is honestly just hitting like every single aspect bro like I'm sure I know I know for a fact after I'm done with this I'm probably I'm probably gonna have a better good morning you know I'm already have me good morning gonna go better and EMA like like I would say though I would definitely would not mind dropping another 150 hundred 60 on some 17 laps again like because there I'm telling you they're rosin smack nice it was just the perfect gap the turf through there the taste is there that I was there everything about it was so good and I feel like usually I don't get that feeling with other concentrates you know with other flower so yeah man I would definitely purchase this again time though I do want to try the Persie rosin you know want to try I'm not even sure what kind of strain this was it was like an indica or sativa guessing it's either hinder guard hybrid so next time I want to try just a straight-up indica and see how much that smacks me because I feel like if this give this is smack at me right now I can only imagine what a straight up in meter with you so yeah guys I'm gonna go ahead and hand out the video here because I'm high as a hack right now I just want to enjoy the rest of this man hopefully you guys enjoyed today's video and you know and if you did go ahead and leave a like comment and most importantly hit your boat with that subscribe button and reach so let's try to get 400 K subs I mean 40 K subs boys that's the next call right and you guys are gonna help me do that guys so I hope you guys have a blessed day and we're out", "OLJK1JT08BY": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

gram depending on where and that's in southern california just that's the typical range but honestly it's hard to find stuff of this quality in shops stuff like this usually stays his head stashed it doesn't find its way to shops all right here we go i'm going to give you guys the dab shot the one you've been waiting for okay okay i'm hoping that that's framed up okay check my camera first i think we're a go it's a little close and swap the banger real quick so [Music] cheers i'm gonna get you guys in there in there [Laughter] so so cheers you guys wow [Music] huh fun [Music] wow big head

i'll end up having on that side actually i lied so it's going to be more like right there so there's some room on that side there's some room on that side and then i'll have to uh get these lights just pushed over a tad to the left but it's looking good i got to put these trellis bowls on and that's what i got to do but let me go ahead and let's see if i have my charger can i plug these [ __ ] in oh my god that runs got me baked i'm not even gonna front it's some of the strongest stuff that i've had so far or at least it's so different from everything that i've had in the past that it's just the highest rate it's a definite upper um i do not sorry i'm i'm getting you guys swapped out with the battery here while i talk to you but um it's it's not like oh i'm so high that i'm just not gonna do anything that i was supposed to do now it's more like [ __ ] yeah let's go get work done if this kills the connection i'll be back so okay you said you can't work after taking a dab like that yeah you can with this stuff you can it's a definite like hey you feel good now go get work done that's how we feel it's amazing [Music] so let's put these trellis poles on let's bump some music [Music] [Music] my [Music] so [Music] my [Music] take these off real quick just so i could put this on [Music] so [Music] [Music] ah [Music] really what did i do tighten it too much that's [ __ ]

right there yep [Music] yeah buddy now if i slide you out what are you gonna do you stay there yep you're gonna stay there good [ __ ] good job fantastic so earlier i uh sealed this gap right here i'll check it for leaks and uh make sure that it's good to go and then i just fixed the one small leak i knew i had right here and i think i stepped on this and made a crack somewhere the other day over there i have to fix that but i have the [ __ ] spray right here for the not the spray the adhesive [Music] [Music] yes oh my boy here [Music] yes [Music] i better not wait gain any like type of weight [Music] whatsoever [Music] [Music] [ __ ] you you magnet you're not strong enough what type of [ __ ] magnet are you there's gonna be pain in the ass because there's not a whole lot of room right here this is all the room i have so i have to try and pull the tank table away and take this at an angle no matter what i do it's going to be at an angle that's okay do [Music] do do [Music] oh yeah let's not forget that one [Music] [Music] um you [ __ ] [Music] there [Music] i wish this thing was [ __ ] magnetized little rug burn [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] down [Music] [Music] dog [Music] do i can i can i reach that with my the go-go gadget oh i don't want to lean on this crack never mind let's not do that i was about to lean on it and go get it [Music] [Music] so [Music] this one's a little cramped too [Music] [Music] oh no that's fine i'll leave it on there [Music] yes another beach [Music] [Music] this is a leak detector right here [Music] [Music] so [Music] uh [Music] so [Music] so [Music] oh yeah it's not magnetic [Music] all right so [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] um what else are they going to do i wanted to see if my my rolling bench fits through there i don't know it's like super tight [Music] i feel like i just want it [Music] um all right well [Music] you know what i'm gonna have to do right [Music] i'm gonna take this off and i'm gonna take this outside and i'm gonna chop this off and i'm gonna chop that off [Music] so [Music] okay i gotta do a little bit more work here something i've been needing to finish so bear with me [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] my garage is [ __ ] messy still i know i know but what i don't know is what the [ __ ] happened to my drywall tea [Music] i'm not sitting in there it doesn't fit in there back there no huh well now begins a new adventure where did i put the drywall tea it's a pretty big object in this place interesting got it let's do this [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i [Music] [Music] uh [Music] so [Music] did [Music] so [Music] so [Music] that way when i walk past it i'm not knocking the styrofoam into pieces [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] the lights will keep everything inside here warm [Music] so [Music] okay last edge [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] me [Music] so [Music] appreciate that stones yeah it's definitely about time for a safety meeting but i wanted to knock out this door first i've been lagging [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so uh [Music] [Music] so [Music] so i don't think i'm going to pop seeds yet i think i'm going to do another mono crop and the reason is i don't want to pop seeds and not have uniform lighting up top especially because these are my expensive genetics so i think i'm going to go ahead and run another monoprop to do a side by side between the tfls and the raging [ __ ] don't get stuck on there yet in the raging kush [Music] [Music] i would rather have uniform lighting so that way i could pheno hunt properly it's hard to phenoh hunt when you have different lights going on because the lights control what the plants do so much it's gonna [ __ ] it up and give you skewed data so it's better to run them under uniform lighting foreign [Music] oh [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] bam and i'll create something for these so that they stay pushed together oh i got an idea [Music] i could tape those together [Music] and then it can just fold in half [Music] [Music] life [Music] [Music] so then i can just come in whole thing pops off wiggity wiggity wham slide it over here oh yeah all right it's doable so maybe what i'll do is i'll cut these in half add a couple more magnets and make it like a four piece sectional [Music] you get a yum yum [Music] that works normally i won't have all this [ __ ] in here either so we'll see and then so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] that's not sticky is this the sticky side you sticky all right you sticky [Music] yes [Music] ah [Music] it's not very sticky though might have a problem there [Music] so [Music] that seems a little off way off but there let's get it back on track [Music] i wasn't that far off actually [Music] [Music] not gonna lie i probably should have did it that way from the beginning it would have been way easier [Music] it's cracking so what's up enzo [Music] look at that [Music] yeah that's the top so we'll want to do that one too [Music] so [Music] so [Music] hmm [Music] do [Music] no that's not gonna be enough there so that don't matter i'll put something [Music] there there's nothing across the top there [Music] okay [Music] [Music] is there enough room to do that in here damn there [Music] so let's see how we're looking come over here take this slide up pop that on pop that on that's one maybe if we pull it over some so close the reason i put it on the styrofoam is because i'm not 100 sure that just putting it on this metal part is gonna make it work but we'll see anyways let me go ahead and just put this back up because i'll dick around with how tight it seals [Music] later pretty good though it doesn't need to be 100 light proof my life finally died plug in so let's see seamless cultivar this is the result of that bubble from the other day pretty good so let's smash some of this into a little jar for personal use [Music] so [Music] yeah everybody always likes when you take the top and you do all this [ __ ] to it [Music] i'm going to show you what all the influencers do to their their hash before they post pictures of it they push it down oh [ __ ] don't cut yourself right and then they take their dab tool and they just go like that a bunch of [ __ ] times [Music] that's it [Music] i don't know why i wish i knew i'm not hip to that one guys fire man [Music] all right let's take a dabbaroni one more little magnet here back in boston you didn't know what to do if you're running into like issues with your paws and you guys there's so many variables that it could be it's really hard to diagnose it you know over chat but um yeah if you guys need help dialing in your rosin pressing or your bubble hash processes set me up for consulting easy i have all these beautiful white little crumbs of rosin i'm trying to pick up off my dab mat here i like to waste [ __ ] let's get it watch my phone yeah just like steve said man it's more about the strains i noticed that give you different consistencies sorry check some notifications real quick well let's take a fat little blob not take that small little piece let me take that off there don't want to be greedy this stuff is really smooth and it expands like crazy [Music] hey that's for you guys [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] what [Music] uh [Music] [Music] oh yeah [Music] who's cannabis love there's a lot of really good pressers out there man for sure where did my child go what the [ __ ] i somehow pushed it away weird [Music] so [Music] so [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] true fantastic well it looks like two and a half zippers already on [Music] sorry i have to check the messages check in um people are [ __ ] blowing me up right now it's crazy cannabis love master i don't like that [Music] i don't like anybody that claims the name master grower [Music] [ __ ] [Music] i mean i see some decent grows but i would never ever ever associate the name master with it man not even close master implies you have nothing left to learn i don't get down like that anyways good content though good content oh man this high is great it just flows and flows and flows and flows ah all right well i i personally just think that anybody that calls themself master is a little too arrogant and needs to have a slice of humble pie i mean as much as i know i could i know my nutrient mixes and what they turn out to be because my nutrient mix is the same you know what i'm saying that's the only thing you really measure you know i'm saying yeah you could do that but that's to me that's that's the key to being a true master grower is taking the variables out and not guessing [ __ ] it's taking the time to do that extra step of measuring and making sure you're precise and taking notes and finding out specifically what works you know what i'm saying i don't know different strokes for different folks but if you're not constantly trying to improve your craft that's you know yeah i don't know i don't know anyways all that's left in here is the uh humidifier system that i'm gonna do and this is way though anyways you guys i'm gonna get out of here i got some more work to do before i call it a day so i'll catch you guys tomorrow peace", "l0Umw8g7cQo": "[Music] what's going on guys today we're at the ranch this is our property we have them South Colorado Springs we live in our trailers kick it great views great place to grow pot smoke down all right guys this is the press we are going to be working with today it is a 12-ton rosin press [Music] you can go air compressed or there's a manual option we're gonna go with the manual route today just because we don't want to mess with the air compressor we haven't ran it in a while so we're gonna go with the manual group so we're gonna power it up here it's a little bit difficult to see but we're gonna go ahead and set our temperature [Music] we're gonna be running it at 222 degrees Fahrenheit for this press and we're gonna go ahead and set both our plates that temperature as you can see then we're gonna wait for this bad boy to heat up and we're gonna go press some weed these presses usually run about $1,500 but we actually got quite a good deal and got it for a trade for a pound of weed so usually around 1500 got a fair economy all right everybody here is the weed that we're gonna be pressing in to rosin this is some of our homegrown wheat it is actually four different strains we got some granddaddy purp elephant [ __ ] and EOG tangerine Kush we're gonna try to get about 10 grams of our bud into this puck press and this is what we're gonna be using to press down our weed we're gonna grind up our weed and fill this up and once this is all the way fill you [ __ ] give it a twist and that will tighten it and you put this lid on you screw the lid on and I'll compact all the weed into one nice little puck for the press [Music] alright guys so now that you've seen how that process works we're just gonna fill up and grind up a bunch more weed and we'll see you when that puck pressure's filled up we forgot our big grinders so [Music] alright guys so we're just gonna screw on the lid here and now we're gonna press all the way down into a nice compact puck [Music] dance seven point six minutes all right guys we want to get to ten grams for this press so we're gonna go ahead and put the puck back in and repress the weed to try to get to ten grams [Music] alright everyone here is our new puck [Music] alright guys so the total weight of our puck is 13.8 grams so we're about three point eight over but we wanted but that's alright half an ounce you can see right up here is where we're going our we'd it's a pretty nice setup we'll show you inside in a different video all right we're looking to upgrade that right now so we'll show you the full loop setup when it's all finished we're about there on both of them it's hard to see but both are about two twenty two so we're gonna get the puck in she's ready to go all right guys we're broke as [ __ ] we're using the nonstick just great value parchment paper it works great for this that's all you need we're gonna go ahead and get our two pieces ready [Music] though here is our half of an ounce puck and we're gonna go ahead and put it the press there it is pressing it 222 degrees for roughly in banana half paper good make sure it's centered so we just manually press it together and should get a decent yield from this all right guys we're gonna release it we're gonna take this inside and scrape it oh yeah we got some little dirt here that's right oh yeah [Music] your [ __ ] dabs we're gonna go ahead and take a few so I looks like a good size tab a today's video thanks for watching those are [ __ ] rosin fresh we're gonna take these dad's right now [Music] yeah", "AWUjCsYg6aA": "are you are you coming to the tree the strong local man they say who murdered three strange things

final days of the moonshine haze and she's looking so good these flowers are so plump and ripe now you may recall that this moonshine hey started out as four individual plants from seeds because the seeds were not feminized they were just regular so out of the four seeds I got two males and two females there's actually two plants here and as has happened with me in the past when I've grown two plants in the same tub of the same strain one of them will invariably dominate in the other will recede and that's what happened here I've got one big huge plant that wraps all the way around and fills in down here and then there's this smaller plant the second one its sister but it's much smaller and we can see down here see the two different trunks to plants but this one in the foreground here is a smaller one and she's about a week behind in development she's ripening nicely but she's about a week behind in this larger plant so I'm gonna have to harvest sessions and I'm gonna have to harvest the the big plant first and then give it about another week or so for the smaller one cuz I don't want to harvest I don't want to just cut everything down just to clear the tent I don't want to leave a plaintiff of this stature even though she's small she's still she's looking a lot of flowers and I don't want to just let that get harvested too early I want I want both harvests to be consistent with each other so there it is probably be posting another video when I harvest well just one more thing you can see I have my ultraviolet light right here hanging and shining those beneficial ultraviolet radiation what moonshine hates so that's it for now that's a wrap thanks for watching be sure to LIKE and subscribe we'll see you next time", "xU1y9mX6jio": "here we go what's good YouTube welcome to another live stream can already take a few dabs and hang out it's just got done prepping for another hash wash damn it getting cold in here too because of that I might have to go grab my jacket but um yeah got the AC cranked to 62 degrees that the ice-cold water in the reservoir I've got a bag of ice for the washer and I've got six more bags ice out in the freezer I need to get a bigger freezer and all the materials well so later tonight after I get the kids down spend some time with the wife I'm gonna come back out here and knock out that bubble hash run uninterrupted probably gonna do somewhere between six to eight runs on it depending on how it looks and how everything is coming out [Music] anyways let's go ahead and get a - go in here I hope you guys are having a good day [Music] that was not clickbait by the way for those of you this joint this is a 104 grant or 100 Ford's a hundred grams now mixed strain hash frothing some cookies some sweet cream some zukie and what else sweet cream cookie sweet cream zoo keys and orange cookies that's what it is [Music] sorry I had someone from work pop-up I don't look out real quick [Music] all right cool [Music] anyways let's go ahead oh it's so good yeah I need to go ahead and fill up a little bit char with that [Music] this was some 60 micron parabola for edibles [Music] this one still has a cush cake in it and this one has on a fish cake so those that's my head - cooks cake in a jar [Music] earth is [ __ ] cold and her alright so I would like you yet in my day did you imagine dabbing that whole thing just like here we feel [ __ ] half the Banger ease and the easily I wouldn't even try it it'd be a waste and a half that's good enough for me enjoy that for the week [Music] the 160 press was man very little in there so that's what that looks like when I end up putting it in the jar and then a lot of people would ask me how did you get that [ __ ] rossington to stick to the bottom of the jar look so neat [Music] here's I take the glove and you're just going to push it down around the edges towards the center you're doing a cold room that's good rosin a clean glove and just like that now it looks like that [Music] with that's hard to see but yeah that's how that comes out when you end up doing that push it down it comes out real nice and clean looking perfect for grams or so it's upload a bird [Music] all right so I gotta move my dad station over now I'm not pressing it back over here well I like it Kiyo is : grab yeah you can do with parchment - I have a little bit more control with the glove I feel like and it rarely gets sticky but parchment works to a more sticky stuff I will use parchment I'm gonna go grab a hoodie real quick [Music] [Music] whoa [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] whoo my tears my eyes [Music] Oh [Music] oh man the big dads always get my nose my eyes [Music] Oh [Music] about three days away from the harvest yeah we're on day 54 honestly I think I could pull them down tomorrow or the next day I want it probably gonna go ahead and harvest them on Monday [Music] today's Thursday tomorrow's Friday yep I'm go ahead and harvest them on Monday [Music] five six out of the gate 58 [Music] [Music] I got some pictures of the plants I haven't even posted to Instagram yet pausing to share them with you guys real quick [Music] [Music] turn down the lights already this whole side is just [ __ ] Mileena should be up here these ones dried back a little bit too much almost too much but not too two months still prosti of [ __ ] 12 cars black out there my Spade going over there [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so that's the current status in the Guardian you know just like oh my flesh for usually you're about seven days it's that but you know [Music] I had issues this run just like Ross Leafs his issues because he's in cocoa they're harder to detect early and so he faced the consequences of the buffering that cal-mag provides in coma cocoa I wasn't in at nursery iam so I was able to turn my issues around a little bit faster but you know basically what I'm saying is you know I had issues this run and the crop is still coming out pretty good so next run you know those issues will be corrected I'll make a video covering the issues that I ran into this grow and how I plan to correct them and I'll throw it up on the patreon hopefully you guys can learn from some of my mistakes you know I talked about on the show doing your own research and shape one of the things I researched if I should have used top-down broward rivers and when I talked to mango tech Abadi he told me to use two gallons per hours to avoid clog and that's what each use is but then I ended up getting water channeling that is too fast on the float and I cost a lot of issues I never really fed high enough of an ECE to have the easy build up nor did I ever push the plants that hard to cause them to have any lockouts it was all because my irrigation was wrong from the get-go with the water swim [Music] are you taking off right now that's one of the changes I'm implementing is not only am I going to get rid of the 2 gallon per hour but I'm going to go all the way down to like a point 3 gallon per hour dripper that could eat drawstring and stuff up here so yeah that'll fix a lot of issues right off to that that I believe uh Charles and pastor [Music] that Daffy got me hired balls rolling in on me now [Music] oh my bad I look here looking up and showers my phone [Music] there's no broad my issues going on in here all it is is either a they were different cuts or they were microclimates right he talked about the water channeling so you know phosphorus deficiency can learn to purpling stems and the plants that express themselves differently also has purple stems where I was the ones that didn't have the red bugs didn't have purple stems so I think it was more of a microclimate issue water channeling issue causing different uptake different nutrients and it just got exacerbated due to the lockout because of the water channeling so next one I'm doing is with wedding cake and I should be getting those clones in about two weeks so I have about two weeks to prep get the plants chopped harvested and everything I'll flip them right in the room that they're in right now I'm basically going to push the tables to one side of the room and then I'll go in and use a light rail for this up against the wall and I'll cut down on the one plant out of time and hang it on a trellis hanging from the ceiling and then I'll just hang all the plants from one light all right [Music] when my moustache hairs on the know it wouldn't happen I got trim my mustache geez so yeah basically just go one light at a time right down hole lights worth of plants hang them go to the next one cut those down hang out on a different trailer that's there the next one so I'll have three trellis nets hanging on the side of the room I'll have to retry this netting on that side of the room so after I cut down the whole left side of the room and those plants are hanging up there on that left side I'm going to disassemble the tables and walk them out of the room and then I can push that whole other table completely over to the middle of the room hang up all those buttons on the back side of the room or wherever in the room right and then basically I'll be good to go I'll get everything hung I'll turn off the shaker fan I'll just keep one of them on probably maybe turn it down to low or something and I'll just have to DEET you and AC going in there I'll be able to scrub down the you the four by twelve that's in there now scrub it down and get it reset and start making my adjustments to the room while I wait on my new 4 by 12 American Girl products they're probably they told me it was going to be issued early June like June 8th or 6 but they might be able to get it in sooner so I mean worst case scenario the room will be down for about three weeks while I wait on the new table but I'll just match all the plants on one table while I'm doing that perfect and then when I get my new table in I'll be able to go ahead and transition the plants over throw up my trellis mats and pretty much switch so you know that's the plan and like I said I'll document all the changes to the room it said of everything that I'd be like want to document the changes and yeah my keeper fee no cuts from honest genetics should be here in the next two to three weeks and solved a whole room full of wedding cake in there veg and flour that while I have a child my keeper he knows from our genetics and my new keeper you know caked up cherries wedding cake crossed with cherry something f3 I'm going to do the three-tiered setup but I'm waiting on him to send me the updated invoice for the new poles and as soon as I get those I'll be able to set it up and I'll have pretty much what I was thinking of doing them what happened to rekey poofy nose and I could basically put all of them on their own tier if I wanted and then have clones next to it or I could just put all the moms on one and then since I'm doing two tables at a time I'll just pick you know I'll have two tiers for clothes you know cherry cookies have three thank you thank you thank you I never remember like my keeper he knows from honest I don't remember what I was are either blue hurricane 27 crossed with white sunrise for the blue lion keeper and then scarlet sure is chocolate frosting crossed with something I think [Music] I trust my man on his genetics he tells me yo this is a [ __ ] you should run for a hash let's fire fire fire legs all right now you got it [Music] like I remembered it enough to purchase it and you know that's all that matters now that's all that matters now I need to show up in the garden [Music] so stoked I have I'll have the blue Hawaiian which is gonna have exotic super crazy unique blue Terps it's gonna be highly sativa dominant as far as the high goes and then the truck not the truck cherry but the cakes of cherries that's gonna be my cherry Fino right there so I'll have a blue of a cherry and then I have the gassy out of scarlet shirt so it's gonna be dope [Music] this is real the kind of light that I use for clowns are right behind either the raging raging kales and I actually got sponsored by science LED yeah so I will be getting now raging candle LEDs probably twice a year during two biggest ways that I do and it couldn't be [ __ ] dope it can really know and then every other month or so I'll be giving away a bunch of science LED swag hats ashtrays shirts things like that all be put on there grower spotlight on their homepage pretty shortly here I have some pictures that I have to take for them and type up some some information and what else asked me to leave to help them do research spectrum tuning and hash production so I'll be doing that so and then also the big thing I'll be an authorized reseller for their lights on my webpage as soon as it's up in a few days so as soon as the page is up I'm going to try and get them on there and I'll be able to resell a life through my page so that way you know they don't do they don't do coupon codes like people in the industry you got to use to coupon codes because of for flex and all that but what that does is it makes it so that you can't sell that product in brick-and-mortar stores anymore and in the hydro industry almost need brick-and-mortar stores still surprisingly to you know expand and survive because still a big commercial facilities go through these hydro stores and you know direct to these manufacturers a lot so they don't do coupon codes they're like let's say they offer a 10% discount code here in California right and somebody purchases a light from you know from me and using my promo code but they're in Oregon or something and or somewhere else where they maybe don't charge sales tax and now not only are they getting the 10% off but they're also getting like seven or eight maybe taking even up to 10% off of that because of no sales tax right whereas if they were to purchase it in the store you know the store would be able to make a profit but in order to compete with that price that they would get you know from using the coupon code the brick-and-mortar store would basically have to not turn a profit so it doesn't work out for them to be able to give people who coupon codes stacked as representatives of the brand so instead I'll be able to be a reseller and then just a very very small portion of the profit that they would make from that light will go towards me instead so I'll be an authorized reseller and then basically helping do research and you know passing that information you guys like I have been this whole time so anyways this is what we're working with they bought this is delicious delicious it's called cookie dough and it's amazing [Music] I don't suspect this is gonna last long you won't need a code to let them know who sent you because you're gonna go through my website to purchase they're working on other programs like referral codes and things like that but [Music] yeah I guess I should keep this on camera so people don't think that I'm like lying and I say I got a grandfather drive here we did well today it's real I wouldn't had a couple more but honestly you guys want to get jars of the grape Cosby and literally all I have left of this [Music] that's it but in this drawer it's maybe maybe seven grams six seven grams of the grape Cosby I think the other jars been scraped empty already yeah scraped empty great cause be gone on that one and then the hell a Koosh cake [Music] there's like maybe two to three grams to scrape out of here [Music] and this one I think is scraped completely empty yeah there's maybe like point two in here it's empty so there was 70 72 grams of the La Push cake and 60 grams of the Cosby [Music] but every time you come in here you [ __ ] promotin be real oh no no no who was it last time it wasn't beaver oh it was your boy the other one that's not good Bernhard that's who it was last time [Music] about your ass sorry yo for real alright here's the funny story that's how you guys are quick so the reason this one got called rape Cosby because [Music] my wife and I dabbed it and she got so [ __ ] high off of it it was like she got roofied like straight roofie I could have done anything I wanted to so I was like mother kali shake great cosby it tastes like grapes and knocks you the [ __ ] out like you did this it was between grape Cosby and roofie colada you know think of work 12 but you guys got to make sure you do it right [Music] it's great cause be like that lowercase G Capital are [Music] all right let's get [Music] a little credit given to me I need a label hood [Music] it's not for grams but whatever [Music] you know [Music] so we're gonna get some cookie dough on there a menace [Music] they push tape on there [Music] [Music] [Music] me up a man popular science [Music] my episode 5 right there alone [Music] [Music] there was a five [Music] [ __ ] bones knock out maybe this is episode [Music] all right hold on okay [Music] but right now it is [Music] but few days that idiot that ain't the one all right well [ __ ] it I'll get it uploaded I was trying to do it right now but I'm having a little bit of a hard time finding a you write for [Music] oh here it is [Music] [Music] that's not it either I have like a lot of different files in here that I have to go through [Music] that's three lighting maybe this is the right here number four [Music] okay yeah here it is and as this little my everybody [Music] alright I'll go ahead and get this uploaded to YouTube right you know [Music] I'm kind of done editing these I'm just gonna start uploading the RAW files and if people don't like it they can kiss my ass I don't have time to edit them together anymore that's why I put the PowerPoint how I did you know if I do the PowerPoint I don't have to worry about putting an intro and all that into the video it's just boom okay boss [Music] alright crap dude my science for plant nutrition are a cool description I'll edit that later now don't care playlist crafted science done no it's not made for kids don't have to restrict [Music] monetization please do [Music] public [Music] boom what is instant premiere oh [ __ ] we could watch it together at the same [ __ ] time let's [ __ ] do that right now I did not know we could do that that is really cool we can watch the video together yeah three minutes five all right it's 321 I'm gonna go in at 3:45 and help the wife for the day because that's the way it is [Music] I find on finishing of the loose jars oh that's the one section of illustrator [Music] this is it makes a great Cosby and Kush cake [Music] I don't know what I did mother two minutes [Music] okay a little poison for 30 minutes okay no accident since a wait okay I'll be in by say like 3:45 okay okay [Music] 59 seconds left [Music] very good dogs very good slowly giving them a little bit more freedom and hoping that they don't [ __ ] pee anywhere [Music] green jeans with Superdome [Music] Greenjeans was sooo Oberto 11 seconds 8 seconds that's called your video will premiere what's uploading and processing finished as well as the hundred percent uploaded is 95 percent process I have no idea how this is going to look for you guys I don't know how this works I've never done this before it is [ __ ] top-down so we're gonna check it out oh my god dollars people my DM right now [Music] all right you guys let me know what happens on your end when this is done hopefully I mean it doesn't take forever right now it's an remember you two processes videos one definition at a time so the low definition stuff is going to process and then like for whatever and then 720 and 1080 [Music] my phone right now it's just doing the load F [ __ ] the standard definition version we'll see whatever the [ __ ] back [Music] I'm really curious to see what this does though man that was such a good [ __ ] good [ __ ] episode and then episode 5 I'm glad we took a break because we were really [ __ ] burned out both of us and we needed a skip a week we came back and we didn't even have a PowerPoint or anything but it was still an amazing discussion Garrett jumped online from science at levy and he just [ __ ] to talk about what we wanted to talk about which was great just you know [Music] we just talked about troubleshooting it was [ __ ] awesome you know he get his perspective on things like walking into like a huge commercial facility and how you would troubleshoot their [ __ ] to figure out what's going on why certain part of the crop might not be doing its good versus another part things like that so it was really cool to get his perspective because you know as far as lost leaf goes he's a commercial facility but he's a one-man army and it's a small commercial facility it's the size of a house basically a one-story house and so and that's that's no diss whatsoever [ __ ] it's amazing what he's doing I wish I could be at his level but in the realm of commercial grows it's relatively small so you know his perspective is one and then Maya the home grower is another and then Gary brings a whole different perspective being that he's kind of more on the large large scale commercial and so it was really cool you know and go with it so unfortunately during this whole Cove 8:19 thing all of the HD recordings for webinars are being limited and only being allowed standard definition so this is not going to be best of qualities for the uploads that are going on right now from the webinars and there's nothing that we can do about that so you know [Music] check it on the patreon real quick make sure you guys got your post real quick [Music] are you guys waiting on me to take another dab is that what's going on [Music] I guess [Music] it's not what you guys I feel like a little [ __ ] a dab [ __ ] for you guys it's all you guys wanna take your dad show me his plan it's never hey SB Andy how's your day go what'd you do today need some help no I'm just [ __ ] one shot I already forgot what this one is again that's the coach tasted positive and he's more paper towels real quick cuz my house got so high I forgot to clean the [ __ ] banger after the last job that's [ __ ] I I guess I Cosby myself whoever said don't cause be yourself I can't be myself go clean it out real easy paper towels to clean [Laughter] [Music] yeah all of the rapidly science episodes go on patreon pretty much the same day or minimum a week earlier than YouTube a minimum and Matt doesn't post on lost leaf as a poster or anything like that out of respect for my patreon supporters he knows he waits again he's a week two to three weeks even suppose I mean it's not that I don't want the information out there for everybody but I wanted to I want to give some [ __ ] love to the people on patreon and economic access all that and they can pick my brain talk about it on live sessions or whatever brain different [ __ ] you know [Music] all right the tip of my II now is 395 and I need to grab another roll of paper towels real quick [Music] [Music] damn [ __ ] oh yeah [Music] oh [ __ ] [Music] in the filter [Music] oh Jesus son 525 that is a very very high [ __ ] gasps Jesus [Music] [Music] so the reclaim catcher works by basically a when you draw on the dab it gets stuck down here because all that reclaimed can't travel back up pretty much so what you end up with really is just tiny tiny pieces of the vapor that condensed back to rosin in here versus a shit-ton of replaying and if you have a really good deep-dish banger and you do low temp doubts your your reclaim actually can look really nice how well that looks but [Music] seeing us a thing FPV not everybody's email setup is the same not all coils are created equal so you got to get you know a good coil setup with this I can go three eighty and still get clouds [Music] you need some sort of cloud [Music] all right [Music] my emails from 7-10 coils and you have promo codes with them but up go my man go in the house [Music] did I even bring the [ __ ] Paper Towns yeah I did oh yeah okay don't really need to take another dad titanium holy [ __ ] [ __ ] son if you don't swap that over some glass you can get like a full email kit for around in 250 years [Music] [ __ ] [ __ ] that olive oil will get you bro oh alright you [ __ ] I'd have been dying for this dad for some reason or she dies or more yeah I got ahold of the giveaway winner and he commented all over my YouTube video and everything that following morning Jesus sweet baby Jesus my nose is already like crying thinking about these Turks [Music] Oh titanium is not 2008 oh my gosh bro oh [ __ ] that's funny I've already got throat tickle mmm take him to any dab my throats already got that little scorch to it oh but I'm a man up and finishing [Music] [Music] [Music] we [Music] that's how you beast down and down right there [Music] fire [Music] [Laughter] [Music] I'll have a lot of patience going back up there to deal with kids right now oh yeah [Music] cruising today today is flying by I feel like I woke up two hours ago [ __ ] took five dives I blinked and boom it's already about four here had to clean that tonight [Music] just blowing our play too much [Music] the function on Agentry is crazy [Music] so FPV ahead I wasn't enough cloud for you where are these jars just ridiculous [Music] [Music] [Music] well can't even open it with one hand [Music] you're saying horrible with the [ __ ] up-close [Music] so so good [Music] this lighting is any different was natural lighting appear it's that cookie dough [Music] all right you guys [Music] I'll catch you guys on the next one I'm gonna call it a night I had a bunch of other [

big he got real big he got a little fatter get a little cuddlier but it so without further ado let's uh at least discuss why we're here today today i am going to press what's left of all of my cheese hash i made all of the rest of my uh cheese into hash on an instagram stream about two days ago so this is all bubble hashed it's all been dried out uh ground up sifted sorted out not sifted pardon me i didn't sift it um i don't care that much it's all getting squished it'll be just fine it was all bud buster and then in there and then i took a knife and kind of chopped it all up and spread it around on parchment paper for for two days after it was all kind of dried um actually here you know what i took a picture and i can show you the picture that's what i can do oh god no it's going to rotate my stupid phone stop rotating there we go so there is the hash crumble at the beginning and that's what it looked like after being bug-busted that's the exact same product just hash crumble from bubble hash all dried out or somewhat dried out and then bud busted and then all of it was bud busted and we got it right here so i need to actually put that sort of rotate thing back on here for um i got a a camera mount thing that we're gonna be able to utilize this here in a minute and uh and do a pressing grated cheese yeah um well first off let's find out what we're we're dealing with weight wise and then we'll go over and press it i know everybody's all wiggy about the weights i don't know how much cannabis went into it um it was probably somewhere in the four to ounce range maybe i don't know it's hard to say like i said it's somewhere in that range so here let me uh come over to the top cam let's see if the top cam can see this sure it can see how it says zeros yeah you can see the zeros okay let me put my shades down for a second here and see if i can oh so carefully grab all of this so here's all the hash like i said this is all of it right here so let's let's dump it in and find out how much we're dealing with weight wise 15.8 almost 16 grams a little over 15 and a half grams nice now i'm predicting a minimum i want i want 10 grams 10 grams of hash rosin or i'm not going to be happy with this yeah i think uh i think 10 grams is a pretty good uh guesstimation return on this come on find a spot to just sit right there sure there we go okay um and then we'll have some [ __ ] then i'll dab upon it once i frickin now we gotta do a couple of things number one we gotta turn the [ __ ] lights on in here um i'm gonna have to grab my phone here let me set this back up again done turn off the audio or we get a weird feedback and start like that and let's see if uh hey hey hey it [ __ ] works ding ding ding don't forget to like that video if you do so like it like that video i mean this video right here let me just put you onto the gimbal here for a second it's gonna go wonky while i turn it on there we go except we're gonna rotate it like that there we be um i need one more thing i need scissors and i need to angle this [ __ ] down like that right there now i'm gonna have to come back here and take a look at uh chat once in a while um but i cannot see chat over here so uh please please understand that when i'm streaming a lot of times if i don't respond to your chat it's not because i'm a prick it's because i probably didn't see it um i mean i guess i'm a little bit of a prick but that's that's not that's not the actual case here um okay now before we make a bag actually i'm one step ahead of myself here before we make a bag um we need to decide what size pouch i'm putting all this into um so these are the new ones i just got these are two by four and a half all the standard dab press bags are two by four and a half as you can see um and that's good for columns and stuff but then there's these three and three by fives um a little bit wider i like these ones i do um i think i'm gonna go with this because i can make a pretty big pouch like this i can make sort of a bigger square pouch um now actually i wonder hold on a second should i make a bigger square pouch like that or just a longer skinnier pouch like this i think actually maybe let's try the new one the new pouches though these are brand new this will be the first one i've ever used of these let's try these out i guess i'm so waffly i don't know what to do we'll try those out but the reason i'm saying what matters here is because i need to decide um once i fill this i don't even know if that'll you know what i might have to use this big one yeah we might have to use the big one here um just to fit it all to be honest i hadn't really considered that but that's uh i think what's gonna happen here to be honest um okay now this is kind of a pain in the ass um i'm going to use this piece of scrap paper i have sitting over on the side here to pour all of the weed or the hash upon and use this as a funnel to get it into the actually do about half of the time because that's a lot wow well i'm going to try to get it all into one single press here is what i'm going to try to do but i'm going to probably only put it into the bag here half at a time there we go there we go and then we'll do the rest of the three okay oh my hands are shaky today there we go so anyway this is the reason i'm doing this is because you don't want this bag to be too pillowy so about i feel like about half is probably going to be really good now i'm also due to the fact that this is so wide skinnier is a little bit better because it has less places to get stuck in the middle due to the fact this is such a wide pouch i will be folding this in half and and second pressing it at some point um for now all i'm going to do with this though is i'm going to do a double fold on that um let me see do i have anything i can press that down with um i guess this is sort of a thing i could press it down with a little bit there we go you want to give it yeah there we go you want to get just a little bit of pressure because hash sort of holds its position once you once you give it a little squish because it's so sticky okay so now that we've got that established let's put him aside um so i want that right about yeah okay probably right where i got it is actually probably a real good guess here i thought we could have just cut an average piece of paper and made it work i am however going to do something a little bit different this time this will be actually the same as the last time i did a hash rossing press i do a little pouch system a little pouch system for the hash rosin versus if i was doing flower i would just do like this envelope system now let's take a look at this in size here again for a second we want to give it plenty of room so [Music] like that yeah that's lots of room i mean not too much room we want it to kind of come all forward the best we can but you don't want to get jammed in there and then freaking like have problems or something right so that's that um now one more thing we do is since i'm gonna this is gonna be sitting in here right about like that leaving just about the same amount of width around it we're going to probably cut this whole thing pretty loosely i'm going to give it a little more space just to be safe i'll cut it down to size if i need to so that's the pouch that i'm going to be spread pressing in and then this is the uh the actual parchment that's going to catch everything now so what we're going to do is that goes into there kind of like that and oh sorry you can't see anything there we go um so i've also got this uh set at 165 both plates are set to 165 which is not very high okay now before we go too much further here i want to put this in it's in it's freaking new home here now one of the things you can do before i do this is actually cut these on slight angles like this i'll show you why seems like a lot of weird steps but look what this does this makes this a nice cleaner edge sorry right there it makes it a nice cleaner edge by cutting slight angles on that so it's less things for it to get stuck to on the way out you'll see what i'm talking about soon anyway let me fold this pouch back up again here let me get one little extra fold there and then that so i don't want this thing leaking at all i'm gonna put that right to the back for the moment now one of the things i need to do pre-close this press a little bit get this [ __ ] down to about more manageable height okay right about there now i'm just sort of positioning it where i want it to sit in the plate not worrying about the the papers just yet we're worrying about where the the position of that is now give me a second here there we go once it gave us just the littlest bit of resistance um i'm gonna stop it right there i'm gonna fold this like that and re-pin it while it's folded and then kind of make a lip up like that so actually i don't think that's gonna be good enough yeah there we go i guess i could push that back further there we go that's what i'm gonna do that's how i'm gonna do it okay now let me get this a bunch closer i'm going to come over and take a quick second a quick peek-a-boo over here at chat bef while that's uh just warming just getting warm in between there ah let me uh let me pop back over here and say hello and have a sip of my coffee for a second here uh that was the camera there we go there we go thank you just save 15 on an ac infinity beard hey thank you thank you for supporting the the the um the companies that support beard and uh i'm glad more than happy to uh accumulate massive discounts for you all um it's the least i can do uh and it is one of the things i do make sure i every time i talk to um uh i talk to a new company uh that's the first thing i say is uh uh you know not the first thing i say but as soon as we start to come into some sort of an agreement uh i do mention the fact that um i need a good discount for the community and uh and or preferably and some sort of a giveaway or a freebie or something if it's something big it's harder to do giveaways i get it but discounts at least okay okay i'll have a quick dab oh a quick little puff off some i got something around here there we go white widow hash rosin right there i'll have a quick little poof i want to save myself for that [ __ ] cheese though right there i'm really excited for that hello colleen and nice shades i know right say uh uh well don't you don't need to say thank you i say thank you to uh uh grot's homegrown there that this was a a a christmas and xmas xmas gift if you will i [ __ ] like these things man they're cool not only they look cool they match my [ __ ] flag i was like a little bit disappointed in the first like three seconds that they weren't green but you know what i [ __ ] like them i'm kind of glad they're not green it's broken me out of my need for green shades i don't think i needed green shades i think i passed up on a lot of cool shades because they weren't green green's still going to be a lot of my staple but i dig these [ __ ] thank you again okay let me uh have a sip of my coffee and then we will start pumping this thing have i ever tried thca um everybody has that's a long story i know what you're asking and yes i have as a concentrate yes i have but everybody's tried thca if you smoked pot because that's how it converts to get you stoned long story i want to get into it okay now let's get this thing just a little more stable and a little more a little more right pointed at the deal right there that should be good okay now this is now that's not pressure yet but i assure you that's probably got a grip on it now yeah that's got a grip that ain't coming out now this is one of the first stages you get a it's a you got to be a little bit slow and a little bit uh methodical with this here please folks don't forget to thumb up the video if you have not already done so um because once you're not gonna wanna stop staring once this freaking once this flow once this lava flow starts here you're not gonna wanna freaking blink so there's a little bit more pressure right there just a little bit i'm using only one finger just so you know one finger on the on the jack i'm not putting any actual strength on anything just yet let's see can i zoom is that a thing i can do i don't know no i can't now i'm going to give it just a little bit more finger single finger still pump okay i'm starting to get a little bit of resistance from the single finger now starting to feel that that bit of resistance oh i see some darkness i think something's coming maybe nothing's gonna happen can you imagine what do you think folks is it a dud or is it just a slow avalanche waiting to happen i think it's a slow avalanche because i haven't put any pressure on this yet i think i can see some oh i can see some that darkness there that you see right there that is that is it so here we go i'm gonna give it a little tiny bit of pressure not much just enough to make it have to go somewhere now we might not get an avalanche due to the fact that i sort of gave probably more room than i should have on um on the sides if i if i had tucked that in a little tighter it would have pushed it forward a lot harder oh sorry kicked the thing there it's right there though it's just not wanting to spew just yet it's a thick cheese man it's coming out like a freaking cheese slice oh there we go that's the first time that the that was a single hand press but that was the first bit of pressure that it actually moved there we go there's our first drip uh that's the first time it actually moved the press a little bit so now any any subsequent pressure that i want to add to this is gonna require two hands now one hand is no longer doing it i went from one finger to one hand and now it's gonna be a two-hander a little more pressure there just a little little bit two finger two finger kind of pressure i'm gonna come over here and say hello to hello to chat ah about to buy an sf uh 1000 for vegging with your code right on uncle um [Music] uh adam's pressing uh morning colleen adam is pressing some special rosin for you it's uh on par with my good presses from last year adam calls it sky crack ooh i actually got some sky crack coming as well i'm told man look at that froth here it comes it's a slow it was a slow one and it's a little darker than i imagined honestly considering that the the hash itself was a nice blonde color it's a little darker than i would have imagined and that's uh that is okay here let me uh let me adjust the camera just a little bit i think i have to go up to go down no down to go down it's not airplane rolls it should be it would make more sense oh that's too far you can't see the whole top now there we go there we go that looks like the the butter zone um no sir this is uh um this is cheese deep cheese it says right in the um right in the title there i was smoking on white widow i had a puff earlier on video here of a white widow that i had already ready but i'm not going to smoke anymore now until i smoke this because this is what i want to smoke on this is what we're here to do this is why we're here today okay i'm going to give it a little little tiny bit more pressure here give it a little little there we go a little coax what happens after a while too is um uh the the pressure starts to sort of equalize a little bit and it actually gets kind of relaxed at pressing it at that it might have shown it some resistance in the beginning but um once it uh uh once it starts to to squish on it for a little bit it starts to relax a little bit and then thus giving you a little tiny bit more room to push further to a point you know you don't want to uh uh overpress this although at the same time i am doing a envelope style with a backup so um it's much much much harder to break paper doing it in this manner another little squeeze here okay that's getting pretty tight i'm not going to get much more pressure out of that i might get one more little tug out of it here in a moment but that's pretty much it man again uh i'm gonna have to re-press this puck i just know it it's just the the nature of the beast so i'll probably still get i bet y'all still get a like two grams or so out of repressing this once i do yeah i don't think we're going to get a whole lot more out of this now this is going to kind of wig a few of you people out here but this is one of the ways i i sort of finalize give it a little press down like this it squeezes out the yeah there we go squeezes up the little baggie there and gives you more room if um i'm gonna give it another good there we go that's the last squish i'm gonna give it uh it just sort of pushes everything out of the way and gives you a little tiny bit more room for the stuff to come out perhaps see we're getting we're getting a little more movement here in the center whereas we weren't getting any movement in the center because it was all plugged up it was all clogged up with the oils give me a couple of seconds here i'm going to taste it all as soon as i as soon as i freaking collect it here in a couple of seconds i'm going to give it a good taste okay put the scales aside there so we'll look at that in a few minutes here once we get this going take some position like that okay here we go i think we're kind of ready no actually no you know what i know better than this i know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna go like that and say see thanks for watching on that feed oh that's really weird i'll fix that in a second i was gonna say i'm just gonna come over come over to the desk here and we'll open it up on camera here's the desk oh i gotta get rid of that sorry sorry uh where is this one here uh that camera froze on the last image is what it did there we go um and we're actually going to go with this top camera right here that's what we're going to work with today holy crap holy crap yeah this is going to be a we're going to have to repress this freaking sticky bastard for sure let me grab this here we go i needed a piece of paper to put this thing on this is a mess in here i can feel this paper right here is just tacky tacky tacky oh goodness oh man there we go like i said i will repress this here that is absolutely got lots more in it so uh do not consider this a final weight but i'm excited to fricken get into this okay where's my dab too where's my dang dab tool there we go there we go i cleaned up a dab tool prior for this okay so let's do this [ __ ] how am i gonna do this i'm gonna put this aside the big pouch aside here for just one second and let me get this up here this is going to be an absolute breeze to get up i can oh my goodness it's so not i'm like oh this is going to be maybe it's got to cool down a second hold on oh yeah i can feel that it's still warm oh no i think i'm gonna have to freeze this all this is so gummy oh no yeah it's gonna have to be frozen well that's okay we can definitely get some dabs in here i just won't be able to collect it all or tell you a proper [ __ ] weight on it maybe i can i don't know man holy smokes holy frig this smells like insane though what do we got here um well whatever i'll just put some over here holy crap this smells good though it's it's just so terpy um yeah i think while i have a puff of this i'm gonna go put all the rest of this in in the freezer here for a second and uh in hopes that maybe i can cool it down with this plate too i'm gonna take the plate and everything and uh give it a few minutes of coldness maybe that'll that'll allow us to collect it okay okay now let's have a [ __ ] dab of this what we've collected so far and uh and then i'll take that out of the freezer and that should be collectible just sometimes if the terpene ratios are off man it gets really really really really hard to [ __ ] collect and uh that doesn't happen very often but it usually happens with [Applause] cheeses interesting cold air just blowing cold air on it interesting interesting we go folks wish me luck hmm oh man oh so cheesy oh goodness so cheesy so cheesy [ __ ] customers eh god dang it [Music] i actually usually have colleen that plate that's here i usually have that in the freezer ahead of time however um i didn't because it's been pretty cold in my basement and all the other strains that i've been pressing lately were super super super easy cleanups this one is the first one that's given me any grief in the hash department i want one more puff though i'm gonna have at the end i'll have a [ __ ] puff from the from the freaking the proper taste test rig after we freaking collect it let me have one more puff and i'll run and grab it air conditioner yeah that's a good idea too i've been able to frickin uh uh get it all off the it's real sticky sir i haven't been able to tell your return yet i'm hoping i can find that out in a minute give me a second i got a new song and i [ __ ] didn't change it and i forgot hold on giving it another minute upstairs isn't gonna hurt it in the fridge there click on the correct account that be can a beard now where is that song i just downloaded there it is okay so then now i go to all widgets um donation goals alert box i think it's the alert box yeah so general settings donations we got the dancing cactus and we got the jammy song right there so um i'm going to have to um select audio upload where is that dang thing um that one um that one that one there we go now um and then super chat um also needs to be switched over to that one and and then i think we're done bam just like that okay i'll be right back i'll be right back okay there we go definitely not trying to uh uh uh incite tipping however i did just change the song and i think that that'll fix my little problem that i had i think speaking of thinking let's see if this is going to co oh yeah there we go yep so here let's switch this back over to top cam real quick there we go let's act quickly while it's nice and cold but it's acting the way it should hi can a cat how you doing little buddy just playing with some [ __ ] garbage in the hallway or something piece of paper or something there we go now we're [ __ ] cooking yeah no problem oh [ __ ] come on there we go i can't even rip paper there we go so there's first blob um [Music] i dig it what do you think what do you all think of the new song is that acceptable it's royalty free those [ __ ] bastards over at mgn or whoever the [ __ ] that company was it kept trying to [ __ ] me over can't try anymore okay i need this piece of paper here as a backdrop i love love love 80s arcade nostalgia there's something [ __ ] about old video games nostalgia that i cannot [ __ ] neglect when it comes to the the style of my channel in case you haven't noticed the old television and and and that kind of action right okay it's still pretty sticky but it's coming this time you hear that it's coming that's right i made it come off the paper by cooling oh man the whole the paper or the paper never seen a little bit of paper it's all sticky man ah [ __ ] paper that's a [ __ ] criminally underrated movie man water world got a bad rap and i [ __ ] love that movie it's terrible but it's awesome it's like a good bad movie it's it is terrible but in oh no in such a glorious way okay where's that oh no where's the stuff there we go look at this look at this there we go yeah let's just get you off the paper here for a second holy crap this cheese is a [ __ ] mess i mean who would have imagined some sticky ass cheese being a [ __ ] messy thing to work with i guess that's what you pay for all them [ __ ] terpenes now i don't know how i'm scared to get into this part here man what whoa what's up buddy mama come on [ __ ] what you saying pal hold on let me put this down let me say hello what's up buddy where are you come here there you are give me a little bit oh yeah come say hi to everybody here i'll switch over the camera where is it top camera there we go oh god he used to fit in one hand but it's can a cat i don't want to get him too close to all the sticky stuff but he wanted to say hi i guess hi i want to smell my beard thank you sir tip of the hat tip of the hat for the tips okay get down kitty get down okay i need to freeze these two sections again for a second they are so sticky i need to get them into one so just let me go freeze them again for a second oh actually you know what i can do i got one better i'll bring something cold down foreign okay there we go let me stick that right over i'm going to here that piece over here because that's sort of my storage and this piece right on here all right what's what's going on here i still want birdwood to make a blaster case gun rack he's been straight up playing with the the gun rack blaster rack uh holster quick draw concept for years he's been having a hard time with it to be honest he's gone through a few variations that i've seen um yes i agree i have been keeping my eyes peeled on the local the local uh uh buy sell thing um uh uh about fight it fight it you uh uh too high they're just being pricks it'll come around i swear if you fight it hard enough they'll realize that uh you're not oh ever since i fought hard and actually talked with an employee i mean i'm so grateful but my they've eased up on my [ __ ] a lot ever since i had an actual employee look over my channel they've really eased up my [ __ ] which is shocking let's see if i can get collect this right while it's on this cold thing oh there we go hold on um nope not that one this one there we go yeah holy sticky batman oh hold on hold on [Music] wow [Music] holy crap it's gonna be hard to clean this paper there's a lot of sticky edges like on the back side here there we go let me get those little runners come on don't rip the paper now just work with me there we go and then over here there was some more yeah yeah i want you i won't you don't think you're getting away that easily [ __ ] that you're good sticky you're all coming you're all coming with me i grew up i grew you all summer i'm not gonna waste any if i can help it okay okay now keep in mind i do have to do a second press so you probably got to add about two grams i i'm gonna be very generous and just say two grams uh off my second press and i bet yeah i'll probably get it because uh you almost never when a bit you make a big pouch like that it's rare to get all of your uh stuff in one go now this is actually a really easy way we teach you a really easy way to measure your to measure your concentrates like this that's it that's all you need to do have more paper of equal thickness than what you want now is what you do is you fold if you want to be really really fancy you fold the paper like that right and then we're going to go like this and we're going to trim off this piece of excess now these pieces of paper are the same so if i go like this and cut them like that now these two pieces of paper are same same same same so when i put this piece of paper on here it tears it negatives off that point 19 that that piece of paper weighs and drumroll please ah see i'm gonna definitely have to press that again i'm guessing at least two more on the second press and uh uh i have no filipino on me at all no no filipino hear that folks for everybody that thinks that my wife is a filipino she has none she got a dna test thing done interesting interesting facts but no filipino she gets mistaken for a filipino sometimes which is a bit odd but yep yep nope nope just uh let me grab this thing here i don't have everything all hooked up so it's a little slower to access there we go hello [Laughter] you have to blow it away from him make sure you blow it over there towards the towards the smoke filter things and you got a second toilet to see the hub heat it up right what a suck hole that cat is man holy crap how much did i start with um what was it like i forget now i don't remember i think it was like 13 grams i got the puck here i'm gonna repress it in a second i'm probably gonna get two two or three grams out of the second press still i was shocked the last time i double pressed my hash box at how much you get in there what's that 15.8 yeah so uh there's i better get a lot more that's all i'm saying are you ready to trade the cat for a dab okay you got to put them down i don't want them well i do want him ah no he's just i don't want him near the smoke hey little buddy i'll put you down here i just don't like getting here all the smoke you're still too young for that [ __ ] um i don't know man i've i've been told a good percentage of um i'm also using 37 micron bags if that makes a difference um i don't know i can just go over there and repress it still i suppose and we can take a look it'll be just a little harder harder to uh um actually can you do me a big favor when you go upstairs can you take this and put that up in the freezer i guess i could just put that on there for now that'll do it okay never mind i gotta what is usual percent for you i don't know we have 6.5 yeah i i i've been told and i've read somewhere around 75 percent is is a pretty good percent but um i i don't entirely know holy sticky papers batman there get those things out of here okay i want another dab and then i'm gonna repress that [ __ ] the rest of that i'm not satisfied there's a lot more goop to be had there so let's fricken fold it in half and repress it because i feel like there's probably two or three grams still stashed in that freaking puck somehow and uh that's a lot to that's a lot to [ __ ] just be stuck in a puck man that's a lot i ain't wasting that that's almost half of what i just recovered there so i bet yeah i bet you will well 30 20 20 to 30 increase on on this next press here that's what i think oh and i totally like that was kind of late but actually after looking at a picture of this and how there used to be like a land bridge now what you're saying earlier makes sense yeah i was like i don't get what you're saying [Music] do it right here oh yeah um i was looking at that and then it changed yeah it's a weird weird thing here hold on get in that game come on get in there sorry disorientation everybody give me a second give me a second why not try two bags pressing at the same time um side by side if you have space for them i don't it is kind of narrow yeah my plate my plate had enough for this one puck here i'll show you hold on can you trade me seats honey i need this seat you can take my seat okay i just can't get that yeah the seats on this side of the house so here's the puck side that i used and that's my plate so it's just how it fit my friend hi is it cool if i ask you a question about making seeds uh i don't know much about it but i can try to answer the best i can if you have no scissors please oh sticky scissors yeah everything's sticky sticky sticky every now and then you do actually like clean everything down with a more alcohol wipe because you can clean with other stuff but it'll still stick i found that out from trying to clean the table upstairs yeah i got a cannabis is a thing you gotta really clean up after man you can't you can't clean cannabis with normal soap stuff like the residue from damp really no you need like some alcohol in your house some isopropyl or something like that i should have said smaller bags um oh yeah probably i probably would have been more efficient in hindsight to have done two smaller bags however i wanted to be kind of flashy for youtube and it kind of backfired because now i got to repress it again but to be honest when you're dealing with a hash a second press is not even slightly uncommon that's like what you want to do you want to make sure like you do a second wash when you're making the bubble hash so why wouldn't you do a second press so this is this is my sort of method we got the nice folded pouch and then uh an open see how that works all the pouch goes in here like that one if you're in toronto where is a good bean company or who's a good bean company um well there's a lot of good companies out there um one good one is um what's it called there um you know what i'm gonna let chat i'm gonna let chad answer that i believe there's like weird legalities about talking about where to get cannabis on on youtube and and and youtube seems to think i'm selling drugs and stuff if i give out too much information so chat can say i can't control check jack can do whatever the [ __ ] they can say words all they want and that's not me doing it so i'm gonna let you guys just deal with that because mr crotch has a good example yeah there's a couple of really good ones in around it depends where you live and you live in canada you've got lots of good options but or or should i say mate because i don't know who's that who asked that i don't know but bob who was asking if you could use two bags which say it just says thanks i was just curious two bags i feel like even more is gonna get hung up inside of it i feel like one bags if you've got good strong bags you should be good with a single bag can i ask you a nerdy question no this is not nerdy question time i don't care i'm just kidding go ahead for the denisovans oh i don't know he asked me that stuff after okay we'll we'll go over that stuff like this wrong topic love i know you're i know you're all super hyped up about your freaking uh uh dna results and we'll we'll we'll discuss after the stream oh i didn't say anything about me and that was just talking about that no no i know i'm just saying that um we can we'll figure that out afterwards i don't know oh i gotta clean this through oh cat you're stepping on my hair thank you for getting off my hair okay here we go now one of the things you could do at this point is i could like have maybe increased increased the uh uh the temperature a little bit that's a thing i i potentially could have done when you're folding bags you've got to be a little more cautious about not putting too much pressure too quickly or too much pressure period um as you will blow them out that fold will explode if you put too much pressure on there i can't say will like guaranteed but like uh most most likely boring what's going on here where's the freaking where's the [ __ ] lava slide we're not going to get no lavish one folks i know that but we're definitely gonna get some return i guess i could turn this up by five degrees on each plate right here while i'm sitting here i don't know if it'll make it if it'll get much warmer by the time uh i'm done but who knows who i got i just found my coffee i forgot about for the last like bit here how about ya hannah is on your hair yes he is actually i'm gonna press um this button there he goes can you heat me up uh or hear this pass it to me oh god that was i shouldn't reach with that arm [ __ ] i should just say i should have let you pass it to me it's hard to accept help sometimes folks it's [ __ ] true man it's weird accepting help for stupid little things from your little tiny wife carrying your groceries and stuff it's weird man it's a weird way to be sometimes but when your nerve damage is flaring up and your [ __ ] arms are killing you whatever man you got to do what you got to do i suppose but it's not uh not the most manly feeling in the universe sometimes i tell you that oh well it's okay to be a little humble it's good for the soul and it's mrs crouch today holy what oh there we go i don't know how to answer that because what's that no difference if i use a photo period to pollinate an autoflower or should i use an autoflower to pollinate an autoflower yes always try to use the thing that you want to pollinate the thing that you want or you're going to get some weird hybrid that might act funny if i think he was just asking it's like would it turn into an autofocus i don't know super well um i know that's kind of how you push things into autoflowers is if you're trying to make an autoflower out of a photo period from my understanding that's how you do it but you might have to do that you might have to do that a couple of times the cat has found a plastic cap thing and he's going to be making an awful racket so if you're wondering what that weird racket is i love watching him just yeah he just found this little thing and he is [ __ ] in love with it okay give it one there we go that's all the pressure i'm gonna give it any more than that i i fear bag blow out i can however see goop that's not that gwyneth paltrow goop either [ __ ] that [ __ ] i'm talking about that i don't know much about it but i've seen just a tiny little bit and i'm like nobody wants a candle that smells like my dick nobody wants a candle that smells like her freaking no they had wow [ __ ] stickers that like repel psychic vampires or stickers or something but i'm like okay oh my god okay you okay it's great it's like it's good satire but it's like spooky because people actually buy that [ __ ] they think i don't know if they think it's real or if they're just buying it by the pure i know people that were trying to buy that freaking her candle her her her v candle let's say her vajayjay candle um was uh uh tried we tried to purchase it as a joke for somebody in the community they want like [ __ ] a hundred dollars for her freaking her v candle [ __ ] that it's not even worth a joke if it was like 40 bucks or 50 bucks or something we would have bought one for the pure hilarity of sending that to somebody but a hundred bucks we're not [ __ ] rich that's crazy it's i'm just you could buy fake ones bootleg fake ones that just say vagina candle on them from from etsy that don't actually smell like a freaking tuna for like [ __ ] 20 bucks so i don't know i i know it's not the official gwyneth paltrow one but [ __ ] hell man 100 bucks anyway i'm not here to talk about that we're here to talk about this kind of goop oh we had some blowout look at that the bag exploded see out the back look at that what did i [ __ ] say now i don't know if the pouch exploded or just the bag let me see here no the pouch is okay the pouch is okay folks now if i had the gas here we got about a gram and a half um how do i press that button bye bye okay here honey can you trade any seats again i think miss gross is going in yeah i want to go through because i want to be dry i'm almost done here i like that that thing disappears after a little bit if it's freaking not working i mean it's a little spooky because you didn't actually switch it and if you weren't prepared keep a tight tight freaking a tight grip on your robe there lover you're gonna give people one hell of a show you know what i should cost mine that should cost money yikes okay okay let's see what i can which i can round up my phone i just got over here oh sorry thank you for joining love i'll be done soon okay okay okay okay boom um here i'm gonna tilt the camera just a little bit that way don't judge me i'm using a piece of frozen cheese why do i have frozen cheese because i'm a [ __ ] weirdo i don't eat very much cheese but i want when i want to make [ __ ] lasagna i want to make [ __ ] lasagna all right don't judge me the wife is uh lactose intolerant so we don't need a whole lot of cheese in this house so whenever it goes on sale i tend to buy some and freeze it because i only kind of cook with it was the biggest flattest frozen thing i could find i know it's kind of a weird thing but you know whatever i'm just grating it all up and melting the [ __ ] anyway so it's all good probably not but i don't care don't judge me i also thought it was i'll be honest i also thought it was kind of funny that i i actually grabbed a block of cheese and this is cheese ah i tell ya i am playing 4d chess sometimes you guys just never know about it i don't even know about it half the time but apparently i am okay so i think i was maybe if i squished it again in a sort of a different manner flatten it out and re-squished it or something i might get a little bit more but i'm starting to think maybe more along the lines of a gram and a half return i think my two to three grams might have been a little bit prematurely optimistic that's all i'm thinking [Music] anybody in chat remember how much i got on this first blob before we started smoking on it because we've been smoking on it so i don't want to add it to that i want to add this to the original weight i forgot i think it was like i don't know i want to say it was like five grams or something five and a half grams oh [ __ ] i just tore it with that on there so yeah that's five grams there so i think it was about five and a half just five on the point [ __ ] [Music] that's not very much man yeah we got about a gram and a half here probably folks that's my guess okay so same basic deal except i'm gonna be a little sloppier about it and just go like that it's pretty [ __ ] close 1.5 grams it's a it's a gram folks it's a gram so i got about half a little a little tiny less than half of my return on that i'm not very impressed i mean it tastes [ __ ] really good but i'm not super impressed with uh this strain was kind of weird too now to be honest there wasn't uh this strain was really weird it it was not big big big buds but it was nice clusters and it was really [ __ ] stinky ass still very stinky ass uh where is a clean piece of parchment right there i'm gonna go with that there we go i'll get that in there good no god damn i did the wrong way i gotta get my hand warm on this side and it cold on the bottom for it to separate that's the trick i always forget the side you want it to stick on is the side you want to get warm with your hand and you put the side you want to separate it from on the cold plate and then you can in theory god dang it it's not doing it very well oh [ __ ] it's not ready yet in theory i know here put it on i'll put it on the cheese there we go different strains provide different yields this is very true there was like no way i was going to get like a a a specific there we go a specific percentage on this return like if i didn't get 75 percent i didn't do it right kind of thing or something like that so that was never really in the cards and i mean long story short that is a [ __ ] pretty delicious blob of [ __ ] cheese [ __ ] hash rosin right there you know now as i was saying i was saying that we're gonna do a nice big fat dab at the end here with the uh uh with a terp bead come on come on bead yeah there you little booger okay i'll take that one i don't care a bead's a bead you just stick right there would you yeah sure will thank you um put that thing aside over there and that aside over there and i need to bring this one here front and center like that so thank you all for hanging out here today i hope you did enjoy my live squish stream i've been promising doing a squish stream for quite a while uh i'll be honest this was not the best return um so i will do this again i like this this was a this went fairly smooth as far as being able to transition from the actual dab camera back to the desk and and whatnot um once i get a little [ __ ] mini freezer down here we'll be [ __ ] set um but in the time being let's get a nice [ __ ] slice of this cheese here or like holy [ __ ] what is going on here god dang that's a freaking beard hair [ __ ] you beard hair i spotted you you son of a [ __ ] i'm like that doesn't look right okay come on a little more a little more come on there we go oh i just squished it against the side of the glass oh party file party foul okay whatever whatever it's all over the ding thing here hold on let me switch cameras there we go come on center properly there we go i could probably take a bit bigger dab than that [ __ ] this come on now come on now this is for youtube's sake here let me move the glass so i don't [ __ ] break it i feel like i'm being wussy because of that glass there we go there we go i got a bigger blob on there there we go i feel better about that now okay i'm gonna stick that right there and then my bead is right no oh you son of a [ __ ] oh my god what the [ __ ] hell what the [ __ ] is wrong this stuff is so sticky [ __ ] it rolled on me and just [ __ ] son of a [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] i'm gonna say it a bunch god damn i'm just covering up the mess with a piece of paper [ __ ] god damn it i hate it when they roll like that um people are going to get all mad at me because i said god damn it god damn it i don't mean any god dang disrespect don't be like that when you're frustrated you just say words don't be freaking thinking i'm all whatever anyway that dang it god dang it gosh dang it gosh dang it that's what i'm gonna start saying i gotta say gosh dang it sounds so [ __ ] stupid i don't wanna say that that's dumb okay just freaking don't be so freaking gosh dang sensitive because i don't mean any oh my god dude this is becoming a train wreck i just touched it with my finger okay [ __ ] you seriously go over there get the [ __ ] away from me this stuff is so sticky it's just becoming a [ __ ] mess okay i want to get dabbed out here quickly before i [ __ ] destroy everything uh is it lagging for anyone else europe is having a bit of lag problems and i'm hoping it's just you need to refresh brother refresh and make sure that you've hit the dab or dabbed that like button it's probably lagging it is lagging oh no it doesn't look like it's lagging on mine mine let me look at my stream health here it is giving me an excellent status with zero freaking hiccups on my end hmm but if you guys are saying it's giving you some freaking some hiccups then it's hiccuping man i believe you i don't know youtube's weird oh man i got freaking stuff i could see a freaking dab string just stuck here against my thing there we go i got it though freaking hell it's everywhere there we go so as i was saying in in past discussions grab your terp bead with your dab if i had any freaking cbd down here i probably put some in here once i melt this in here i'll try to switch cameras i'll get the um thing here so i just press a button there is a pretty wicked windstorm attacking uh uh eastern bc and western alberta right now that is very true okay folks here we go here we go so oh holy [ __ ] that looked way smaller way bigger on camera that was plus got all that build up and it was just like all right i can't go off like that i'll have a [ __ ] big fat dab blaster dab that was too much work for that little dab i mean i'll tell you one thing that tasted [ __ ] delicious for real that was [ __ ] um i want to pair it with some coffee i do love that [ __ ] combo of weed and coffee is a wonderful thing but uh man those those terp beads really do do that justice is they aerosolize they really help uh uh uh boost it into a freaking into uh uh [Music] it's the word i'm looking for into a gas a vapor if you will i'm sorry some of you are lagging it must be my connection a little bit then okay let's go out with a freaking normal a proper big dab that is one of the reasons i truly love um the dab blaster here folks and i'm not just trying just a hundred percent trying to pitch and i'm trying to pitch it a little bit because it's got my face on it and i'm trying to pitch it a little bit because it's my bros design and i want my bro to succeed so of course i'm going to help my bro out right and try to give them some sponsors or some some free freaking public publicity that's the word yep whatever uh so dabblaster.ca folks uh you can use the code uh there's codes below uh uh can a beard for a discount uh bam it's got beautiful bunny on one side a beard on the other and uh one of the things i love about this thing is you can really really really control your dab you can have like a little one little puff or you can have a big old fat ripper it's up to you look there we go a good like medium high ripper there we go and that took like how quick was that it's just like heat it let it cool down a second [ __ ] hit it you're high anyway once again dab blaster dot ca and you can get these cool special editions that got my face on it somehow like this i always have a hard time trying to line it up but it's somewhere around there anyway um there's also other editions you can get that just got cool print on them that don't have my stupid face uh that kind of stuff too but uh if you want the discount you gotta get you gotta get my special editions that's the way she works it's freaking promotion get it um [Music] you do get really good reclaim uh i'm trying to currently figure out what to do with my massive reclaim collection in harder times in between grows i smoke on this stuff but i literally have [Music] where is it here look at this i literally have jars of reclaim i don't know what to do with this [ __ ] i i seriously need to like i want to like i want to like i want to dump it all into [ __ ] like uh uh ether or something like that and mix it all and kind of winterize it and kind of put it through a filter and then i'll have a cleaner product and then i can do something with it then i can eat it you can smoke it again i don't know what to do with it man it's [ __ ] good stuff technically there's a lot of good in it i just don't know how to refine it to a more palatable state because uh reclaim tastes like [ __ ] everything you [ __ ] cook with reclaimed tastes like [ __ ] uh i just tend to smoke it first generation reclaim okay to smoke past that it gets pretty gross it's just like roaches man first generation roaches decent powerful second generation roaches tastes like ashy [ __ ] and you know it uh yeah see i've done that uh that's actually the very first place uh todd miles makes a good point he's talking about making capsules of coconut oil like mct oil and eating them and stuff that's a hundred percent the first place i went with this i'm like i got all this [ __ ] how can i i'm like i know if i warm up a little bit of mct oil in a [ __ ] pan and then scoop a couple of grams of this [ __ ] black tar freaking reclaim this [ __ ] thing and stir it up long enough it'll all it'll all congeal and become one and become gravy and it did and then we put them up into it made a bunch of whole bunch of caps it was amazing we didn't get too sticky doing it but we literally did it um uh uh uh but uh here's the problem they taste like [ __ ] and they give you the worst burps ever they give you really bad burps you you taste so bad have a good one colleen and uh yep uh that's probably never gonna happen until the laws change uh due to current laws i can only ever kind of joke and and and sort of like there are some videos out there there's enough videos out there for you to be able to make somewhat informed decisions on making shatter and i'm sorry i i cannot be a part of teaching anyone in a current climate due to just the way the laws are it's wacky wacky wacky wacky um you can kind of do it for yourself legally under the medical reasons but past that uh yeah you gotta be careful man the laws are still weird about that it's okay to have pot and everything but some of the things you could do with pot are like we don't know about that we don't understand that so they're like hesitant again health canada acnpr tends to supersede a lot of those little sub-laws and allow you to kind of just do whatever the [ __ ] you want kinda look into it please don't just be [ __ ] silly and do whatever you want but that's the reality have a good one

what's up with it son be closet mad grower oh and of course your big homie mr. big Dukey and we're back yet again for another harvest video this time were focused on the ghost og yet again this one was grown under the duo luck 600 by top-shelf light comp that lie right there and as you can see my LED town is finally empty and needs to be cleaned up so let's get back to the harvest so to continue things back over here you could see this was the last plant my LED tent it was flowered into number 2 pot and this is the heirloom ghost OG cut and this stuff came out incredibly frosty nice tight knuckly buds looking like an OG should so super super frost levels a little stretchy not the best bud spacing or colas but the actual bud size is not bad a lot of golf ball buds all throughout it that I'm gonna be able to smoke so sounds good to me this plant has a really musky diesel e kenny kind of smell to it as as they're supposed to not as much it chemi more of a diesel musky maybe a hint of lemon in the background and that's that's how the OGIS are supposed to smell so pretty sure this is in fact a very legit cut of ghost OG and looks great so I'm happy to have harvested it and I think I will definitely make sure I do at least one or two more runs of it let's get one more close up on this fat but see if we can get in and really look at some trichomes there we go looking good so that's what I got for flower harvest just that side and realistically if we look at the whole tent this is my whole LED tent harvest this round so not so bad but let's disregard the Smurf berry for this video we're focused on the ghost and as we come down here you can see I got a few little buds down in the corner that fell off this one's actually pretty nice little chunker here but I trim them up that you know fell off during harvest so I trimmed them up and they're just going to dry out down there in the box this is the trim I got this is going to go in my freezer to be fresh frozen and I'm going to do that probably make some bubble hash with this batch I think my goal is to take the ghost trim and once I harvest the LA og in about a week I'm going to take that trim and mix them together and then run it into a batch of OG bubble hash so that's what I got going for that structure as you can see it was a little stretchy but I you know bent it down I lest eat it into the net to make it fit in my scrog and it did a pretty good job I had it in a number two pot and yeah that's about it let's take a look at some roots see these roots came out pretty good actually fairly thick all throughout they're not bad webbing on the bottom a little light and you can see some of the some of the dirt ripped up a little bit but overall not bad whatsoever like me some good healthy roots those look pretty decent so yep happy growing for me happy harvesting and that puts me in a pretty good mood actually so let's get just a couple more close-ups and we'll get on out of here say you had a faint amount of purple on this bud - looking really really nice though so I'm excited to get smoking on this this little sieve and the lowers our golf balls I literally I didn't put any larf buds into my trim at all even the lower lowest nugs on this even though they had smaller size so I'd okay structure so I ended up saving every bit of this to convert over into bud and none of it went into the large trim so only sugar trim down there all right y'all time to get on out of here that's it for our ghost og so if you like that harvest definitely make sure you go check out some of the more this is some more of them I just posted this video recently and subscribe for more content so hit that thumbs up and let's get on out of here it's then B closet my grower and look at where mr. big dukey's

toke you're not just granted you know a nice smooth piece that you feel like you're drawing air is great but you know I just like that extra substance so put a little bit more water in there yeah I'm

smoking on today I went the kind love yesterday as you guys know and I picked up that alien rock candy bud and i also got that lemon boss there as well the same time I i formulated my plan and i decided to pick up another grandma some hash yesterday it's some flake and unfortunately whenever I you know look through their selection and I saw what I wanted they they had both butter which was kind of like how the lemon boss was you know very full and you know you could see it as one giant piece whereas this flake is of course really flaky and kind of hard to get on a dabber so you kind of got to scoop it but it's it's still phenomenal the strain is called ghost train A's number five it's pretty much a god a tutti frutti type flavor to it oh [ __ ] um yeah it tastes really tropical like like a pi\u00f1a colada [ __ ] alright i needa stop dropping down to everywhere it's delicious I love it I am so glad I picked it up but like I was standing like downside is it's it's the flake so as you saw it's quite a bit of a creamy ass to handle and dish out but we make it work because you know why we're stoners and that's what we do here all right so let's get that going a little bit more oh no I don't want to die yeah Yello all right so we got that going let's make sure we're in focus we are not now we are sweet I guess when I was tearing that [ __ ] with my hand the camera was like no you're gonna get out of course so of course we got to surf we got the car cap we got Shazam and Cyborg chillin on over there making sure we don't do anything crazy but as you know we sometimes things to do that here on Jan so I have thought about the contest i believe i might do like a guess the grams org rest and guessing number you know something like that something so everybody can participate

Hayes number five oh yeah if you guys have ever been to the beach or any kind of coastal city you've gotten saltwater taffy it's got that kind of salty oh not really salty but you know that's sweet

about all of their how swags that kind love comes at under 100 parts per million that's [ __ ] awesome he said most of them you can come in in single digits which is even you know that that's what you should expect from a top-of-the-line MMC exam a good dispensary that takes care of their customers they take care of their loyal you know patients that that's it just makes me feel good inside you

solvent with santa claus rock and roll just not for christmas and it is my birthday so i'm gonna have to get it to have a turkey birthday and uh celebrate here and uh there we go these we can dab out up to you right here these are mine these are mine so wow just the ones that didn't make it damn [ __ ] insane doesn't it look insane it literally looks like i like the uh the banana macking door it looks like that same [ __ ] well that's outdoor and that's whole spectrum we can do that yeah let's do that awesome [ __ ] yeah yeah that is the best pipe right now i've been [ __ ] around with this tower with the thing on it and it is actually super intense this way so with the banger on it didn't work but this thing this way it works very well uh jim you have a pipe too yeah and you have two um wands huh sweet jim saves the day together we have a whole set i have two pipes uh and and one and one no no no it's good that you have the two because i'll break it or lose it and i do have two but i break something again yeah i did i stepped on it and broke up i threw it on the ground yeah i was already on the floor yeah thank god um all right so direct in contact with the coils onto the glass and so you do it with um does that work too with like the sticks too where you just put it you can we did remember we did it we did it yeah we did a temperature test on his on the sticks that he uh last time he was doing it on my switch jesus it broke you can't the thing to stay on damn broke in my backpack from being just in there tossing around yeah so you can hold the button on the back now you have to hold it there so this one doesn't have where it works all the time so i have to use a lighter yeah but i don't mind that still is completely functioning torch mode for me yeah mine's not probably functioning torch mode except for when your thumb's on i got this one from frankie because he didn't like having to use the lighter so i was thinking about the book too so what were we planning on covering maybe like what we cover in the class well so honestly i mean that's really up to you i was also thinking though for real there might like when we first started heli bank right in 2018 we just wanted to like see if i personally want to see if there's any literature out so i bought the only book that i found that was a rosin book and it isn't it was a piece of [ __ ] it was a stupid [ __ ] i think we talked about it so we focus on rosin a little bit more it just it like it talked about like kind of the idea of rosin before no one's really put no paper what raw like techniques of ross in and like information information for somebody to grab on how to make surprises and straight up no one has put up the whole process to how to make good rather than why they're bronzing is coming out black and white they were literally making like bro like brown rose and they're like yeah and that's a lot we can cover on that too exactly literally just on um on like product quality cured versus not here there's a book there but to go into everything that you teach in the newest class like the solvent that's why what i sent you was the trichome textbook the idea is just like how to really like you're going to make it into a whole like it's going to be a series that would be like a 100 book that's what i thought was a big fat book 60 to 100 or something like that it'd be fat somebody that really actually wants to do this is gonna invest 60 is like you know i feel like it wouldn't even that would not like give honor or whatever the [ __ ] to the amount of information we're gonna try and the time that we're gonna put into it but it'll make it accessible to people so that's the only reason i put yeah number there but i'm not like stuck on those numbers i'd be 100 willing to be like no we're saying 100 so only people that really [ __ ] want this information are going to buy it i guess that really will determine on how much we want to invest in it making it like well that's controller-wise picture-wise it's gonna have to be that's the thing yeah it's gonna have to be like the best [ __ ] be exactly depending on how much money we invest in it to do it um we'll really directly relate what we're gonna have to charge for it exactly and honestly though you know if we worked with the right kind of people there are definitely someone in publishing there's somebody in publishing that would be interested in this that could actually that has the right you know whatever the [ __ ] if we were to try to really make it really nice you know and stuff i don't know because also i'm not sure entirely the scale to which you you know you want to make this because i am very into trying to help people to make the best medicine they can you know and putting a book out i think it's the best idea i think that's a good idea i've been i thought about it for three days after that that's all i could think about in the background i think it's a really good idea for us i think for for the people for hash community like you said yeah there really isn't very much information out there for you to get told at all i've been trying i tried to buy books on it too when i started and it's there's really not anything out there it's good it gives you any good no one that's doing it has spent the time to explain to you their techniques really is the thing totally that's it no one's actually they're either doing it or they're not you know and so um no that's it for real and yeah i think it's a great idea i think what we could do is i mean i don't know what your plan was on it we would just split everything that we make on it in half oh totally yeah and then well i know you're always not worried about money because you're [ __ ] afraid oh don't worry about everything's great we'll just but we really should figure it out a little bit like so [Laughter] it knows me for real yeah i think it's really like everything's fine it'll be all great but no but for real though like i so we just split everything we make and what we do is i guess i'm pretty much what i'm expecting is i'm pretty much gonna have to finance anything that we do well no that's the thing honestly to be 100 with you i would actually just gear all of the production i put in like i've been putting a lot of money into the studio and uh my teeth for a while last year was paying for [ __ ] surgery and [ __ ] like that but i make a good decent bit i just like to project it towards something so like i've been putting my money towards my camera and stuff i'm saving for a better lens and [ __ ] like that so it's like that's thousands blah blah blah i'd rather seriously we're going to focus on the book that's why when i texted you i think i said something 2021 sounds to me like i'll focus a lot of energy on that yeah i think that's gonna be amazing because i think there's a lot of you there you're adding a lot of value to it on how much you'll you'll focus on it too straight up totally dude so um what we'll do is we'll just split everything um like what we would do what i was thinking is um 50 50 on on all our outgoing costs yeah and then 50 50 on whatever we make on it totally and then whatever we could especially if you have some funds on it we'll be able to split that up and be able to finance it i would imagine fairly you know um decent i don't know how much we don't need to spend a ton of money i don't think to make it but it would be definitely going to cost some money to be able to get it published and to be able to get it printed um and i think that um i mean we're probably not going to make very much money on it but maybe in the long run we will and uh i think it'll really give us not really the word credibility i would say because we don't really need i don't really need credibility right but in the sense that the emerald cup winning gave me credibility it will do that it'll solidify my our teaching of it i think in the sense that like uh people will want to learn from us more have more access to want to know to learn from us have the ability to find out information and pass our information on to other people and get our information just out there definitely all right cheers in the book cheers i have one question for frank after this one in regards to what you were saying with publishing and talk that tastes like fruit no it is fruit what was that one that was the secret orgasm happened wow fruit pollution yeah it's like those phenols that they did this year they killed three or four different oh yeah there was there was a lemon head and then there's there's limited seat four i think oh okay i'm confusing it all right there's eliminated 48 lemon head like seven so you're right yeah yeah okay two women had ziddles okay and then there was lemon head they used to otherwise elsewhere that's what i think you're remembering because i've seen that we did that too but that [ __ ] tastes better oh wow second that read actually it's ridiculous that's so that's the technique i'm gonna do i don't know about consistency but i've been really refining my washes and that's how it got cleaner i feel and i'm gonna this is what i'm gonna replicate for the cup and just sweet for the lemonade zittles c4 so just to break it down you took the fresh press and then it let it butter and then whipped it crushed it would play it you had bird tech yep yep i just pretty much did bird check to it i filled the jar up shut the jar and then um slowly let it let it just warm up and then you divide the grams after that yep after i day after it has to sit for a day because sometimes it'll like dry a layer or like look dry because you didn't remove all the oxygen out it's like almost impossible to sometimes some strains is that the bubbles in the fresh press uh i think a lot of that is that but it's it's also just when when you have hash cure it is gonna have holes in it from from the curing process god that shit's good yeah that is a [ __ ] very uh unique program [ __ ] good isn't it yeah is that what it is it's the lemon that i'm feeling oh that's so good i hope i replicated just like that for my tough entries because i think that is a good chance to win the motor breath is that's i'm going with whatever that's why is that the whole plant that you talked about harvesting no i haven't watched that yet oh jesus christ well that's exciting i haven't watched any of that yet yeah wow that makes sense yeah that must be ridiculous that's gonna be ridiculous yeah wow and i'm gonna watch all that and then i'm gonna watch the stuff that my wife made at our house i grew up in our house too she's like an ice cream cake by white mango oh [ __ ] oh wow that's crazy what the [ __ ] is that gonna be know i'll watch that that might be the fourth one i entered for the cup wow how it turns out i just haven't decided what my fourth entry will be mango cake wow that's awesome wouldn't that be cool and nice day for a white mango wedding nice day for a while my wedding yeah yeah that would be good that is amazing that is the white wedding yeah so so yeah that's what i have to do to that to get it to cure like that though because sometimes like even this one right here it's it's not as wet as it would be if i crushed it down one more time whoa so if you had done that with the whole i did the whole run you're saying like all the way together if you would continue one like sometimes like this lemonade settles if you just crush it down once it's like so derpy and so like its own weight kind of helped you do that process and it was like so so like uh um the um the viscosity of it was was was less of like thinner viscosity so that when you crush it it's helping you do that process it's where if you got like a thicker denser mask there's gonna be harder to actually crush it a hundred percent down and perfectly without still being voids and still sometimes hash kind of cures again like it just takes a second you know like you you think it's all done caring and and you crush it down and it'll look wet and then the next day you'll open the jar up and it will be dry looking because it's still needed a little bit more time too and like because like gravity kind of crushes it down on itself too you know so the viscosity of it i think is what plays a role because when the viscosity is thinner like this lemon head zibbles you just crush it once it'll be fine it'll stay wet the next day it's only when the scarcity is a thicker viscosity when you're pressing it or any you know what i mean like if you can grab your gloves and it's easy to grab your gloves that's like usually a thicker viscosity um like if it's if it's so thin like you try to grab with your gloves it'll like smear on your gloves so like that viscosity is going to lend you to easier crush it down and get that process you're trying to achieve to happen because what you're trying to do is just remove all the air it's doing that for you in a gravity sense in its sense of how it's laying its terps you know what i mean so like a denser one as it cures and the thc binds with itself in there it's gonna be like crystallized and the terps won't be like washing them off like kind of like interpreting making it really derpy so some some strains i have like that happen faster and some take longer and it's when it's terpier the viscosity is higher it takes longer because the thc account buying through it is easy it's like terpier and so you'll have to crush those down a couple times sometimes so you'll want to wait a couple of days if you see it at room temperature for two days sit like that terpe you know it's not going to change whoa okay you know what i mean but if you make a jar big ass jar like 20 grams or whatever i crush it all down and i see if i go and i come and open it the next in two days and it's it's dry then it wasn't done i gotta crush it down again and now if i was to put it all out and portion it all up then you wouldn't be able to redo that so you got to do it all right and have it where it i would say two days is a sufficient time sometimes you can do it within a day you could definitely tell within a day what it's going to kind of happen if it if it's going to be a dryer it'll have changed a little in a day if it's not going to stay freezer that was my question yeah freezer or yeah yeah i i so the freezer is going to slow your preserving when you put it in the freezer so you're going to slow this process down so it's going to take longer for you to be able to tell anything so like when i'm trying to find out if i'm trying to make something wet like a whipped consistency then i'm really i'm very i'm leaving it at room temperature for it to happen and that happens a lot faster than like a temple ball if you take it and age it in a refrigerator you're stopping the process of making the temple by preserving it inside so you don't want to do that to make a temple just like when you make wine you don't store wine in a refrigerator you store wine in a wine cellar and that's because wine is fermenting just like the temple ball is so you don't want your temple on the refrigerator nor would you want to put something refrigerator that you're trying to achieve a consistency if it is over a time process so if it's going to take you so that would take a longer time to do it and you could probably figure out on how to do it that way with time but you're gonna have to like probably wait a week or something before you can come back and get it to achieve the same thing it would achieve sitting out for a day just like making wine if you put in a fridge it might make wine but it's gonna take forever it's not going to make wine like it does it normally because it needs that that somewhat of a ability to not be in a frozen state or preserved state so that it can happen so like if i was trying to make fresh pressed i put it in a freezer directly after i press it now by doing that it locks it all in to stay clear longer at room temperature afterward but considerably longer if i don't take the fresh press and put in the freezer right away the thc can start binding and it will in the freezer it'll just take longer but it can still happen but if you don't let it ever bind and you froze it right away when it was still translucent like right after you pull it off the press it it froze those thc crystals in in state before they could find each other so it takes longer for them to find each other because it's this thick ass dense oily mask that you put it into now and it's all cooled down because it's in a freezer so it's going to take a long time for it to get to that side and body with itself on a molecular chemical level wow so yeah so you can like make fresh press last longer like if i want if i want to make it have a better shelf life that's what you have to do you have to put in a freezer and funny me and bloodsmith both found this out separately testing separately and both came to the same conclusion separately without talking to each other and then talk to each other about it afterward and both had tried this and found out that yes if you put your first freshly pressed fresh pressed in the freezer right away and then you portion it up that's the one of the reasons we found it i found it was because you can't portion fresh press very well and it doesn't look very good if it's not perfectly like in a jar nice coin in my mind so if you put in a freezer right away you can take it out of the freezer and break it into chunks and in a cold room even if it's really gooey [ __ ] you have a tiny bit like a minute that you can shatter all your trunks up get your grams weighed up and you can even like throw it right back in the freezer if you need two per second it's like really going to be strained and pull right back out and you'll have enough time to like squeeze it into a ball kind of then you can put it in your jar and what happened was i started doing that and i had leave left in the freezer overnight so i wasn't going to prepare it until the next day that's when i started finding it out and then putting two and two together and trying it to work noticing if i put my fresh press in the freezer right away for like at least a few hours to fully fully freeze if the whole hour dense puck however long it would take to fully freeze that maybe eight hours depending on how big of a chunk you did you know maybe 10 hours but fully freeze it then pull it out portion it up you could after you portion it up you could leave that jar at room temperature and it will take considerably longer for it to butter up than if you didn't do that if you didn't leave it for you if i never put in the freezer oh okay like or if i grab them all up like if i pressed the rosin and then grabbed all the rosin up and then like let's say finally got it into the freezer hours later that would still take that butter up way faster than if you put in the freezer right after pressing it because you freeze that state right away before the th that's like right when it's translucent that thc has not valid itself yet and that that's why it's not cured at all yet there's no whiteness to it so you need to freeze it in that state immediately then you can grab it up later after it's been fully froze and then you can pull it out and put it at room temperature and it would take way longer to to turn to fresh press or to turn to a cold cured than if you just press some rosin grabbed it up and put it out that stuff would turn to cold cure right away right away there's something about that it finds itself if you let it just be gooey warm and then cool down and then even put into a refrigerator it doesn't like freeze the state even if you grab it all up put in a refrigerator that's not going to achieve it you gotta press your oven put it in the freezer right away the way i do it is i put it on parchment paper and i fold the parchment paper into like a a pouch and then put in a ziplock bag a freezer a freezer bag and then freeze it right away and then i'll pull that out and break it into chunks and then that's how you can actually manage it to where it's it's a manageable piece like a ball and then push it into a jar like a perfect coin because you made a ball first and then you put the ball in the coin and you can push that ball out into and if your room's cold it doesn't really matter how gooey it is especially if it's like fully frozen you have a little bit of time to kind of get to manipulate it play with it so that's just one technique and trick i i have done that i can for sure say is significantly uh extends the shelf life of fresh frozen staying as fresh frozen versus it turning to a cold cure it'll give you a longer shelf life of it staying translucent it'll last longer as translucent like if i pull a jar in the fridge i mean it's no joke because i was wondering because the uh the lemonhead skittles that i just bought most or actually i'm sorry motorhead fresh pressed that stuff stayed fresh pressed out of the fridge for a long time it could be that it's cold in here but for a minute yeah that's one of the things that i've noticed is when you do that it'll it'll lengthen the time that you get it as fresh press well that's badass it's cool to be able to do that because people like having it as fresh press and it's really hard to give that to somebody because it create changes right away like if you don't try to do something to it right if you don't at least freeze it right away it won't stay like that i just now know that you've explained this too i just now have realized the difference in the rosins that i've been getting where they were either fresh frozen or cold cured so it was just now that i just realized those two different consistencies kind of well so like um then uh bud smith's thing he um his looks similar they're both buttered nicely but his was fresh pressed one is fresh frozen and one of them is is cold cure and that's actually where you kind of see this they're both fresh frozen fresh frozen they're both fresh pressed too though yeah buttsmith only does fresh i believe yeah right that's all yeah okay then when you say the cold cure it to it so but smith whenever you get something from him it's going to be frozen first like i just explained to you yeah because he's making it uh to sell out as or to be used as fresh pressed um now whenever you just take a jar fresh press it's eventually going to turn itself what you would like to call maybe cold cured because it is sat into a cold room after it had been fresh pressed so now would be called cold cured right wouldn't be considered whip because he doesn't remove the oxygen from it no one actually whips anything there's no actual whipping going on especially and [Laughter] we know he's not whipping anything but yeah so then it'll have a different texture and and i i feel like a cold cured fresh pressed gram is going to deteriorate and break down faster than if you would have crushed the oxygen out of it and allowed the terpenes to actually separate from the rosin in a sense of peanut butter doing that with the oil that's mixed into peanut butter and preserving it and allowing oxygen not to permeate through and actually break down the rosin so i don't agree or like or think anyone should promote cold cured i think cold cured in in my mind would be one step away from making it correct would be removing the oxygen from it so you're actually one step away from doing a really good job so if i explain if i understand this correctly the the bird tech is the crushing right and then the whipping it is literally it like literally they would almost they would look identical if people just look at them so your tech though actually preserves it and makes it last longer whereas this one is exposing the action doing the exact opposite what you're talking about exactly so intense so i do understand it yeah okay so that is so crazy and when you first explained that to me i was overwhelmed because all the whip stuff is what everybody posts online and it's called whipped and what you're doing looks like that but it's the more intellectual actual functional part yeah we're like breaking it down a little bit on what we want to achieve and what should be done to to make the process of it um lengthen shelf life and make it better and it's in its process and people are just trying to achieve a better color they're not trying to to think further ahead right that's the problem last longer it's just gonna be a color for the day okay they buy it it looks sweet right there had this like really cool consistency with these like filled it full of deteriorating pieces of oxygen you know very fragile yeah exactly exposed so like like think about it egg if you made like a really good like i don't know what it is like like it's like a souffle or something right when they're like the dude's like folding the [ __ ] the cream like the phone right he's like folding it in like what if you were just over there beating the [ __ ] out of his phone that he just made and you're like just whipping the [ __ ] out of it he would lose his [ __ ] mind right he'd come over and slap the [ __ ] out of you yeah you know hey he's like what the [ __ ] did you just [ __ ] do to that [ __ ] foam i just made you just thought you'd whip it like a slave master they just whip the [ __ ] out of it it's ridiculous i see videos of that [ __ ] you know who does it really bad as blue river turps oh really i see like he has those tall jars like those big tall ones they're like this big around yeah and the whole jar will be like you could tell you've been whipping because it'll be whipped [ __ ] all over the jar i don't have like this much in the bottom of the jar yeah that time they're [ __ ] just whipping the [ __ ] and it's white as [ __ ] [ __ ] let me tell you it looks [ __ ] gorgeous expected they turned it into butter though wow and so this shit's gonna break down rapidly and it's gonna taste like [ __ ] from the inside out i mean come on there's no way around it wow so that you have to you have to think about what's happening like also i mean we should i mean i have a really access to a really good microscope at the farm i should probably be doing some more um studying and figuring out things with the microscope because a lot of this i'm telling everybody is like i don't have a picture to show anybody but like i could show you the super i'll show you a cold here what cold pure fresh press looks like under a microscope would look [ __ ] ridiculous yeah no you could see all those crevices i'm talking about so that would look like a cornbread on the inside not a cream as a as an example of these two are these the whipped and you're whipped and you're a fresh press are these the example of the fresh press held in its true fresh press position with that and then the whipping being the cold cured one yeah so you know what the next episode is reviewing the two of those yeah yeah one for the yeah exactly that's what exactly it is that's what it is it's my version i call whipped i tried to change the name while back um to um crushed cold cured or cold care crush or something nobody liked it and and nobody understood it i started explaining it to people over and over and then i could see like when i was explaining to them i was going right over their heads it was like too much information dude i'm gonna look into it because there's definitely some something in the food industry that is doing that to get the oxygen out of something like pressing it with it love though with not pressing it you know there's something i want to figure out this makes total sense yeah like he said fold it when you let's see instead there's a there's a technique when you when you've made um foam when if chefs made foam and when you introduce that to like a a pie or something you want to make or you want to make a meringue pie look at making meringue pies it's exactly that make the meringue the meringue is like really airy full with air that part of it you don't is not directly related because they have to introduce the air to make the meringue like that but once you've made the meringue you don't just you have to fold that in so gently to the rest of the ingredients to blend it in correctly it's very gentle and and but if you don't do it correctly you'll just have big ass pockets of foam and it won't be blended with the whole thing when you make a cake like a meringue i mean yeah i mean wow that's interesting and so it it's similar to that but like um i i think really breaks down to is just visually the ox the the cavities that have surface area available to the available surface area to be broken down is what we need to break down that's what we're trying to achieve is the only less surface area that's available for oxygen to break down the rosin just like why we why we don't want bubble hatching in a bubble hatch form too much surface area exposed to the trichome we want to crush it yes so that now the surface area is very minimalized like it's the same thing you know like you're still needing to do that once you've made the rosin so you think you have done it and you're done well you're not if there's a bunch of surface area that can be very interesting in there you need to still now further refine that down to be removing the oxygen in it that's why i call it crushing it because realistically that's kind of what you're doing is crushing it and i crushed it into the corner of the jar now we should talk to nicotia about it more at this class too because i heard him in his live video the other day explaining whipped then he explains it the same exact way it was really funny about how you crush it into the jar he said it's the same way as you explain it yeah yeah okay so that's crazy yeah and we don't really work together nothing you know what you mean yeah for sure yeah and it's like he totally explained it that way you're not whipping it he said you're actually crushing it down in the corner of the jar he said so it's definitely that's hilarious well recognized something we're figuring this out and he's a very smart guy he's probably figured out more on a technical level too what i'd like to hear what he has just well just like yourself i mean damn dude that was interesting as [ __ ] on the technical level just now so that's exactly how i like i'd like to hear what he is his take is on it too because it would be really weird like if he came up with the same hypotheses as me doing this in a totally different state far from each other not really using information from each other like in the case like if scientists were developing something in two different areas we we're not using each other's information to take our studies with his information you know making it to where mine's not you know so it is it is really crazy and weird to hear him say it like that right away too and so that's what i think is happening is it's just no one's realizing we need to further finish the process because you think you've made rosin you think you've done that and you have you have right then but if later on it it still cures up and it's dry looking then you've needed to do it again you need to remove that oxygen you know what i'm saying so would you recommend doing that once every some amount of time then i would recommend doing it one time right in the beginning letting it sit for maybe 12 hours or 24 hours and checking on it and if it starts to dry up then i would do it again if it doesn't you don't need to do it again that'd be possibly introducing oxygen into it that you didn't because you did it correctly and the process worked out with the way the terpenes are maybe like i talked about more viscosity the viscosity is a lower viscosity so it's like more more more of a thin so that it can crush down on itself easier already so like if if it's done you don't need to do it again it's done if it stays wet with that terp layer on top then you've achieved it it's not going to do that if there's surface area for those terpenes to go lay in like if there's cavities or crevices inside that rosin now if it has cured up more not necessarily dried but look dried out because the thc has bound with itself and then caused a little cavity inside there now once it bow itself because crystallize is kind of when it binds it's going to have little gravities cavities underneath it and then terpenes are going to go find it and lay in it and then you can't see them now they're inside the rosin in those little tiny holes they're puddles made all throughout under a microscopic level so you need to go back down in there and remove all those tunnels those holes all those things that were where the crystallized like because crystals aren't square or circle or anything nice so when they lay on each other there's gonna be spots all over the place where it can be a big hole wow i was just starting to get like really into figuring out about hash but i feel like it's on a more molecular level with rosin yeah that is crazy that's awesome this i think this is the story the science behind why everything is not shelf stable in this world why it's you know that's one of the freezer if you care about one of the things that you got me it got me into thinking about these different processes is trying to extend shelf life yeah boom exactly you open my mind to that whole aspect of it and why i think that you know things are the way that they are it adds so much price i feel like to them and all that stuff because it has to be in a cold truck the whole time and all this [ __ ] so and the end consumer it's like most people just they don't even know what's up not only has it been a cold truck it has to be a cold truck it has to be sent at just the right angle it can't be on its side or upside down so when it's like packaged it has to be packaged in the truck on a different level i keep i've done any weed or any other product that these guys have touched wow because they could just throw pounds of weed in their truck like these guys have to like put it in a box that's like strapped down or something or like secured correctly you know like in a bigger box that closes or something you can't just have them flying around in the back of your truck um totally it's like way more steps to this thing like you said of course the value's gonna go up yeah because there's so many more hands having to be involved and it takes a more intelligent person that's not just more intelligent a more educated on this aspect person to be able to yeah to be able to manage all the steps of it to get to the store so you have to have somebody that wants more money because he spent the time to to know how to talk to to to touch these things you know to to like to to to to take them from one star to the next like you said you have to have a refrigerated truck you have to have a [ __ ] you can't have them upside down you can't be [ __ ] you can't be crushing in the box that they're in or the you know i mean you can't be [ __ ] them up like there's a lot more to it you you can't you got to be more delicate and there's more steps to the process and since there's more steps to the process it always adds more money straight up just like when you make a tiffany bracelet it costs a lot more money and it's only a silver bracelet it's not even that much like i bought my wife a tiffany bracelet one time and it really opened my eyes though because you're like what the [ __ ] did they charge someone [ __ ] money for this thing for silver it's just silver solid silver but it's like 600 for a bracelet right just silver links you start looking at the links though and like touching them because you spent 600 on it so you're really going to [ __ ] look at it you're like what the [ __ ] wow sure does feel nice like you can't find a link like a cut into like oh like wow they put them all together now they're like perfect perfect like you can't find where it was split you can't find an imperfection in each link every [ __ ] one of them and they like is polished to perfection and it feels like different than you've ever felt and it's like okay i'm starting to see why this thing costs so much money now like wow someone spent a lot of time on this yeah someone went through a lot of trouble to make sure i couldn't see one line where it was split not one not even just a line you can't see where they grounded down and made it it's perfectly the same size all the way around somebody had to you know how hard that would be to do right that's why they have their name and that's what i appreciate you know it's like that's why you have to appreciate time and and someone's art that's when someone does that and they put their heart into something like that someone's but the machine made that thing perfect like that and they put their heart in that thing and then you go okay i want how much time did you [ __ ] spend on this john yeah we're charging 700 bucks for these and everybody's like sure i'll take one straight up not going to get anywhere else oh i just bought my wife a tiffany uh necklace for christmas that's what her present is she doesn't know but that's awesome it's pearls and silver and like nice dude you know when it comes from tiffany's i didn't even get to see it but like like we talked about i know the quality is gonna be on another level i can see in the pictures that it looks like it is but i know that's how it works when there's somebody like tiffany's and that's what i always try to strive to be is something like that where you just know it's going to be that quality you don't have to even you could see it but you don't have to you're not going to question it no without a doubt yeah you know it's going to come like oh okay i see why you charged me so much for that i just used them as an example the other day i feel like i just used tiffany's as an example yeah it is it's a good one i use it even like i take i took pictures of tiffany's in the box of tiffany's to my my designer i'm like dude check me look at this [ __ ] these [ __ ] get a lot of money for this box you know it's like special box right mm-hmm dude for real no it's because you're not a chick yeah so like for real i didn't either okay yeah so tiffany's box is special it's this special color that their boxes are it's like this bluish teal and it's a standard box that you would think of and it has a lid on it and then above it's like white and it it's like just their their their brand thing you know like tiffany's box let's pull it up he's pulling it up right now oh this is office yeah you gotta see it this is something i wanted i took it to them and i'm like dude we gotta copy this [ __ ] too they're on it they know what they're doing see it's like this special looking box like so if you see that box you don't even nee you just know you got a tiffany something from tiffany's the color and the the shape and the bow mm-hmm it's all this like like they have different sizes so they have something whatever it is it's all there yeah they have like they even have vases bosses and [ __ ] you know i mean like they have all sorts of [ __ ] yeah oh yeah there's all the information on it and stuff yes and then you like open it up there's another box inside of it there's like another one inside of it wow yeah see wow yeah so you you you go and you can tell though like when you get it like my wife draws the box in our safe yeah like that's that's that's where i started to steal my ideas from is what companies like that because that's how everybody works i mean come on and they all were all they spent a lot of money on that show no no joke 710 labs have the nicest [ __ ] boxes yeah they're the nice and they're the one and the other one of the boxes i always take to the to my designer too i'm like i want one like this magnus yeah totally i love that like i was that's one of the ones we're gonna do next is a a thicker cardboard box like theirs is where it's like and it's a clam shell like a wedding ring they magnetize it's very similar to theirs because they're not they know what the [ __ ] they're doing yeah no totally this is the center wood yeah i mean they did the research because i've done it too and i've looked and i couldn't find anything better still to this day if i put my logo on one of those boxes you know it would look like it would be [ __ ] good amazing yeah so i'm gonna do that for like some special special a box or something i'm thinking like you know like a limited edition temple yeah yeah cool probably like different one of them different strains mm-hmm 20 strains of stuff yeah no kidding yeah i got like kiwi oh you have old oh okay like the the flavors that otherwise would never be made into temple balls oh my god that's extremely exciting yeah like a whole bunch because like i've been getting more and and uh that guy that was here the other day um nick nicholas black yes okay yeah was uh he's like wanting some more loved it dude he loved it loved and he was like dude because he he needs medicine like real medicine like he'd been in bed body pain been bedridden for like a year and that's why he had to quit his job and [ __ ] like so he he was like blown away he's like dude this stuff's different he's like this is like [ __ ] medicine bro stretch what he said he's like i never i i did yard work all day it's like i'm about to do that in a long time he's like i put in eight hours and i'm like sore but like normal sore not like dead sore like he's like did i [ __ ] feel i can get my life back that's honestly amazing yeah it's [ __ ] amazing it's amazing to hear that so it's like and and like i was been thinking that i feel like uh there um i need to treat it more like a currency kind of like me putting gold in the safe because if i make a bunch of temple balls it's just money no straight up i mean and man those are that's the coolest expression the people that appreciate it yeah [ __ ] love it so that's awesome bro and you're starting to get more people that are actually appreciating it straight like i kind of went away from it and i have plenty for just me mm-hmm if i'm just smoking yet yeah yeah but if people are going to be appreciating them more like they are and i i do feel like i told you before i feel like temple balls are going to come back i think it's going to take i think it's this quality maybe maybe six years i feel like maybe less because i feel like the society progresses in a um what they think is cool totally you know totally good right totally so so um and so like then once they start doing that then they'll do research on it once they feel like it's cool because then they'll figure it out straight up but like like dog food like people fired out it figured out it's cool to feed your dog good dog food so they all started researching dog food and now nobody buys kibbles and bits for their dogs anymore dude no straight up when you said that to me it clicked and it made sense that like we are definitely fighting the same war because i had been saying this [ __ ] about food about just like literally go back to long island where i'm from i left there and you could not find any quality organic food as a food desert no local food nothing like that i go back there and there's like quite a good decent bit of health food stores and i'm like oh okay it's starting there even in a food desert you know where food is getting imported there yeah it is very coming here it's really it's actually coming quickly yeah i think like even in the last two years from when you would like have to go find somewhere to eat if you were a vegetarian you were harvard i'm having a hard time i am into exactly now you have a lot more options literally and like tenfold exactly and so i feel like that is is is the exact same way the weeds gonna trend is becoming cool now weeds becoming people are finding out it's medicine people are finding out okay then they're gonna go okay well we've been smoking bho yeah exactly they're gonna be like wait what all it's gonna take is once you start figuring out that you're shining arms you're not smoking you're not you you don't want to feed your dog kibbles and bits anymore the second you feed that found out you were feeding your dog your body kibbles and bits you're gonna go whoa see man would you like to collaborate with me on my book because for real i've been working on this project and i feel like you you have the same passion for it and you can help me to write it it is the cannabis conspiracy and that's why they've been oppressing it the whole time because once you [ __ ] really learn about cannabis and love it and see that the people that are growing it are [ __ ] working hard they're not lazy that is a [ __ ] mind control thing you know once you really get in comp into the lifestyle and stuff you realize that it you know i can grow this i grow my own food i'm gonna consume everything that i'm doing that and put it out into the world you know just the best that i possibly can i think that's the kind of what's going i think that's true i mean i think that everybody just does it what and then once you find out and you think it's cool then you do your research on it and you go oh [ __ ] it's not cool to feel my dog pills in bed which one is the cool one to feed my dog you know no seriously though especially with a dog is a good example because i always say about weed like um people young kids 20 year olds they're not they're not like yo vegetables i'm going to learn how to go grow vegetables but straight up with weed the 20 year old kids are excited about it the food that is the thing dog food is something that is going to get people to care about their health or that people think about more than they care about their own health because they want their animals for 40 years 10 years exactly exactly i'm willing i thought i was feeding my dog the best dog food because i was looking for like the best most expensive ones straight up and i thought that was the best one i didn't do my research i would look at the bags the bags would trick me it would like be cool like i would give a pro plan because they sold it the dog the vet my vet would tell me to sell it because they get money on a cut on all the bags of [ __ ] dog food i wasn't thinking about any of that i just thought i was dude go upstairs walk out of the room walk out of the [ __ ] room guy jesus christ i was just thinking that it's the you know what i mean is it's just definitely was the best that i was supposed to do that was telling me to feed my dog this food and straight up any research on it and then my wife was the one that told me to get it and then once you do was you like oh [ __ ] i thought i was feeding my dog the best literally shay has the exact same story yeah i had no idea i was [ __ ] killing my dog and then i was lining your pockets just right in the world it's like bho is similar to that in the cannabis ministry you go to these places and they're pushing it because they're making the most money on it at this different tree they're making the most money on the bho product so that's what they're pushing and then the people that are coming in that are uneducated or just buying what they think is the best [ __ ] and some of these companies are putting good bows and ribbons on it and then making it look really cool and really cool names of different things to trick you they're stealing the same names too live resin and then they're they're now doing like they'll put like numbers on there to trick you like you know how you'll see 70 to 120 and uh for like a u for like rosin yes yeah yeah no bho will actually put things like 70 to 120 and if you look really close it'll say hours in an oven back up no dude oh my god that is nuts just 120 they'll say 120. and you're like oh look it's 120 of you that says 128 hours in an at a vac oven dude that is [ __ ] cool so they're not just playing gimmicks with people that don't know what they're doing so it's not i don't think it's going to take six years it's what started me on this you know i don't think it's gonna take very long at all because people are picking up on it trending it's very trendy and once people picking up on a trend they're gonna just google it mass consciousness it doesn't take very hard for you to figure this out so fast nowadays [ __ ] google cannabis and google what your box that you're smoking just start googling that [ __ ] the bh what is it made of let me google that that's it you'd be done just like we did with dog food what is on the dog foods bag we start reading it and going son of a [ __ ] look what's on the ingredients list for our dogs food look at your [ __ ] hash box that would be the same thing blow your [ __ ] mind on the bho [ __ ] that's on there and that's not even all the [ __ ] that they're telling you that they're dealing with just like just dog food [ __ ] so like of course if you could break it down to like they did with dog food they took all the ingredients out that are fun just limited the ingredients down to barely anything just like making hash you make it from the barely any ingredients ice water heat pressure that's like all that's involved so of course when you make it out of the most basic things you know it's going to be better that's how everybody's finding out too i lasted the test of time thousands of years making instead of [ __ ] you know that's why it won't be very long people finding out no i know people still to this day that i'll be like um you know what bh people don't know what bho is they don't even know that bho is made with butane my father didn't know this not very long ago that he had no idea that to make stuff that he would smoke live resin that it was made with one of the [ __ ] these yeah exactly he had no idea it was literally not even figuratively like literally with this tip they put it over a tube that they blast this over the cannabis and then once it rinses over all of it it just drips out the bottom this liquid drips right right right that is what then they try to get this liquid out of it and then you smoke it yeah no totally it's the most no clue the most insane concept that is really how he was smoking because he didn't know he had no idea he'd seen it and it looked cool like diamond shapes and it's kind of translucent color it's pretty bho looks pretty for the most part yeah i mean until the raw you become educated but when you first see it and you see it and you think of concentrate you're like oh cool stoked on the gimmick of getting concentrated cannabis you know exactly and you see it you think it's an amazing idea and then you start smoking it and it looks like cigarettes too you smoke bho you don't realize it's [ __ ] you up like when you smoke cigarettes you could smoke packed cigarettes all day long if you smoke cigarettes you're fine with that right if i smoked a cigarette i would die yeah it would just ruin my throat totally but if somebody smoked cigarettes they could smoke a whole pack a day it doesn't [ __ ] their throat up doesn't mean it's not [ __ ] your throat up yeah exactly [Laughter] [Applause] that's not what's happening it's not that you're getting hurt more than me i mean i'm going to hurt more than you because i'm physically showing signs of it it's you have done now tainted your palate so much that you don't even know the bho is [ __ ] you up and the reason it [ __ ] me up is because i haven't smoked bho and if i do smoke a tiny bit of it i will pick up that and it'll actually [ __ ] me up like if i smoked a tiny bit of tobacco it would [ __ ] me up if there was a tiny bit of tobacco on my bong rip it would [ __ ] me up but i could smoke bomb roots all day long because i've used it like what's the opposite it works the same way too if a guy just smoked tobacco all day he tried to do a bomber he's done you you bet you you have to be used to it and if you're not he's gonna [ __ ] you up and that's what's deceiving too because people are like vho doesn't [ __ ] me up well it doesn't because you smoke it all day because you're used to it just like cigarettes don't [ __ ] people up that smoke cigarettes all day long yeah your throat doesn't hurt when you smoke vho all day long you're [ __ ] yourself up you just don't realize it because you like [ __ ] that thing up like telling you yeah that's what i was trying to say exactly um what's called the bio um [ __ ] but yeah you know your body telling you something yeah it's like you [ __ ] that up you don't even got that one to tell you it's like you [ __ ] that thing up the good [ __ ] angel has left you're dealing with the devil now that's it so it's like what it is it seems like two so you yeah you just have to be educated on it and then exactly bottom line yeah it is it's the bottom line because like i say also about food i still eat taco bell i still eat jack-in-the-box i'm not as good as you but i don't do it every day well that's the bottom line too exactly i've always said that one of the reasons i'm so hard on my diet is so that i don't i can if i have to eat whatever the [ __ ] i you know right in the apocalypse i'm gonna eat whatever the [ __ ] and my body's ready for it yeah that too that is part of the thing too i feel like as long as you eat it once in a while that's all yeah you just can't you just can't eat it every day exactly you just can't eat mcdonald's like you saw that movie right or that yeah yeah super size me yeah so exactly you can't do that you can't that's why i tell people about bho you can't super solve it with me you can't do that right make a documentary too now make make somebody just smoke solvent all week no dude that would be so they're a look they're like a full look one of the kids that that'll fight for it to the death though i'll just be like okay cool cool man you're going hard on the bhs we'll make your diet happen this week but we're gonna we're gonna switch over next month it's a 60-day film instead of the third year by the end he's like a fully educated like a lawyer [Music] yeah that [ __ ] it's just like it's just knowledgeable just like damn food just like we did with our organic food a guy we talked to you about millions of times you when you went to the grocery store ten years ago how big was the organic food section it was [ __ ] non-existent it was just a section like you said yeah non-existent in some stores even like in the in the poor areas where i'm from in san diego totally didn't even exist because you weren't going to afford it it was a waste of a space in my store totally like no one had that so it was like stupid we couldn't even witness we were lucky to get a [ __ ] apple you weren't going to be buying those expensive apples right yeah i didn't even know [ __ ] roma tomatoes existed like i was like oh my god there's different totally different heirloom tomatoes and [ __ ] i'm like oh my god what the [ __ ] is this but yeah nowadays just they're [ __ ] not even just a section it's like just mingled throughout the whole store now at this point the organic food has gotten so big they don't even have an organic food section number one straight up no i agree with you it's like just mingled in with everything now straight up it's like you got your organic [ __ ] sour cream next to your sour cream now yeah yeah and it's like that's just how you do it now two shoppers it's not gonna be no no like tiny little section like when we're kids it didn't even [ __ ] exist some of it is just marketing and branding too though because some of this [ __ ] was already organic like some of these places were doing this [ __ ] and i didn't even like market it organic they're like we should promote that we do all organic [ __ ] here no that's hilarious straight up exactly that's the whole point it became you know literally it's it's something that um as i've said about solventlessness and hash in general it's like it's bigger than the people doing it it's a big big thing that's a wave we can't stop it no one can [ __ ] stop it get the [ __ ] behind it or be in the [ __ ] motion that it is on and be part of your [ __ ] move you know i've seen it once once i started having people's moms mom their grandmothers wanting to smoke that's when i started seeing this [ __ ] change though because that's when you're like whoa [ __ ] like grandma is intrigued on this [ __ ] now for her [ __ ] glaucoma right for real and then like finding out like [ __ ] i'm willing because grandma's willing to do whatever at this point because she's trying [ __ ] hydro hydro hydrocut whatever the [ __ ] some crazy pill you know what i mean they put her on i'm sure you know that she gave her crazy side effects at this point she's like what do you mean some some weed that sounds sounds about like the best idea i've heard yet you know what i'm getting straight up straight up let's read what the doctors are giving you in the hospital yeah no not good for real you don't want to know how any of that shit's made that shit's horrible for you and that's like your only option or some pain medicine that's like horrible for you yeah no for real so so right like you said it's a wave is way bigger than all of us and it's coming just because it is many ways hips [ __ ] good for [ __ ] everything and and cannabis is good for everything and it brings people to something that takes like passion and love to two that brings out things and i think everybody too is something like to make the best cannabis it takes someone with passion and love not just some joe show mo [ __ ] [ __ ] that wants a bunch of money that's true though he won't that's friends it doesn't matter yeah chad brad do you see that what she did oh my god she went off bro oh [ __ ] oh my god i was blown away damn i wish i watched that one yeah she's on her page oh today okay it was on she said that all the chads and brads and she went all through because it's like yeah i don't matter how much money you have you'll find out real quickly you still need that guy that takes or a girl that takes pride and passion to grow that plan period bottom line it won't won't happen joe [ __ ] [ __ ] with all the money in the [ __ ] world will find out really [ __ ] quick [ __ ] like they just even did in working with some of them they [ __ ] went big with that and some of them fell on their [ __ ] face because that [ __ ] wasn't as easy as they thought um it's all molded well they started fine some of it they start finding out if they brought it on the stock that it brings up the cbd and drops the thc so you can guarantee a temp wow i remember frenchie saying if you do that never i would never work with you yeah that thing we were at yeah like if you write your plans on the stock people do that a lot like that was a big thing going on in oregon this year in washington where they rotted it on the stock because it brought up the cbd levels and dropped the thc levels so some people were actually doing strains they were ta they were actually cannabis strains because they had too much thc and they were good yielders and they produced really well and they had a good cbd in them and they knew they were just going to rob it so they can get rid of the cbd or the thc in it they did it all intentionally some of them from the beginning right like they started a straight they knew they were going to how are they going to make use of rot just extracts no no um cbd yeah what are you gonna do with that though yeah you totally just turn blast it yeah just like to blast it i guess to make tinctures and [ __ ] yeah yes you just blast into whatever you want not just teachers you can make anything you want yeah whatever you're making whatever you want you just go right to extract if it's just whatever you want food anything you want yeah yeah i'm saying because some actually some were actually selling um him but there was some guys that were trying to really sell like nugs of him i saw when i went to oregon too and there was like it was like high quality hemp like it wasn't bud rot though no no but this guy had small small amounts these guys were rotting it were like that's hundred thousand acres yeah right to extract people grow that for direct extract and they would just provide a few members and then they just grind it up into just a few they grind it up into biomass yeah exactly whole plant fresh piles fresh biomass yeah exactly yeah so yeah it definitely is what it is that's why he takes takes a little bit of um just education because all these companies are just gonna bring in somebody they're just gonna bring in somebody that smarter than me on all this [ __ ] and then just pay them to figure it out because that's the only way you can do it they have to do it you have to bring in somebody that knows what the [ __ ] he's doing and then you can still are going to need a whole team of people that are going to have love and passion for this planner else you're going to produce garbage and that's what that's the separation i think similar to budweiser you're always gonna have a bow wiser you're always gonna have somebody that walks past all the really good beers and decides no i don't want any of those really good [Laughter] at each beers four hours driving up to humboldt me and him screaming each other because he's like people still buy mcdonald's yeah he's like you know why made a very good point we're gonna make mcdonald's because they still buy it and their money is still good he made a very good point they're not really trying to stop us from what we're doing but we are trying to stop them from what they're what they're [ __ ] doing so it does make it a little bit of an uphill battlefield for us like you know the mcdonald's people first yeah you know but it's like you know it's a battle that the consumer in the end it's in the hands and the eyes yeah you're you're never going to stop that guy that goes so past all the good beer [ __ ] bubble eyes you're never going to stop him and to to think you are is crazy you're never going to stop somebody from feeding their dog kibbles and bits yeah exactly yeah we're gonna stop that's a sad battle and you're never gonna stop somebody there's gonna be somebody that's gonna still do that even though you tell them all the education on it even though you show them the proper one and and they find out they get it for really close to the same price or or even the same price just not even going to be the deterrent they're going to be like but my dog likes the red and the green ones totally boom yeah i mean 100 and then how are you going to argue with that yeah and then that's that you're like damn it it's like i had to argue the other day with a guy for like hours she's on on messages uh and he was like telling telling me that he knew how to make a better uh fire rosin than my hash awesome and he said this is the troll right dude no you're dead serious and he's like the reason that i don't think that flower ross is as good as hash rosette is because i don't know how to fresh flowers i'm good like he does he's saying that about that what about your opinion or show you i didn't have nothing to do with that because i saw the means that i wanted to talk to the guy and i wanted to tell him like hey from a decent perspective like i know these guys are clowning you because you're a [ __ ] idiot pretty much but i didn't want to go on your page i told him i dm'd him and said hey i didn't want to go on your comments and [ __ ] be a dick i wanted to to give you a chance to explain yourself before i took that comic wrong because what he said was his flower rosin is the same as ash rosin yeah and then it was like okay dude so like everybody starts ruining him yeah like bashing him so bad dude like he was like even complaining to me saying that his followers don't want to follow him anymore because they were all bashing him so much and it was all over the instagram thing that sucks jesus your instagram notoriety your book is [Music] like you wouldn't believe this [ __ ] he was like crying to me about it too and then but he's still telling me this stupid-ass [ __ ] like that i'm like dude okay he's like telling me well how come my rosin comes out perfectly clear there's no fats there's no plants there's no plant matter in it nothing it's just the same when you tell me under a botany's perspective of what's the difference in this i we both liquefy trichomes there's no different honestly my response would be like dude you would literally you would need to grow a flower that was 99 i tried hey i tried telling you i said why so much lower in thc yeah how come that you tell me that that's what science though that's what i said i think of science first of all i said first of all i'm not a botanist nor do i think you are right so explaining botany terms to someone that's not a botanist is ridiculous right yeah so let's let's not go there i said that's why i was like just tell me what tell me about it like what's going on can you grow 99 percent trichos dude you should just be like all hash on a planet he went dude he went on and told me like that's a really good definition i was like dude i'm not trying to be a dick this is this is the comments that i had in him oh yeah long conversation that's exciting so finally i ended up telling him look because i said look he's like my rosin just looks just the same as hash rather than i said a picture i said i don't think your rosin looks like that yeah dude i said so obviously something's in your rosin cause he's here's his oh i mean honestly it looks like a really nice flower rossignol oh that's what i told him the very first thing i said was curious nice flower russian yeah like the insane oh yeah that's actually beautiful yeah that's why he said there's there he was like going off about how i wonder if he even still has it up yeah but i bet the fresh press doesn't look as clear as that fresh press that's all i can say yeah but it is beautiful though no he has gorgeous work yeah for sure when they say flowers and hashtags on a different do you know what you're talking about or yeah he's just being a dick about it because he's like butthurt because right because he got bashed on he doesn't want to do the hashmaking process that's why right so i'll hit him up for an interview i'm gonna be like bro please i'll pay you for an interview not only that he would do one probably last week because he was like really dude like we talked for a long time you want to see if he'll come on right now while you're here while you're here because we're going to talk about you trying to tell me nobody nobody makes flowers and it's any good that's on the market yes yes i know that might be valid too have you heard of honeybiter i said oh true very true but honestly though nobody makes draws and like you like that [ __ ] like you're willing to do and stuff like that nobody makes it on the market either so i'm just trying to be devil's advocate but but his is beautiful yeah he's like yeah yeah this problem is great news he said no you're right though honey butter too yeah but the problem was like i told him you just can't you can't compare the two because they're not in the same category i said first of all you need to go do your own experiments do your own side-by-sides that's what i told him do a side-by-side experiment yourself and and do flower raws and pressing and that same stuff makes some hash out of it rosin and then smoke them next to each other let's see and you tell me because i ended up just telling him after he told me that i don't make as good of ha flower rosin as him is why i don't think flower rosin as good as hot rosin and i said you don't know how to make hash rosin is why you think flower ross isn't as good as half possible yeah that's the thing because if you knew how to make good ash browsing it would be a joke when you put it next to good flower awesome straight up and like if you can make that out of flower rosin just imagine sir you could probably make fire and then he tried to tell me it cost too much money to utilize the equipment to make hashtags and i said you're they're completely wrong and 100 machine you can do it with just water or you can do it with a [ __ ] paddle yeah no that's right exactly you don't even need anything but instead of that straight up we'll get a set of bags that are like 60 dollars with the wood you can cut the wood that's like 60 dollars for bags you can get all the bags boom yes cheap ones and they work great you don't make good stuff 100 they're i'm not going to say to put the best material in them but they're the best [ __ ] if you ain't got nothing to use and you're trying to tell me it's too much money that 60 dollars cost too much money that's it because that's what it would cost you for real and you can make ice in your house and honestly it would increase that [ __ ] to where it's like that coloration is what people [ __ ] on full spec for is having that yellow yellowish tint but honestly like that that flower rosin could be [ __ ] fire hash rosin definitely if you can make that out of fat i've never seen flower awesome look like that no i've never seen flowers that's why i'm very surprised i thought he was impressed yeah oh no dude i was gonna be dude the very first thing i said to the guy being nice is i said yo my name is brett bird i didn't want to post on your page and cause conflict i wanted to ask you what you meant when you said flower rosin and hash rosin are different do you even know what you're talking about i pressed lots of flower rosin in my day but i know the difference between hash rosin i wanted to give you the chance to explain yourself explain yourself before i took it the wrong way and where was i said i thought that i said that right away i said you're flowers and cause i told him at one point i said your fire rosin looks fire that's it yeah there's nothing i just don't think you know how to make hash rawson because then you would know i said i remember the first time that i had made good hash austin and it blew my [ __ ] mind so like that's the difference is when you actually make some good ass ash housing straight up i imagine yeah i imagine because i never made flower rosin but also i've experienced it a bunch of times and it was it seemed to be just like with hash from cure or rosin from cured material it's a lot more likely you're going to get browner darker material and from what i know about flower rosin it's very sappy so it doesn't last as long because it all will uh oxidize yeah he tried to tell me he tried tommy and we are alive and we are recording that live yeah it um he he he um tried to say his doesn't deteriorate breakdown in arizona he does it yeah it's like yeah he just explodes i'll narrate if you want to read them he said when you take it from a botany point of view it's resin compared to store-bought material all the time i don't know what what yeah what he's trying to tell me that he's flowers he's compared to hash rosin in arizona no difference he said there's no difference is what he said and that's what got everybody going well honestly there's obviously a terpene profile difference if you can get just the flower to go get this i would love to taste that like i would actually like i would literally hit him up when going to the gym show in arizona next year or whatever [ __ ] i'm gonna hit him up and be like bro i'll buy like any small amount just to try it because i i really like i'm very curious if there is some type of like you know flavor either but you should you see that flower rosin that we pressed here didn't you yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah totally no i was buyer too but yeah totally and i've seen one time very fire flower rather than get pressed but i just i wonder how it would be aged and just because this guy has a claim to fame for it so you know it's like awesome yeah he is very good though david goliath you know oh he has a bird video on there no this is yours i had some i was trying to find some flowers and then i'd get back in the day nerd for real i'll [ __ ] if he responds he went off and talked to me like nope he seemed like a fairly decent guy tell you the truth no and that's it that's really more so this is the battle of a lifetime oh wow yeah no that's fired auto buttered half of it autobuttered see i'm just curious because it's like that auto butter part would have maybe been the trichomes that popped and squeezed out and you know i mean it's like so it's like that's the fire and if if you watch the hash obviously that's what you would have gotten or something you know or something like yeah you would have got like the whole thing to be like that tiny little piece right there but not contaminated [Laughter] he's like trying to tell me like it doesn't fill your [ __ ] thing full of [ __ ] i'm like come on dude if i don't even use a bag when i smash my flower i'm like oh my god so you're like just picking all the particles out of it like what a [ __ ] layman wow that is some [ __ ] that is some [ __ ] yeah i'm sure he'll he'll talk to you though because he he he talked my ear off cool no that sounds like a great conversation he was the one that and he was all crying because nobody wanted to go to his page and none of his friends that's what he was saying as i was gonna tell you none of his friends wanted they were all mad because he's like i forgot he said how he said it everybody was [ __ ] all over his page is that him i hope oh no i wish yeah i hope that i wish and keep thinking about it is it easy that's all that means i was like oh no what did this guy do but that's still all right i mean i'm still impressed by his flower rosin regardless of his statement hash trolls just took that statement and ran with it and blew it in out of proportion when they yeah it's a bunch of hands is it one word oh okay it's two words well either way i'm gonna hit him up be like bro we are the hash trolls thank you so much took that statement and blew it out of proportion when they could have cleared it up with the conversation and spread that [ __ ] about me on ig like a 19 year old now i have all my followers dming me for the help because they don't want to be harassed in the area that they want to hang out and learn it no way oh my god the people are just around they're losing their ability to share and learn from each other as well as me learning from them in a public discussion and it's all hidden in the private comments what is happening because everybody just went off on him they all probably all deleted their own comments and privatized their comments or something like that or like or remove themselves from being his follower so it like [ __ ] up the whole threads that they were all reading that is really [ __ ] up if it was like a hash thread i'd be like dude but it's like there's literally a whole thing dude you don't you don't get it it's a whole [ __ ] thing everybody hates on flower rosin man everybody [ __ ] hates on it there's like a science why people do it the other way man you know it's like primitive technology that's all it's and it's laziness he even said dude the real truth that he held back was that he doesn't want to pay the money and spend the 60 dollars and [ __ ] do the effort he held it back and then he was like and that's it there's no like you know pencil drops everyone in the room is like wait what dude that's exact that's the whole point is doing a little bit extra work that's all i responded back yeah yeah oh my gosh that's just crazy because that probably the material he's watching would probably or he is not watching we probably watch amazing so great material he isn't watching a great job he's i'm sure it's beautiful the whole the listen so washing you know you're washing it you're cleaning it up you're washing it that's what you need to do to your material friend i tried to tell them that's what i said i said you'll someday you'll wash some hash and then your mind will be blown and then you'll know that's what you should have been doing straight up straight holy [ __ ] straight up it's hilarious he will life changing that's a holy [ __ ] type of thing it's just it's flower rosin is flower rosin i mean it's it's it's got its place that's why i try to tell them i was like dude i teach it at my class straight up i was like i was not trying to be a dick if i was trying to be a dick i would have just laughed at you like everyone else that's hilarious no and that's the whole thing is a teacher cannot even teach when a mind is not open no exactly but you're taught me a lot of stuff you're just trying to tell me just closed-mindedly that oh just tell me on a botany level and then i try to ask a question like well tell me the why the percentage of the thc is considerably lower on flower rosin and hash rosin would you not explain that to me then obviously there's there's your number like that should be your math right it should tell you percentage of thc is how much percentage of thc and then he didn't respond to that but then he's telling me how clear his rosin is when i sent a picture of my rosin and said well i don't think your roses is clear so there's something in it because it should be probably translucent like your [ __ ] is nice looking but it's not white and it's not clear so it's not those two right and then he said it's not all about color i see literally bro you just brought up and said it was yours is clear and then there and how is there any different because we're not people who care about color out of all no of all the raw this guy is not going to be somebody that's going to push [ __ ] you know but he knows enough about it to be able to tell you and make you think about your [ __ ] a little bit that's what's right and i don't think you knew what i was at all that i like try to promote it that i was like trying to teach people that is the funniest part too is that you actually promote using power off yeah more than anyone you know exactly and that's why i don't it she kind of made me feel like obviously you didn't take any time to figure out who i was or what i've been doing because i've been promoting that for a long time and i tell everybody all the time that you know you need to learn how to press fire rosin and then step up to pressing hash browse in and because he's like trying to tell me too well you know everybody can can make hash rosten and i'm like that's fine i understand that and it's a good way to start to get yourself to making hashtags it's not i've made plenty of fire offs i mean someone that say and not everybody can make hash dank duchess insisted to me no mila is a grandmother you know and she makes ash and then also it's like anybody can you know do a very small batch maybe not everybody can do a [ __ ] big ass badge right well you know it's like for real everybody can do a five gallon bucket you know everybody could turn a five gallon wash machine on and buy a [ __ ] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah there you go straight up you know more than anything beyond anything else you can use a machine a small machine you know but for real very simply use a little bag a little wash machine you get for sixty dollars on ebay you don't need to retrofit it like we all do all this cool different things you have to have always clean your tube really well make sure you don't leave anything behind and wash it with hot water and some rubbing alcohol out afterwards you know and you can even save that ribbon out over use it over and over for that same process and and if you ain't got no money or no ability to like modify the machine if that's too much for your to buying one that's already modified because they sell them now bolt bag sells one like mine wow i'll modify with a valve on it and everything in the front bigger hose so it's not the crinkle hose oh it's like you go by it's like 300 bucks so i think okay it's like i think it's seven gallons or something i've seen a few sets a little bigger is upgraded yeah yeah it's like fully retrofitted like like weed like frenchy digs and so yeah you could buy all that [ __ ] it's like 300 dollars too that's not much it's your come on yes really it's all excuses like that's what i tell everybody too that's some [ __ ] because you'll see that person right there has a ps5 or something you know what i mean like it's all [ __ ] oh i got no money i can't afford that but i drive a sick ass car that i do a ton of modifications to wait wait a minute oh [ __ ] you can afford whatever the [ __ ] you want you need priority for like what i said about the frenchie class i had no money to get to the frenchie class i couldn't stay the night in the hotel down there i drove for seven hours that day or eight hours to go to his class and come back and spent all day learning of class i was stoked that i could spend my food money to be able to pay for his ticket for his class you pay for what you want you make what you want exactly that's it dude that [ __ ] dude cedric took a bus down to l.a to get seeds that okay yeah yeah you think about it oh okay that [ __ ] took a bus to l.a you ain't got time ability to figure it out you don't want it no bam wow that's that's intense he took the track of the lights on yeah wow he took a [ __ ] bus to l.a yeah long hours oh actually yeah two days right or like a day and a half yeah if you just if he if you took the bus train bus train thing yeah could get down at like 12 hours like 12 hours one way wow one wow plane is an hour and a half so i will tell him that next time but march pits if he probably got a bus train bus straight 25 dollars yeah [Laughter] he probably got that exactly because if you want it it's [ __ ] happened no you're right holy bird that's you're the [ __ ] man of that you make me believe in inspiring a good question for you for why homie also would be really inclined to besides the work and extra effort that's involved when you were saying last time you were saying how much practice you get out of pressing material yeah which means you also i'm imagining get a little bit more material just to then disperse somebody did tell me you got a good yield on fire yeah like uh 20 percent that's what i would imagine yeah but that's not very much i mean because you're not i mean you're getting like 90 percent off hash oh [Laughter] right because you've already gotten the [ __ ] yield off of turning it into bubble hash yeah yeah so like that that's where it becomes where i but the problem would be more profitable for him so i think that definitely is what it's about though is just like we were saying it's all education and it's straight up it's not wrong present flower but it's just hilarious that i i did i did want to kind of break it down for him but i started feeling like it was a waste of my time to even break it down yeah because it was like he was making like you said actually i didn't think about it that way you can't teach someone that's not wanting to learn so that's what it felt like it'd be wasting my time because he wouldn't absorb any of the information i would be giving him you know a light that he could use it later ever because he would always be negatively thinking about everything i'm saying to to just argue with me or second guess me exactly bias yeah because he's already doing he's got like all his flowers he's got to stand by exactly exactly somebody's gonna grab him and make him watch hash you know his best friend will do that for him you know somebody needs to you know well that's all i mean like so you're you know who else would grab you and shake you in you know i mean like he said i said i understand you know you might not have access to material and stuff like that and that's a big difference but there's a lot of different aspects of it too you know like having access somebody that has access to a lot of material is gonna have more material in the long run if they freeze it all because you could have more stuff to learn from if you learn out throughout the whole year but like if i turn all that and dried it i'm going to have very limited time to be able to press that into flower rose a very small window of time that i can press good flower oz and it looked like what he just did a very small window and so um it's fine for him because he's only producing such a small amount and he's only got flour but if he had like if he had like a real farm to deal with that would be like a joke it's just kind of funny because he has no idea and i was trying to explain that to him a little bit like if a real farm was like here you could have this and for you to turn that into flower rosin it wouldn't be realistic because you're not gonna have the room to dry all that material and you're also not gonna have the ability to get it all dried at the right time and put into a bag and then press into rosin before it dries out and goes back so like the only way to do a whole farm would be you have to deal with it on a different scale like and you dry it and then you can turn it into hash rosin because you could dry it and stick the weed into a freezer then you can deal with that throughout the year because you can pull the flour out and wash hash rosin that would be a viable way to do it but just making flower rods it's not really going to be a viable way you if you had a farm that said you could take this whole farm and turn it in whatever you wanted fire rising would not be a valuable option for that at all because this is not realistic like to dry all that and to turn it into rosin in a realistic time sense it wouldn't happen it would be garbage some of it would be good and some wouldn't and and so but you could turn it into hash rosin or live rosin the whole farm i'd have a consistently quality product and you wouldn't be able to with flowers just literally wouldn't be able to because there's such a small window of time that can be pressed into a product would have to be like a week you could so if you had like a whole farm like my family's farm you physically couldn't sit there with and press flowers and fast enough before it went back amazing so that's very intense cost and space and like where would you put it all no for frozen doesn't take up as much space as you think you could take a whole farm because you process it down off the stem and off the big leaves so you actually take a whole farm and you can put it down into turkey bags and freeze those turkey bags and turn a good farm into chest freezers and you can't really do that same scale and drying it to to dry what i've put in my freezers you would need a [ __ ] massive dry room massive to be able to dry the amount you can put into a freezer to get air flow yeah you know what i mean like if you're really just trying to like you hang dry weed in a room and they would you would just be really just really huge amount of scale and you're going to be very limited like the day that you can start pressing fire rosin you're going to have like two days or three days or a week and then it's going to be garbage so if you have little [ __ ] rooms full of this [ __ ] and you're going to press it and then after you press it it's not gonna be as good because it's full of [ __ ] other material because it's got a lower thc percentage straight up there's a lot of problems there's a lot it's one of the reasons why this is not a viable source to take all that material and turn it into a concentrate which is like why tim was kind of being a dick when he was talking to me but was right and that's why he was being a dick about it was you're wasting your time pressing foul rolling he was just a dick about how he said it to me he could have been a lot nicer and more considerate on like yeah you're really learning your craft that's awesome good job you're doing a good job like i was trying to do to that guy kind of that's what i was just thinking literally i was going to say that before is that you tried to give this guy the nice yeah what the [ __ ] exactly is [Laughter] [Music] oh i didn't put you on blast like everybody else wasn't my war i couldn't i could have been a dick to him so it's so funny and i didn't when you so you'd go right from a turkey bag do you tie them up and then throw them in the free in the chest and just let it be full as you can [ __ ] stuff it full doesn't really matter too much all right and that and that's how it basically dries or is that waiting until it's frozen in state it's exactly just like you cut it off the plant and then when you go to work with it again well freeze not right no no such thing no freeze drying later after you're removing i imagine that that freeze drying occurs like same way frostbite and like the condensation occurs if it falls out it's moist and wet so i accidentally let some thought out right when i was loading so that's not really the problem you're occurring here because what's happening is it's freezing the trichome so like it probably frost bites the flour but you're not extracting the flour right you're getting the trichome off of it it's just freezing so so you're freezing the whole material wow but the the the material might be frostbitten like if you were gonna eat the the flour like you were gonna eat a steak you know what i mean in a sense you freeze the steak and get frostbitten because i thought about this too but the trichomes not getting receiving frostbite because it's not water right and it's not it's not water soluble like that well no you don't have it in water either right well i'm saying the water being the ice water that's not in it oh it's next to it yeah it's not like in liquid water exactly it's just next to the frozen state of material because it's not you're and you're just removing the trichome yeah so like you probably do create some frostbite to the flower if it sits in there long enough but from my experience i'll wash it that's a year and a half two years old and it doesn't seem any different when you're washing it because what's happening is the trichome has been just frozen in its own separate state as a flower and you've just removed them and then you discard the flour they've just probably been frostbitten now and it could have excess moisture and everything else obviously froze inside yeah so but the trichome didn't matter because it was a different liquid that was frozen on its own and it doesn't have water in it or oxygen in it for it to have a frostbite actually uh effectively any agent or damage at all yeah it's in its frozen state yeah and it's not connected to anything else so it's just waiting for you to come and knock it off later that's awesome i was wondering how long it lasted the other thing that i was thinking is like you said um one large chest can hold probably like a green house yeah i mean like if you've got a 20 foot chest you could probably fit a [ __ ] huge green a big big-ass greenhouse in there if you wanted you know and if you really have to do what you do is like you can if you you can kind of like grab the turkey bag and squeeze it just a tiny bit to remove some of the excess air that's in that turkey bag and that when you when you twist it and just put like a twist tie thing on the top the turkey bags come with and then put it in the freezer that'll actually give you a lot more space in your freezer without really damaging any of the product at all because you're just kind of barely squeezing the air out you're not like and you don't put in the bag and like squish the [ __ ] out of it valuable information for next season straight up yeah for real seriously yeah you should be delicate don't cut anything with scissors don't expose that leaf surface to leach water out in to the chlorophyll into the water so you don't want to use scissors on the leaves at all when you process down so that would be but you wouldn't buck it with the scissors no you could do that that's not not with a scissor though i wouldn't do the scissors that that but you're not i wouldn't do a scissor because i'd be more worried about other things happening and there's going to be less control with the pair of scissors because you won't have any of the feel that you'll have with your hand there's a technique that you get when you do it with your hand that you can actually feel it achieving what you're trying to by popping all the buds off and not grabbing one or grabbing the next as you grab them and like [ __ ] them up at all and without the the feel of your fingers you won't really have that and you you could possibly grab some leaves while you're doing this in the process that are just in there and then cut the leaves with the scissors and if you're doing this with your hand you're not going to actually cut any of the leaves that you do grab in the same fashion i really would tell everybody just just leave the scissors alone don't even don't have your scissors like touching any of that horribly so because if you do you could like buck him down the scissors to like put it into a bin and then have somebody just sitting there bucking it into a bucket well part of it is is i guess everybody's used to or where i'm coming from with the bucking ideology is from dry product and so bucking a dry product you can feel that pop with the scissor and it goes and also if you did it by hand you would just dust all your [ __ ] nugs in this sense you can't because it's a full [ __ ] plant it's not just going to pop off easy yeah it's different snip if you were gonna snip them yeah it's different when you push and crush like that [ __ ] what would normally dust the whole nug is actually just gonna pull it off because it's a [ __ ] live plant yeah and string it and stuff like that so it's just different yeah you wanna you want to just ideally you'd want to just pop each nug off no and put it in the bag [ __ ] yeah man um so here i'm gonna i'm gonna end this and yeah we'll figure that stuff all out here", "mLdir-jTbm4": "mm-hmm all right guys I'm letting the press preheat and preheating the wax as well the puck of rosin of um hash this is bubble hash five grams and I'm just a slight pressure on there very little whatever is leaking out now it's just just pre oil from if I press it too fast it'll blow the bag out and it'll contaminate the rest of all of the rosin with the hash so I'm trying to just squeeze it slow and low like I said the temps I have was a little bit high usually I do about 180 175 I might drop this back down to 175 just because I don't want to put too much heat to the rosin I'm not trying to decarboxylate it I'm just trying to press it out of the out of the 25 micron bag that I'm using as a filter you can see it's already starting to pour out pretty decent like I said I haven't put any pressure on this yet but as soon as I do it's all gonna come out gushing like I said low and slow that's the way to do it to get the best quality rosin and this was hashed I've actually had sitting around for about a month it's just been sitting around just I haven't really been needed to use it till now so I'm gonna make me some rosin to smoke on not that I don't have any rosin but did for something different different profile different THC content everything is different every time unless you're running the same exact strings on all times me I'm always constantly running different strains and we're hitting 170 and 175 on the top and bottom plate so I can pretty much put all the pressure I need on it now and it should all start I mean out and as you can see it's pretty decent it's a little darker because like I said I've had this hatch sitting around for quite a while I didn't put it in the fridge or anything I just let it laying around so it's completely ready to rock and roll it's a pretty good glove if you ask me and you can see it's all coming out on the sides as well this is all just for personal use total press time on this is probably maybe three minutes maybe if that and I started out the temp at like 69 70 degree temperature just whatever the plates were when I started it up and just continued to put the put the puck in there and started just light pressure like I said until I started adding pressure and it all came out it's all ready to come out now as a matter of fact I was allowed - I've put all the pressure I could on it before I either rip the paper or do something stupid so [Music] give me one second I'll show you guys what it looks like alright guys this is what it looks like after the fact I did have a little tiny blowout right there in this corner right there a little bit I must have blew out this corner right here but the rest of it is pretty clean i'll see any contaminants other than a little tiny bit right here which i'll just it doesn't matter to me i'm gonna smoke it either way but everything else looks and pletely clean smells [ __ ] amazing until you get right there get down to the piece like I said it's separate it's just like pressing a bud just couldn't clean around and get the best you can the filter bags like I said especially when you go into pressing hash it's a it's it's all concentrate and it's all oils so you're gonna get way more than you would if you were to press flour and it heats up a lot faster because it's not as much material in the way as far as plant matter it's just hash and that's it and try Coneheads and lipids and whatever else is in there but yeah that's pretty much it guys and then these hash bags you can save them and press them again or you can you can just save them and once you get a good amount of them you can make butter or or edibles out of it you just drop them in a crock pot with some butter and that the whole bag everything and then it'll dissolve in the oil and it'll separate the oil from the whatever else is left in there as far as whether you're planting pressing plant matter or hash it doesn't make a difference then you sift it out with the cheesecloth and you can use that oil for anything it's gonna be decarboxylated and ready to rock and roll you can put it in brownies you can put it in cooking you can make tinctures you can learn about tinctures but you can make pretty much anything with edible wise tinctures I'm not sure how that would work I think you got to use the actual oil without any butter in there cuz I the way I'm telling you to do is use a unsalted butter or you can use salted it doesn't matter and then you just put about a half a pound of butter with with a quarter pound of chips or rosin pucks or however you doing it the more pucks you have the stronger it's going to be alright guys I'm gonna go ahead and cut this video off it's getting a little long so have a good day be safe and I stay medicated", "32iu-tGBgLk": "hello everybody and welcome back to cannabis crafting well there has been some things happening in here lately as you can see everybody is pretty happy like these are go strain haze up here that's my cookies cookies cookies Google strain haze go straight A's Blue Dream Blue Dream these two guys here are a real edge project I got going just check it out I've never revenged in a long time so I figured what the heck kind of just they've they've been neglected the last four days but I'm gonna play with them in a bit but anyways back to this stuff well these guys are happy as can be some are a little funny looking but I think that it's just strange specific because these blue dream here I got from my LP in a bag of weed that they sent me I got to blue dream seeds so I figured what the heck save them and we'll do them and then same with these ghost train haze here and here these were bag seed from my LP as well and these cookies these are cannot cookies and as you guys remember from the beginning it was supposed to be connect cookies and OB cush but when I germinated all these seeds at the same time at all the blue dream and the cookies and the OB and the blue dream and the cookies turned out OB died didn't even break the soil so I've put some ghost train Hays down that I had just to kill time and I've been waiting for Kanak to respond with if they're going to replace their seeds that were obviously you know no good to other strings germinate and that one doesn't you know I did the same thing and I just don't get it but I'm fighting with them hopefully I'll have these Oh bees in soon and maybe I'll be able to work something into a clone project of a novena cookies or something I don't know now because the seeds are just they're gonna be so far behind I just I don't know so I might do clone of a cookies and a clone of will be one and put them under HPS and LED one of each and see which one comes out the best I guess I'll have to be I think that'll be a little a little closer better project because then I can take a clone of the best of these three cookies and then hopefully when I get my three over cush seeds I can take a clone of the best of that and that'll be a little bit of a more scientific test so anyways just to let you guys know what's in this dirt it is a Spagna peat moss perlite seed starter from Miracle Grow I know foo but that's all they had and a Merkle's fish fertilizer and then I mix up a little bit a light mix of the chemicals well not chemicals the fertilizers that I used to feed to these guys and then I mix that in with the soil and I let it sit and then I water at one time with just some plain distilled water to reactivate everything oh yeah and there's eggshells in there as well because calcium is a big thing I found and yeah you know we're gonna see hopefully they'll take off like everything else I've done and yeah the cookies are looking great just imagine if I would have got those decent pair of OB you know set oob seeds we would have a pretty crazy grow on here and you know good luck would be looking pretty good instead of looking really stupid you know wonder how many other people they've managed to rip off over the years selling them bogus seeds with a satisfaction guarantee and then not fulfilling it like I dealt with crop King last year I had an issue with one of their seeds not working same issue you know it didn't germinate and it was more than three seeds and they sent replacement seeds no problem on top of that they sent stickers and in a hat to apologize you know and you know what crop king awesome Kanak seeds you know they're there's these are more expensive and they they have a guarantee and then they levy in the in the bush with nothing you know I'm so glad I didn't end up you know saying hey I'm gonna buy a hundred pack of these I've wanted to grow oh because for a while and you know oh well this is what it is so I'll be back at you guys soon with a new video and I hope you guys like it I hope you guys like these guys and that's my Reeve edge yeah and there's the death fan that guy got me in the elbow last night stings it's pretty rough so one last look oh and this guy he got trapped under one of these bar lights I'd like to give them extra blue light and as you can see it cooked it that's a downside when you don't grow in the same place you live I have to go over there every whenever and check on things and make sure everything's safe well it's always safe but you know make sure everything's good and I was gone for about 45 minutes and I come back and bang light sitting on on a plant to close and I got in there moved her out she's back doing good but you know so I can't wait until this boy law comes in I won't have to leave my house to go throw my medicine which would be very great you know yeah I'd love to be able to do things at home but I try to be a law-abiding citizen as much as possible I hope you guys are too you know we got to do the best we can to follow the laws even if they're ridiculous and you know not right we still got to try and follow them and until our leaders change them or our police they end up for us whichever comes first which I won't hold my breath I wouldn't advise you guys to hold yours so just try to be smart you know I am permanent everything's good but I still take extra precautions just to protect you know my sanity so there you go guys hopefully you'll be back in a couple days hopefully you like this video get it out there with my other ones leave me some comments let's get some dialogue going I don't know like let's go guys what I'm trying to get this OTO tell me what you want to see tell me tell me something that's a thousand water bulb right there pumping out some good light and that's ran on a 600 Gavita yeah everyone keeps asking me I don't know why you would do that and blah blah blah well you know what this why it's nice and cool in here heats down everything's looking good everything's growing good light spectrums nice the extra blue with the extra blue bulb so yeah you guys all take it easy thanks for your watching have a good one bye bye", "akyKHTB0qH4": "[Music] let's go youtube ministry boy man fellow signing him back with another video today I'm at Windy City cannabis it is a dispenser that sent home word you got to pick up a couple parts get wedding cake and I'm also about to grab our train Hayes or something like that but I'm gonna go grab two carts and then on my door review like usual although swaggy this way Corin C&I are some people like super cautious steel stick another wine but it's not as bad as when we go ahead last night he is why it shouldn't be much of a late a wait they got it like a little thing going on right now when you just you order online and then you get a time where you come pick it up at so I'm here at my time right now to pick it up I got the cards this is Ronald like I said wedding cake I'll just do some b-roll but another one ghost train hey that's what I got ghost train Hades I know something but I think welcome got like 81 percent to eighty seven percent I got both of them it was overall pleasant experience with the city Canada so give it like two thumbs up pretty simple I know this really fight doesn't matter to other people in other states it should like that because they're dispensaries aren't like that they don't operate like it's a banking [ __ ] but out here in [ __ ] Illinois act like the Spencer is our bank and you know there's like a security door behind a security door behind another security door what is good YouTube and we're back like I said I just got back from Windy City cannabis right now I got so this is what I miss using to smoke this is not a really cheap doesn't cost much at all pay my five bucks for it like I said ended up getting two carts I got like I said got wedding cake and the guy goes try and I used about 500 milligram how finally just short of what I usually do but this joint called and they don't costing me 65 on top of that I ended up paying my 75 attacks in other words so and I know what in other words robbery bro this is it right here waiting cake do some b-roll [Music] [Music] again this is Verano now use this sticks hit this [ __ ] that's that join us is it right here or on tone beep anyway this little thing screwed a [ __ ] in here reason why I got this one in particular could this convene I could just stick this in my pocket I'll take it with me looks to go it's smaller but yeah hey slow bro it's a smooth pen I just probably last me a month I use mine tickling too however they have much for you as far as like a player for flavor program which I taste this [ __ ] one more time I can't really taste much out of this I'm not really getting like a cake taste oh no matter like look up and let you guys know like whether that actually works I don't really taste nothing cake wise as far as like wedding cake but uh I do feel something is usually pretty instinct with cars it's just like this literally just like smoking flour which has been my experience still early just like smoking flour so yeah I just be starting to feel some already that first day I took what was pretty was pretty damn massive but yeah and that man I'm gonna let you guys know I like I said hey buddy taste it tastes just a bit sweet but I outside of that any taste nothing I'm for real but eighty percent THC it is a hybrid I saw an indica and sativa and yeah other than that miniature boy man I appreciate you guys supporting the content two channels still steadily growing steadily growing and I'm just nothing but appreciated appreciate it to you guys and I've been in my experience that Windy City cannabis I give it two thumbs up as far as like I had like a bad experience I went to security guard but outside of everybody was cool most people was cool just like one little bit it didn't really blow it I still recommend though they're cheaper than the ones are that's gonna say that cuz they have yeah overall great experience I give this to thumbs up with them filling it for sure outside that man should I pick although I'm out under that this pan yo and I feel like my face is melting off right now", "oorImfmzzCg": "[Music] hello people I just wanted to give you guys a quick look in my 4x4 throw tent we have some critical mass that one and also that one back there's critical mass I got a moonshine go strain ways clipping right here it's coming along I got a little one there is an OG push and a hash passion most these are all bike to knock seeds the critical mass the hash passion their connect seeds this Cinderella 99 are you here connect seeds as well I've grown a few their genetics Otto and feminized I like their stuff seems to be on the level to me we got them using 300 and we got 800 watt cob here we are at 80 140 for a little bit low on the humidity but yeah this is what's going on everything is going nice and healthy I just thought I'd give you guys an update I haven't been hot in a while see 99 was a clone as well as the moonshine go extreme haze in the back that's why they're a little further along but he seeds the critical mass and half passionate girl coming along quite well and the OG Kush was started a little while after as you can tell why the size but it's nice and healthy we have some older c99 drying over here normally the lights are off and so when he does then we have the moonshine ghost train he's an outdoor drying over here it's half clipped as you can see [Music] all right

[Music] [Music] [Music] he's pretty bad back so he got these guys on very nice hopefully you can see us it is really the word I'll just edit it out that's pretty good man kind of harsh yeah so guys you know big definitely definitely leaves the aftertaste on your top yeah I don't think it's his blunts cuz I haven't spoken these spots all week long and it's not like that it is like sparkling you know what that means they didn't flush it correctly they lost too many nutrients in it that's why it's sparkling when you hit it that's not normal this should buy gold leaf I really wouldn't recommend this one I don't think I mean it's not bad but if you're gonna pay top dollar alright better yeah you could only get better the hype my eyes are bad off I mean yeah it's beautiful it definitely is a good sativa it doesn't get you too much of a body buzz it's way more in your head on this one in fact if you've been smoking all day this one kind of wakes you up if anything alright man one through ten what's your school oh you know like a seven I'm gonna give it a six yeah I think it definitely could be better oh yeah I'm alright on it too we're not even gonna finish this bad boy yeah not worth killing it oh all right this is what you smokes let's chill man peace", "Qo5UrPVaZJE": "man i gotta i had to get this on video because if you only pick up so much on the photos this thing is so beautiful the ghost train haze number four across with ray charles it's actually a custom hybrid strain my friend happened to have a a ray charles get crossed with a ghost train hayes number four male and so he gave me the seeds and i uh i grew it from seed it's got some nice purple stuff going on from the cold weather but this thing these bloods are going to be i mean look at that one bud in the

I mean there's whatever idea whatever 240 watt or 400 light Gardens right strictly all for extract we've seen it cuz what do you extract or he had that with the death star right it was like a work for me a seven percent extracting strain awesome flavor and everything percent by weight yeah that means yeah throw an ounce in you're getting you're getting more than a quarterback Holly that's yes sir that's a producer I don't believe it guys somebody tell me wrong in the comments show me some stuff I guess I just called the extractor a liar but no when you're growing for rosin there's a couple different phenotypic expressions of the plant that you're looking for because the the main thing and we talked about this on Wednesday the plant waxes that make up part of the trichomes right different strains can have different like ratios of plant waxes to cannabinoids making up their trichomes and ideally you're looking for a very thin waxy cell wall around the outside of the trichome so that instead of there being a ton of waxes they're either extracting or are getting left behind and you're not yielding off of you're getting all cannabinoids coming out of this question here because what's up everyone I just purchased a new rosin press no smasher which we talked about before for you he's one of those little on one press is a pretty decent price I'm looking forward to playing around with it I have just read results from pressing rosin or I've just read that results compressing rather than have a lot to do with the strains my next girl will be a heavenly influence for pressing rosin so my question is what's at the strains work best for rosin pressed are there any type of characteristics I should be looking for in a strain and what will make for better awesome so this is about to pop up you see let me just kind of say what lemon because they put a lemon GF here right made a great a great some good information yep so just absorb this case says people say hash strains and things like gorilla glue number for supposedly high yielding and if you search for ever strange I don't even tell me that my whole life man what's that sorry I've been just trying to make commentary I'm just trying to fit in did any quality strain covered in a decent amount of visible trichomes should do well but the results can vary massively from different phenotypes and a strain pack of seeds from what I've seen with varying consistency of yields for each right so keeping cuttings of what performs is very important this is where you go back to growing if you're a rising grower you're probably not playing around too much with I'm gonna have you know you're gonna grow this ain't like a production grower you're gonna grow all the same strain to a degree if that's the one that really works for you but 11g F goes on this talks about different temperatures I appreciate this really good information the difference between a high temp and low temp and pressin and then I think a lot of people lean to for the most quality though pressing that bubble hash like one step further when you're making that bubble hash you freeze everything make your bubble hash like ice hash right our ice water hash and then you freeze dry the bubble hash that you've made so that you're locking in all those terpenes none of them are able to volatize off and you're just taking all the water out at freezing temperatures so pretty much then you can press that and that's like what they call live rosin you have a freezer oh are you making up things now I I do yeah it's been like three grand along the oKed I'll be right I've rosin I didn't even haven't heard that one yet new thing yeah the ice cream place but like I was saying the different phenotypical stuff you can look for in the plant and then there's hormonal things you can do to play with the shape of those trichomes and how they actually how they are there's certain like plant hormones methyl Jasmine 8 being wise jazz monic acid methyl Jasmine is just another name for Jasmine ik acid if you're using that in gibberellins and you'll have to do your own research and experimentation on this to find the right dosages and everything they can plant up they can [ __ ] your plants to where you have like footlong foxtails but if you use them correctly in the right dosages you can start to play around with the shape of that trichome and make it a bigger trichome that is also filled with more cannabinoids and with less of a waxy cell wall around it so there are some hormonal things the plants look like hell when you do this to them uh-uh like that they do foxtail but like completely out but if you think about it when a plants Fox tailing rapidly right it's putting trichomes all over the fire tail injure when we're we're not we're service that's right more surface area more trikes and as an extract grower we're not looking for back appeal on the plane at all it doesn't matter at all what we're looking for is the trichomes it could have annoyed terpene and flavonoid yield from the plan yep and we want to try and minimize the amount of waxes that are coming out with it because either that adds another step you have to do acts and clean up this the extract you've made or you're left with waxy paraffin waxes and that stuff people don't want in their shatter I was gonna say it if guru didn't matter I think we did it I think we covered it I like it you guys check out that post there's some really good information thanks lemon gf for contributing", "ohaLvBuhWTY": "yo what's up the sledge is back that's right just drying up a few of my trees that looked pretty damn close to ready treichel nice and amber I flushed it off for a minimum of 10 days it smells absolutely great in here you ask my wife she'd say something different but I love the smell everything is looking real good I got some ghost og curing in the jar I've had the pleasure of smoking a doobie or two and man it is good it's got a good kick to it good flavor good smell the smoothness is pretty good it just needs the extra days to cure and oh my goodness Pat there's a white ash test and everything so this is a short update hope you liked the video", "nQswmNoOKV8": "what's up everybody I'm back good morning good afternoon good evening whatever the time of day is that you are watching this video welcome back if you're returning viewer and welcome to the channel if it's your first time here so for today's product opening we have another product from color cannabis that is their ghost train haze so as we're looking on the site here when it focuses for you we have a package date of that got to be a 6 ok of June the 12th and it is July the 12th actually so it's been here in here for exactly a month the reason I know it's a six not an 8 because it's not August 2019 it obviously so of course you know with all the other ones we need to have an airtight seal to make sure that that's actually gonna be still you know do you simply moist I suppose you could say before we go any further trim mister scale on breakout mr. Honda Graham wait give her a nice little check and she's a hundred rate where she's supposed to be okay so don't bring off my cover put it up here zero it off time to get opening you know colors another one that decides hey work on that toss in a nice pretty colorful box just because it makes sense to be more wasteful than we already are anyway all right so into the top let's go and we have an airtight seal so that's always a good sign of course and this one looks like they must have been getting down to the bottoms of their ghost train because we got all tiny tiny pots you know not the best should be worse all right so this time remembering right off the start bring one up I think looks pretty nice all right give her a squeeze a little bit of a bass but not a whole lot which means is still holding some moisture in it and hasn't tried out too much didn't dust between two fingers I can get it apart if I really really try but it's gonna come apart nice and easy with three go tell me that it will break up decently with just your fingers if you don't have a buster on hand but of course if you have Buster on hand it's always good to you know I'll put it in that Buster so pulling out any tiny buds to do the way it's climbing decently see here ok so I'd say at about that point I'm getting most of my major buds out of there while this down dumped the remaining on here up there it's quite the pile that it gave me suppose you can call that a bud and call that a bud and we really want to start stretching and call these couple of guys buds but that's a lot of shake ish stuff there I'll move it all into the center to get the scale to calm down and even out it's definitely appearing that it is the correct weight it was picking up between all of it when I was moving stuff around hello it's trying it's unfortunately going back and forth between point three and point four I wonder really want to see if I can get this to actually go up to its proper weight it'd be ideal I don't want to have to say color is giving you under weight stuff let me know though it was only like a point one so I guess it is possible that it lost that point one through it trying note some even though it was air sealed and they don't tend to dry out very much with the air seal but anyway it's possible yeah so I'm getting three point four it's not going up a three point five it's not trying to go up to three point five none of the back-and-forth ticks so unfortunately this isn't impress is impressive it's the last few have been but at the same time you know it could be worse I suppose well yeah well it definitely could be a lot worse not the best not the worst but at the same time you know I'd rather see a polling fibre 0.6 on there at the end today there's no overpowering smell to this at all I can barely notice that I have that container open which is always a good thing because you know some of that stuff the moment you open it your whole apartment is just dank anyway guys until next time you guys have a good day", "vNyOgKIuxsU": "[Music] welcome back to terpiz in this video we'll be unboxing and part testing a pair of lights from atrium these two lights are the hydra 1000 model which each light covers a 2x2 growing space inside the box you'll find the user manual [Music] a six volt power cord the daisy chain cable which allows you to connect multiple lights together controlling them from a single light source pair of rope ratchet hangers for hanging your light inside your tent allowing you to easily adjust the height of it at any time [Music] a cable that allows you to remote mount the driver to a better location of your choice if you don't like it mounted on the back of the light three cable ties for hanging the light i'm not sure why you would need three for a light this size but having an extra is nice and lastly other than the actual light is a couple zip ties as you can see the light is packaged very well soft foam fully surrounding everything in the box along with the light inside a bubble bag keeping it separated from the accessories taking a first look at the light it seems the led board is mounted straight onto a flat piece of aluminum that is coated black with both of the dimmer daisy chain box and the xlg series dimmer mounted on the back flipping it over to take a look at the led board you will notice that leds are spaced out differently compared to most other leds on the market atrium states this is done to avoid hot spots and provide a much more even light output across the entire growing space the leds are a full spectrum consisting of a warm white blue deep red and far red leds each room did provide discount codes which i'll leave in the video description if you're interested in picking up one of these lights and want to save yourself some money if you're new to the channel i upload videos every week covering indoor and outdoor grows solventless extractions products and equipment so if that's what you're into hit that subscribe button and turn on the bell notification so you don't miss out when i post new content let's get into hanging the pair of lights inside the grow tent currently i only have a 4x4 grow tent available for this part test so we'll only be utilizing the back half of the grow temp allowing each light to cover a 2x2 base like atrium suggests there are more accurate ways of doing this part test but this will give you a general idea of the output and coverage at various different heights so you can reference this video when hanging your light to achieve your optimal par reading if you don't have a par meter since they can be rather expensive when first starting out don't forget if you're enjoying this video or found it all helpful to hit that like button it really goes a long way in supporting the channel [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] you", "4YT2GZj8UdE": "what's up everybody welcome back or welcome if you're just first tuning in today we are checking out kress goes cookie Cresco cookies a refresh hybrid this is a 1/8 3.5 grams it's the container it comes in this is how it comes there's a label here with um a little bit of information but otherwise in that it doesn't come with much information the um sativa is read the bottle is clear read and the indica is clear blue now I wish Cresco would put more information about these strains because I try to look this up and I found some information on the Girl Scout cookies which this is Girl Scout cookies but they renamed that Cresskill cookies but it's not found some information on the old name on it but I didn't find much information on the no.1 and I didn't find information on their website so Cresco if you see this video please put some information like the other manufactures or the other producers about distrain the prospective effects the profile terpene and stuff like that would be great if you got enough room on this piece 8 - is it comes with a humidity controller - way to give or pull humidity I've opened up some of these before and what I noticed sometimes - with that they don't hold a good seal and you can smell it out the package or the shake will get on the outside the room here but maybe that was just you know a bottle three specimens that was just one or two by yeah you definitely I could smell it out the bottle yeah so it's not airtight this one doesn't have much Akif there but the other ones I seen that had key fall on the outside here which is not good some of them are the shake ones oh wow that's weird it's like um it's like a spicy ash flavor and it looks kind of purplish on the video I wonder if it that's what it is I was just coming up like that you see all that purple it's very dark it has earthy and like our spices type of smell to it I don't smell any cookies definitely like a earthy and spicy well I would start let me take it out for this cuz you can't see it so good I've got to get a new rolling tray there or a new rolling bowl this one's too small and I gotta get it cleaned up it's got a key follow oh yeah well I wanna see I don't know it in person it looks dark but it doesn't look purple it just looks very dark but in the camera there it looks like purple you see that it's hard to see that in person though it just looks very dark but here Wow look at that you can see all the Keef on it too like whoa that's not good you see how the key flick right here on the purple all right see this one this one is green and this one here see if I could point that if that one right there yeah see those are purple there and then those soya green I don't know what's up with that definitely got a lot of Keef on there it comes in at 20% THC does like it would be more the definite this is not a pungent smell or nothing like that you know it's not something that just smell right away it's more like an incense type of smell or like a spices type of smell how much do we got let's see come on Crisco no right under find that maybe unspecial between on sale between 45 to 55 depending where you go test out a gram see what we get here I do the purple one I don't know if it matters or not but let's try the purple its definitely dry crispy okay maybe that's why they put I noticed all of them have this on the crest go bottles so maybe they put it to keep it dry to a certain to the 50 degree 50% humidity these are supposed to once they're hard they're they need to be replaced or they're no good this one feels a bit hard in there but it still feels a bit wet okay let's see I'm pretty sure it's gonna crush it did make questions huh Alma held a crush but stay together it's got some crush but it's staying to God it's pretty dense see yeah it's got some punch some crush there's still face and Uggs now that I break it up it has a little bit of a like a cushy smell to see let's see how much keep would get out of bear with me on the Camry guys I'm learning and then it's a process oh come on man don't send me I just pushed it down [Music] hey this one also it looks like it's gonna get a lot of Keith but I've been wrong before so we'll just have to wait and see but it just feels like it just dry enough it's crunchy this thick it's got a lot of Keef on it just sitting on it see it's got a little yellow round ball gonna sift that out I'm gonna posit here and we'll come back and see how much so this is the last of it first sometimes you could see through the screen there see in the inside but you can't see much it's got a cushy on the tongue smell which is attracted me to it I didn't like the spicy smell but the UM it's got a cushy undertone so I'm guessing when you smoking it you're gonna taste that pushy undertone is it taste good oh yeah nice not a lot lot but nice for a grant that maybe like point one so it's about 110 percent oh yeah it's only about point zero five you can see there it's only about point zero five point zero six it took that save that to the side that's what's good about having that grinder you can save the kief if you want make yourself a little pod a little puck I mean or save it or you know cook it or you can just put it right back into what you're rolling if you want three five this is I mentioned in the video two things that you want to get this is another thing as well there's like a bowl or a plate is another essential or like a rolling trays or a rolling plate or even just you see what I'm using at the moment nothing special eventually I'm gonna get a tray but for the moment I've been using this and it just makes stuff easier it's easier to pour easier to put back okay so this makes the fat this scale is sometimes kind of off but looks like this makes a fat J at point three so we're gonna be without that it may swish down I think it's gonna squish down like like other stuff I've had but if I can roll it J with gloves on you can roll a J period for those of you who can't or think you can't you gotta that's why I say use a grinder because everything comes out even and it's easier to roll as well it's easier to put in your bowl back your bowl evenly I may have to lick it this is what a plate or the ball comes in handy tool okay when you're rolling you see I'm dropping stuff on the table here put your bowl right on there what's your rolling and whatever you drop goes back for the next batch whenever you're ready again well you can stuff it into the end there make sure everything is even you don't want it I licked it too much there you don't want to look too much because you're gonna rip that paper so you can see what gloves it's not the prettiest but it definitely will do the job and it holds up alright so let's try this bad boy on let's see wow that's weird it's got like a berry like that cushy berry flavor but I didn't get that smell I got like a cushy smell but I didn't get like a bear it's kind of a berry cush flavor definitely you know it doesn't smell like what it smells like initially like when I first smelled it it's not like something with spices does seem like a smoother smoke it keeps turning off and it was kind of hard to hit at first so that maybe um I didn't put enough in there or I rolled it too tight it doesn't seem like it's oh yeah it's kind of tight okay so you may 1.35 in there and you don't stretch it out a little bit more or just open it up and don't make it so tight nice two thumbs up for me again another nice strain so you guys have a great day I hope you're having a good day already mine was okay now it's gonna be a lot better", "uiiyBZxyutg": "what's up homie murder bombs small tubes been a minute [Music] we here at the lab you know um yes that well like you can see it there's little circulator running that's recovering a run from the closed loop system but for right now we bounce in a little bit of dry [ __ ] just real quick nothing's nothing special just doing some quick bounce tech let me get that off here so it doesn't contaminate that just doing some quick balance tags you know it's been a long day i've run a little over four and a half pounds and i don't have any hash i mean i have somehow but i want different you know what i'm talking about so how is everybody how's your day going what day is it [Music] okay that's the this is uh 120 through 159 not the cleanest or anything just trying to just trying to get a little something together to rip with you guys oh we can't do it like that can't see [ __ ] um [Music] not bad huh for some midzies so you're looking to learn about some dry [ __ ] mojo jojo well then i i have wonderful news for you i uh i finished uh shooting and there's just a little bit of editing for the um second video in the patreon series and aside from that i had all this uh dressed up stuff out and i had some material that i was working with so i went ahead and shut up oh comprehensive driveshift uh tutorial-ish video really a sort of revisiting because i have uh i watched a couple of bubble man's um old videos and some john brothel and a d420k and i realized my dry sip tack is nowhere near what it should be and um well to give you an idea why i'm feeling okay about it i'll just show you here in a second we pressed some rosin we're gonna show you [Music] and what we're doing [Music] wanted to see what kind of a quality product i can get from this and still um this this will still maintain a pretty a really reasonable view um this is 120 through 1 49 159 dry sift but this is in a 50 micron bag um a little bit larger than i typically use for hash but not too let's see what we got right here again not not to clean just trying to bounce any particulate through the screen that's smaller than 74 micron obviously boom playing drum solos over here [Music] i tried to use the camera last time but i guess you can't focus when you're live on youtube oh [ __ ] can you guys see this not bad for how long you saw we just worked on it 519 canada here shout out to my dry sipped masters from the north marcus of course uh john six grams i don't know i guess i could weigh it should we wear it yeah we can wear it why not oops we do have a little scale right here anyway so shout out to whoever the hell this company is no more batteries [ __ ] it usb rechargeable scale and i charged i've charged it one time and i've been using it for almost a month all right so we're going to weigh this the easy way [Music] make it a little bit of dry ice sit and really i was just bringing you guys in to take a break with me but when i set up the stream i noticed i had all that sift on the screen and i thought you guys might like to watch that hey four grams 3.95 looked like more didn't it all right guys it's good yeah i am tired i'm ready to take a dab i'm not sure how much i'm gonna get done after that but i have put in a very full day all right um [Music] you guys wanna you gotta [ __ ] it i guess we could press this real quick i do have some wonderful things to show you that i pressed earlier today from some dry sift that i spent much more time with um so if this stuff comes out amazing i'm going to be a little bit disappointed because why did i spend all that time making that stuff nah it's just there's absolute technique that cannot be denied and then of course there's the advantage to you know fully mature trichomes very dry fully mature trichomes in a very cold environment with very low humidity i mean in that setting you don't even really have to be this very good at this thing with all your variables perfect like that you're gonna you're gonna get some decent hatch but for uh mojo that said in the comments there a little bit ago about getting some screens or recently got some screens for driving oh what's happening here guys i can feel just a little bit of loose sift that's around it you know i don't want that on the parchment obviously okay now where's the first one the one i'm on i don't know we'll see if we get any yold out of this this actually is some 160 160 to 249. huge very high micron hash i don't think we're gonna press that but hey let's see what happens with this step as a matter of fact i know i want to press this because [Music] we want to try to stream i guess by a little bit of dry slipping i meant a lot sorry sorry sorry let's go let's go let's go [Music] all right here we [Music] that's a go too close how's everybody doing how's everybody doing it was a little fluffy you know what that points to unfortunately a high uh count of a capitate and stocks so that's contentment um only only contaminant would have it looking so fluffy like that we both thought it was like [ __ ] when you said seven grams i was like yeah probably maybe even a little more and then it was half all right guys so we're gonna first press the uh which one is this i can't remember which one was the bigger bag now the bigger bag was the last one so this is the 120-159 this is the 74-119 i think yes this is the 70 419 that's the stuff that we thought was seven grams but it's actually get my big fat head out of your way [Music] [Music] should be ready to go whoa those are some big comments yo what up austin video is called miz uh mecca mccall man static oh yeah [Music] so i don't know who so so dare you you must not have been here for the beginning i was talking about the marcus um adding to your driveshift quiver that i watched about six years ago and then i revisited over this past weekend and it was a really it was a wonderful reminder um no we're not of course i didn't just do static tech i don't have the time for that right now just want to make some dabs [Music] no they're actually four thousand dollars so sorry to i'm sorry to so sir dirty i love your information i appreciate the help and everything but you're a little bit incorrect there brother um yes of course the video at least i well i mean bubble man pro had had published tutorials on full mel dry sift and static tech six years ago so that makes sense as far as the drying being done with a freeze dryer oh yeah sure it's a great way to do it but old school microplaning and and drying um on cardboard honestly if you know what you're doing if you know how to keep your room cool and dry it can be very dope aside from that even whether or not you're freeze drying or not you're going to have to microplane um unless you're just going to stuff chunks of well you know i have no way of doing static technique the same thing as you were thinking security i'd like to check that yeah oh of course we know that's v man yep it is you're absolutely right sir dirty it is very simple the uh well there's the [ __ ] [Music] oh he's always doing it dude that's that's all that's like every single day for solving this bacon big he goes live for like four hours at a time and washes and presses and you know all that that's what's up yeah so depending on if you want a pharmaceutical freeze dryer which for the record if you're going to get one through low temp um and we are we're only talking about harvest rate i am not going to speak on anybody or any other company's freeze dryer if you're going to go through low temp you're not you're only going to be able to get a pharmaceutical one and they're not and that's not 2 000. they do have a small freeze dryer that's like it has three shelves it's very very small if you don't need a pump or anything like that if i remember correctly i think it's uh we could just look it up i think it's like 25 maybe maybe 3 500 but if i remember correctly actually i think the medium one is because i was looking at the medium one with a pump and it was going to be right here just over four just over four grand i'm so interested in that uh [Music] i love it i love it um yeah i'm so interested in this static tech austin what you got what you got that's new yeah you and that's don't even get me started on that oil free clown so you know dope about fire fire driveshift if you accidentally [ __ ] around and get and get caught answering some questions on youtube and just watching your [ __ ] burn there's the 120 micron obviously buttered to hell because how long i let it sit on the press but i don't think it's gonna hurt it [Music] all right let's press the big one and then let's go take a dab and then i need to get the [ __ ] out of here but i like to say dear tate because it reminds me of joe dirk [Music] oh that's right yeah okay a moderator i understand i'm sorry i've been so into reddit lately you guys that it's just usually i mean bops are mostly moderators over there but anyway i get what you mean now you got a blue ranch when you go live with them and you help them keep [ __ ] together [Music] i know homie i'm waiting for my taxes to come back so i can make skunk man austin god damn it yo if you don't know anything about skunk man sam you actually don't even know anything about triceps and sir dairy that's you seem very knowledgeable and i don't mean to say that to be rude but i actually you're pretty knowledgeable so you probably know who scott manson is marcus himself bubble man himself shouted out to scott manson without skunk man sam we would be we'd be a long way behind in the full mount [Music] there we go there we go probably let that guy warm up for a little bit too long but that's okay that's the beautiful thing about pressing at 155 degrees you got a little bit of yeah a little bit of leeway looks like there's a couple of you in here hope you guys are having a good day i am wrapping up my work week we're trying to anyway i'm gonna have to come back tomorrow of course but here we go let's get a little bit of frozen banana dry sip hash rosin glow for you again remember guys i didn't really clean it we certainly didn't break out any static tech we're just trying to get some dabs for me to get going with skunk man sam is the [ __ ] man just i gotta say it again austin you know what's up hey thanks mojo i laven if you're old school weed too you remember brett mavericks using the static tech on a pool table with the playing card brett maverick used mavic was that that's that's long enough static tech ago that that's before uh i was seeing people regularly doing it with books and dvds and things damn see i knew we had some crossover man i love solving this bacon bank he's such a cool dude and you ain't kidding i do need a netflix series and i'm down for that pay too um but he is such a cool dude and i just like what he's about um i of course i'm i'm kind of busy doing the same same similar stuff so because of that you know oh i have the timer set for 90 seconds i'm gonna press a little longer than that it just we're probably about 110 right now um [Music] also i don't want to get too crazy with the pressure because i just want this to be fire i don't really care about you um that's a shitty thing to say yeah but solving this bacon baby's such a he's such a cool dude and he's just he just seems to be so like the thing i some people are like so you could say that but they're just so nice i don't get that with him i get to know [ __ ] from him i like that you don't need to be [ __ ] nice for me to be a fan of yours you need to be about your game and he is he's about his game i just don't know personally i get silly with trying to be nice to everybody again some presses you just don't [ __ ] care about the yield this was on the plant how long ago did we start streaming 21 minutes ago this was bud a little over 30 minutes ago now let's see here's our first press this is our one yeah this is the big microphone i think that stuff's going to be better 35 40 minutes ago for sure this stuff was flour in a plastic bin in a tupperware you know what's that you know what time it is only i had a [ __ ] rig ready over here [Music] better not take forever geez my desk is messy i'm so sorry you guys let's uh just bring you in on about that much of it so you don't have to look right at all oh i know what i want to show you so that's the this is a little bit of frozen banana dressing pass rosin that we just pressed together we made it [ __ ] around with the card didn't that card moved it around a little bit let some of the let's let gravity do most of the work for us and uh there we got those two processors from it i couldn't absolutely get a second press and i will later earlier today what did i press oh this is nightwing so here's some night queen dry swift rosin that i pressed a couple hours ago and this is the second press i never [ __ ] with second presses unless it's good hash good hash will press two sometimes even three times if you're not if you're if you're doing short presses or whatever if you're [ __ ] it out you shouldn't have to press it three times but anyway i just want to share that a little bit a little bit a little with you we got some super fire rosins for dab on and um we made them all from the plant to the parchment ready for the bag and it's just 45 minutes tops where are you where are you oh you guys wanna get silly little slurper dab i just saw the case over here don't do that that's how you lose a marble all right guys i gotta have that gauge up all right how we doing how we doing how we doing just so you know i can't see you and i have no idea what the hell is going on but i love you guys [Music] [Music] all righty then [Music] let's uh let's start this [ __ ] off right i'm going to start it off with that second press from the uh from the night queen oh [ __ ] i forgot that i'm working one thing [Music] and by working i mean taking a break i like to take a break about every six to eight hours yes i do work 12 hour days 10 to 12 hour days today is going to be a pretty short day though i'll be out of here i'll be out here right around 10 hours um anyway yes we'll slow down the recovery there a little bit so i can play with you guys for just a minute come on guys i think i just want to look at the picture of that deer pooping now so again give me something let me know what's up give me something to read in there sir dirty had all sorts of good information i do i hate that i'm so uh contrarian and so oppositional and i'm sorry about that but it seems like sometimes like somebody i mean regardless of whether or not he's right about the price we can agree to disagree or just look it up or whatever but i don't know why i have to oh no you're not right he [ __ ] cares if any of us are going to buy a freeze driver we'll find out by the time we check out you know what i'm saying you know what i'm saying there we go that blazer though all right so we're going to start this off with a excruciating dab of the night queen second press tricep hashgraph oh i barely even smoked last night i certainly haven't smoked anything yet today i've been working for since 10 when it's about 7 30. [ __ ] i'm at nine and a half hours now it looks like it's gonna be more like an eleven-hour day whatever where's that second graph that's not it that's not it that's a good problem to have right you like that you guys this is the other reason why i want to do a dab with a second press to start and you might be able to pick up you guys having fun watching me let me watch when i finally get my youtube page pulled up here on my laptop i'll be sitting here by myself i mean i don't know how anybody wants this [ __ ] i gotta be [ __ ] annoying as all hell but i love you guys and i love sharing my little bits of knowledge about how to make hashish with you well and don't worry guys if i knock this rig over digger gave this one to me um for court sales i want to say three years ago so it's a decent ring but it didn't cost anything surprise says oh that's me right there i was like i call myself a surprise set all right here we go oh that's that's actually a very big dab already cheers ladies and gentlemen oh my god i'm not even gonna be able to dab the president that's some night queen and really it's like trim then keith that i threw over a screen real quick and it was so terpy i almost couldn't even i really whoa that must be good where there's the very turkey dab one of you what whatever mcafee any cheers come on dude my antivirus pop up was cracking the comments and then thank you elite uh 27 m uh 27 32 and four and that's for the regular and that's in us dollars iso um but that's just a regular freeze driver it is a food grade freezer option but it's not the pharmaceutical ones which have way way way more um options and settings that you can play with as far as dry times dry times depth of vacuum temperature sublimation is a really amazing thing got me by the nose it really did too man it's like uh and honestly that's the oh that's the second press um mixed micron or whatever it didn't it doesn't have a very clean melt to be perfectly honest with you i'm a little less than impressed with that there's absolutely no char or particulate or anything it's just a little darker than i think it should know anyway let me set this down over here or not shut this down oh man yo night queen [ __ ] give me a break jesus i have never experienced that strain being that loud before um i i've washed it and pressed it i have some sugar of it it's just amazing but never had that happen jesus this frozen banana [ __ ] looks amazing this is not frozen now that's good man all right there we go now this should be the bee's knees wait that's the night queen again i can't do that it's definitely gonna be good that's the 120. the 120 to 159 oh all right here we go no he said it was 2k for a freeze driver and it's 2700 and if you're in canada that's more like three um so he was off by 50 number one and then number two that's if you if you have a pump if you need a pump too it's more unless i'm mistaken if that's the price with the oil pump the other thing is that anybody trying to get one of these to use it in a setting like i'm trying to use it in is not looking for an oil-free pump the oil free pump is like an extra six to eight hundred bucks so at that point it's 35 for the small one and for the record that freeze dryer is so [ __ ] small you're gonna be pissed at yourself for spending three thousand dollars on something that small when you could have spent four thousand on something that is significantly better but still goes back to my point i just i don't know why i always got to be right anyway that's fair and honestly that's the thing is if it's a thing to waste and you're like a hobbyist or whatever damn you're really going in on your hobby but for me i look at it as like well why would i spend two to three grand on something that then when i recoup the value for it it's too small so i mean um freeze dryer is on the schedule not sure what size i'll be getting but we'll see you know what's up it really does man what kind of class is on a dab right what would i say and then aside from that hello annie yeehaw right man damn i [ __ ] but i'm almost scared to go in on another job but we got but number one i need to wrap it up and number two come on jesus man i got dab sweats and [ __ ] my gloves all hashy man jesus and my hands are clammy now because they were in the glove that's probably why i was so hot it couldn't have anything to do with that dab i just took i'm sure it had to do with the gloves all right ladies and gentlemen you know how much i love you um i mean if you don't know who's being silly if sir dirty's still here let's haven't seen a comic i'm gonna walk but if you're stupid still here looks like we're going to split the difference um we're both no i mean to be fair i don't know i don't know actually i don't know about that before i think i just said they're not too um but also i was speaking about the pharmaceutical freezer regardless it is the morton salt girl except it's the morton salt girl taken and done by slinger which marble slinger is a glassblower but then he takes it and he puts an assault rifle in her hands and we have a salt girl that makes sense and this is a special february edition this one's called oh this one's called rain and blood that's right that was the other thing the slayer rain and blood um yeah i love slinger [ __ ] um but this is a this is the picasso version of the design super cool first time i saw it i was like that's like a morton salt girl and then i realized he's holding a gun and i'm like a salt assault like a salt oh god and i've been in love with it ever since because i'm an old nerd and when i see some [ __ ] like that and i think it's cool i never get over it jesus christ look at this [ __ ] frozen bananas you guys it's on was he i didn't know that was i didn't know that was with it but at the same time i was too you know hope you're still here if you're still here let me say something um that's what i was saying about the split the difference oh my god look at that melt you guys need to see the color this rosin is melting into uh [ __ ] dude i went in hot we went in just under 600 degrees holy [ __ ] you guys whoa hey what's up austin my homies in the northeast you know i love you i'm saying that a lot of them anyway that is a beautiful amount and if we were if you remember i was out of the right micron bag so i had to press that at 50. that's the 74 to 119 pressed in a 50 micron bag almost like the same size um you know not really but just a little bit so the fact that i knew that was going to be a little charry or maybe dark on the end as it did get a little char charlie when it dried up or finished but i cannot get over the color of that when it melted down was [ __ ] beautiful and it maintained its color for a minute tastes great tastes great it's a very interesting terpene profile um very very unique for me uh well you guys know it's got to be unique for me because every time i take a dab or a hit of anything i [ __ ] cough for 10 minutes and cry and that isn't happening so it must be different all right guys i was going to say have a great day but that dad was so [ __ ] delicious so delicious just like dog food tastes exactly like it smells delicious all right that's the low mic that's the that's the mids frozen bananas compared to this because this is way way way larger micron hash pressed out of a 50 micron bag so this is certain oh my god what do you guys think drop it i don't know sorry guys this [ __ ] is and i'd like to smoke something with some of my homies back home in missoula how is annie doing man thank you mom um reached out to me about um tincture help for either a sick person or a sick dog or i can't remember exactly but i wasn't able to find the uh micro encapsulation article i was looking for anyway uh it's been a while i'm glad you made it over so if anybody has the chance to try this strain frozen bananas this is my absolute first very very first experience with it [ __ ] uh don't get me wrong the guy that i the guy that i work with is an incredible brother absolutely incredible of the highest calorie so you know if you get your wheat from somebody that all the strains look the same don't be necessarily excited about frozen bananas it might not be that different this is very very exciting for me because it's so different than what i'm used to eddie peace 340. well that means it's 6 40 in california and almost 10 o'clock on the east coast cheers ladies and gentlemen that's exactly how you spell it with a k and one l oh my god wait you guys know i like that i like the flare for the dramatic but i tend not to exaggerate especially not when it comes to ash no cap definitely some of the best cash i have had hashtag that i've smoked so far this year period i don't care if it's from a hyperzone maker or if it's from the dispensary down the street this frozen banana ah find me um 120 to 159 the micron is dry ships hash rising is [ __ ] wild i cannot explain this taste to you guys i guess it is kind of mild like the way a banana is like a mild fruit but yo for real grizz that's what's up man austin where are you that's super cool yeah caspell's though also california's the only town county whatever it's the only place in montana that has a chick-fil-a so if you know what i'm talking about when i say there's nothing quite like the taste of [ __ ] hate oh you can only get it in council i got jokes open your heart let the hate out oh oh you guys i gotta lose some weight i gained weight during quarantine and then i just uh gained a little more love to michigan oh good luck with that because to be honest with you this is the problem the dab before this one i was supposed to quit and get and just finish what i need to do and be done but this [ __ ] is so good man so good nah anyway i hope you all have a wonderful week and hope you all have a wonderful weekend uh for those of you that are patrons or interested in becoming a patreon i'm sorry for those of you that are interested in patreon or are already patrons um i published uh one of the first of an eight video series um a couple days ago i've i have minutes maybe an hour left of editing for the uh part two part three is going to be wild it's going to be a celebration so far we're all only into hydrocarbon content but episode four if you can't tell from all these parchments around me is a dry sift and dry sift pressing episode so we got content coming go over and check it out if you like i and i say this because i encourage you those of you that are interested to just to go over and check it out it's you certainly you know pick the tier that you want with for whatever much you want to support me if you if you don't really give a [ __ ] about that and you just want to see what but what's up with the videos or if they're worth the money whatever then just do the small one you know either way you get to see with everything i just ask that anybody that has the ability and has any interest in helping to support me does that like mr david brazier has been like a [ __ ] high-level tear patron for a year and i mean i've while i think he's i think he's the longest that couple a couple of you guys have been rode with me and it's amazing but mr brazier from alaska i think he absolutely holds the record yes sir i'm gonna try i know this much up until um when i came to work today i had always had some hats you know what that or some oil or whatever but didn't really have any fire rotting feeling like my weekend's gonna be pretty sweet now let's get it started right cheers ladies and gentlemen after this i am gonna rock and roll and go ahead and finish my day pardon me i do encourage you to check out patreon if you're interested in processing a tutorial um hash tutorial but essentially processing tutorial content if you want to learn how to make some stuff make some high high quality stuff uh like there's there's a lot i number one i encourage you if you're gonna get into it to get a notebook my videos are you think my videos are long here the number two that's being published should be published tomorrow it's one right now i think i'm going to be able to knock down another couple minutes so if i should be able to get it to around one hour and 50 minutes it's just under two hours it's a [ __ ] movie i mean but it sucks and it's not entertaining however the amount of information in it is is probably pretty valuable um again check it out if you're interested if you're not i'm always here on youtube you can always email 710.consultations gmail.com you can always email the 7th extractions at gmail.com you're interested in booking a consultation and i'm actually i'm commenting from my 710 consultation so there it is 710.consultations gmail.com or you can text that number if you're interested in booking a conversation and for those of you that are interested in going over and checking out patreon that's great because i feel like i owe so much to the people that have supported me over the last year and the amount of content i i just fell short on being able to publish on time at all um i have this very very very comprehensive eight video series that i'm working on now and when it's finished it may be more like nine or ten videos but when it's finished i'm definitely going to turn off enrollment for a while um it's i uh it's hard when you finish a ton of content and then you need to get back to you know to work and or whatever you're doing and you have a new patreon patron or a subscriber or something come in and then you know their first question is when are you going to post something and i'm going like in my mind i'm thinking like i'm not even trying to shoot anything for a month so it's it's uh it's an interesting thing i'm not the kind of i'm not the kind of uh creator on patreon that like has a podcast going or anything that you would want you know that you check out regularly but there is a significant amount of information available to you right now and when i'm finished my a video series the amount of information that's available to you for the cheapest monthly subscription which is insanely cheap i think it's a pretty good deal i wish somebody would have put all that information together for me and been like give me a couple bucks and you can watch all these videos for a month all right guys yes you're absolutely right i didn't want so austin thank you um as far as things like if you might be interested in them like merchandise uh some personal time with me one-on-one stuff like if that's the kind of thing you're interested in there are some advantages to the opportunities but cheers ladies and gentlemen frozen bananas oh i'm under the same name i am everywhere brother however i do think it is all just one word i don't know why i spaced that either jesus that [ __ ] is so good i want to try a dab of it and save peace and kill the stream and that's my third day oh i love you guys but i gotta get back to it and get it wrapped up again i hope you have a wonderful weekend should anybody have any questions comments concerns anything feel free to go ahead and throw that in the comments section below and aside from that if you have any uh interest in a consultation inquiry you can email 710 dot consultations at gmail.com or you can text the number that i wrote in the chat 406-500-6698 peace", "b6FkdnCegxs": "[Music] every day in this industry is like a brand-new adventure it's so dynamic with there's so many different paths that you can guide a company like we'd envy down in so many different ways in which we can evolve as a company and continue to get better I think the important thing to remember is that the roots of this industry are in medical the medical industry is what drove this forward it was the medical needs of patients in this country that have evolved and created this industry there's so much happening that you have to almost take a very basic approach and say how are we gonna succeed as an as an organization as marketers we wanted to build a brand that made you feel good and made you happy and you know you felt you could connect with and you'd walk away with an experience that was positive color cannabis has really done that with a bright optimistic and very open mentality color cannabis exists to help the world be more open to what cannabis means for them it's optimism and trying to figure out you know what this plant actually can do for the world and you know we talked about how do people make the most out of their lives and you know a higher standard of living is unique to each person and I think that means you have to think about what are the moments that you appreciate the most and I think openness allows you to figure out what those moments might be ultimately people have really unique experiences with cannabis and they're different and individual to each one of them and how can we champion them as the users versus trying to tell them what cannabis is for me it's a really personal experience and I think we want to stand for those personal experiences versus over to find them we have a little bit of everything so there is a little bit for everybody we have chosen those winners of the past and those winners are still shining in the lp system we had two strains in the top five it's been a decade and a half for sure of hard work just to get the screens that we have here at we empty all the equity and everything that we've created in our grow that we're excited about all those best practices that have given us the quality that we're so well known for nothing's changing that's the product that's going into color Canada this world is no longer at the world of 50 20 10 years ago and so color cannabis is weed MDS approach to this new world in this new environment it's so multifaceted it has so many different applications that again the opportunities are almost endless", "i5fuNWGBVhg": "welcome to marijuana etiquette today I will be sharing with you the top five rated sativa strains number one and Misha haze honestly out get this strain not be number one amnesia haze is an all-time favorite and Amsterdam's coffee shops and quickly became one of the most recognized TV strains of all time amnesia is no random name for this haze indeed under her influence you might have a hard time keeping track of you're trying to thaw while she is incredibly inspiring and creatively boosting she is one of those strains with which you can come to realize the ultimate purpose of life but then forget about it she has a unique smell that's easy to remember sweet and lemony with a balanced earthy undertone with an average THC content of 22% and Mia haze can take you to the other side after all she's one powerful mistress number two Cali miss Callie mist is a very well-known almost pure sativa strain that comes from the master breeders of serious seeds she delivers a very strong energetic and clear minded high one that is said to be particularly enjoyed by women Cali mist has a sweet and nutty taste that induces a very potent high the THC content of Cali miss tends to be in the region of 22% so you know she is one of the big players number three Sour Diesel Sour Diesel is one of the original sour strains and is one of the few sativa dominant varieties Saira diesel is behind the success of our Sara strains that have become so popular recently this smelly powerhouse is the parent of many hybrids so if you like sour she's the big mama as you would expect the bud has a very earthy sour and jet fuel like taste with pleasant pine undertones while her THC content of 16% is a bit lower than that of the other contenders she still packs a punch the high is long lasting strong and mind centered without any body effects whatsoever number four trainwreck as the name suggests she's a heavy hitter with almost 90% sativa Genetics she will induce an intense cerebral high that very slowly fades out however what sucks trainwreck apart from other sativa strains is her indica body load along with the cerebral stimulation she will almost death we find you to the couch and tingle through your limbs this rather unique combination is the reason this strain is a favorite among medical users it's a complete high with a cerebral Rush and physical relaxation the bud has an earthy pine quality to it and produces a zesty lemon undertone with a THC content of 18% trainwreck is a respectable sativa that will surely satisfy number 5 Jack Herer Jack Harris an old-school sativa dominant strain that has gone down in history as one of the most decorated and renowned strains ever named after the activists in cannabis Paragon Jack Herer there could be no other fitting strain if you're looking to see what premium old-school cannabis was really about with 55% sativa genetics Jack Herer isn't as pure of a sativa as the previously presented strains and yet it induces a superb clear potent and happy cerebral high the but itself has a predominantly pine flavor with strong woody and earthy undertones it produces a very potent high that both encapsulate the best sativa and indica effects you can expect a strong and clear head high that will leave you happy and uplifted whilst the indica affects simply and gently lower your body into bliss the THC content of Jack hair can vary between 20 to 24 percent so it is definitely a strain for those who need some power this concludes the top 5 sativa strains list thanks for watching please comment like

production facility let's take a quick tour of the life of a modern medical cannabis plant come with me so we've just entered the hallway of Aurora's fifty-five thousand two hundred square foot production facility in addition to the ten flowering bays we have we also have several other rooms that support the life of a modern medical cannabis plant let's go into the first one the lab back in the day a plant used to start with a seed a pod and some soil today at Aurora we are the only licensed producer utilizing plant tissue culture as the beginning of the production batches here at thus laminar flow hood a technician takes plant tissue cleans it cuts it and places it into a sterile petri dish where it grows roots and shoots before heading into the next room follow me because the cannabis plant has several stages of life we need several stages of rooms that support every stage of life each room were growing in we're going into has different humidity and temperature and lighting requirements you'll see instead of a plant being in a container with soil it's actually in an agar solution or seaweed with certain plant hormones and nutrients which stimulates the plant into growth behind me you'll see the old way of cultivating plants with a mother from whom little cut cuttings are taken and germinated into pots just like this and the next stage is following let's go take a look at one of Aurora's 10 flowering rooms this room we're going into is w1 we have a West Wing and an East Wing and here in w1 you'll notice a strain called grape la it has about two or three weeks left before we harvest it and bring it into our dry dry room this room has several hundred plants in the room sizes range from several hundred to several thousand plants you'll notice the high-tech lighting tables in sanitary conditions that the plants are grown under clean floors clean benches and every room has its own recycled air no fresh air is brought in from outside all of this is to ensure the integrity of the product or clients get so follow me and let's go see the next stage of a cannabis plants life or the vault where we saw our dried medicine the key thing about the vaults in a licensed producers facility is it's meant to deter theft our vaults you couldn't break into it if you tried concrete walls smoke alarms fire alarms motion alarms and even add a gate once the main vault door is open you're not getting into this unless somebody lets us in come on let's see what dry cannabis looks like so here in my hand protecting it from white heat and temperature is about $8,000 worth of medical grade cannabis over here already packed up is one of our most popular varieties corkle and today we just package container number 33,000 not bad for just starting sales in January let me show you what happens to these after they're bottled up it comes into here where our fulfillment team takes your package boxes it up gives you some beautiful stickers some information from Health Canada and then we send it off either same-day courier Health Canada or Purolator direct to your doorstep", "8zkOOQz02xk": "all right all right we're back and I got my next box of cannabis from the OCS and this one's a big one folks they're a whole bunch of stuff I'll go over the prices and the different strains that I got through this video and then we're gonna do a couple videos on the review of the strain so it should be exciting let's just dive right into it okay so it's the same box that I got last time nice and small I doesn't seem to matter how much you order it seems like they're just gonna send it in the same size box same thing no smell with the box closed actually not too stinky this guy okay this is my packing slip just so you know I ordered up one two three four or five started one two three four five six seven eight different things look see all that boom boom boom boom okay so this is some WAP up we're just gonna look at all the boxes first line them up here this is a Casablanca pre-roll okay just line them up here this is the tangerine dream this is the pink push this is the supersonic or a supersonic eat super sunny if you're French this is some Dream Weaver this one I like it's called solar power boom boom just stack these up this is quite the haul and last but not least it's called the alien dog I'm going to break open a couple of these let's pull them all out and they get always the safety notification here come up standard in every single one alright let's just dive right into it and we'll lay it all out these all up like that now let's start with the tangerine dream ok I'm gonna pull this it says push push in table well there's two safety tops to push and then I gotta pull it out somehow just go right up this is their version of the childhood lock when it comes to the box packaging ok so there it is there with a nice little look at that it's the tangerine dream this alien dog oh that's a big container you guys talking about over packaging this is part of the problem the nice thing though is it's probably all recyclable so guys throw your cardboard out and plastics respectively wow that's some nice and up there got pretty that guy is the lid off there the pink push now this one has the highest THC rating at twenty point four seven percent this stuff was not cheap this one I paid almost thirteen dollars a gram for it and I just ordered a simple gram because I wanted to kind of cover as many different strains as I could okay that's the pink push that looks really nice I'm gonna give you guys a nice little view after we open it all up I love to see all these different packages I gotta understand why they can't just all package at the same weight I think it really matters [Applause] this is the pre-roll I'm opening Wow look at that you know what I only paid six dollars for this so I wasn't expecting a massive joint and I sure as heck did not get a massive joint but Wilson risk hope that one tonight and test that one I'm opening now the flop ah this one has a THC level of 18.8% now this is kind of interesting I haven't seen a package like this before the little guy that kind of looks like a camera roll you know from when we used to have cameras actually to print photos off of it's like oh yeah mm-hmm they're just in there take it a couple of mugs it's got kind of a cheesy smell to it very crystally inside I like that little package though it's very neat I'm opening now Dreamweaver this one came with a torn open I don't know if there's a little bit of a glue on the top here that's stuck but it was partially open it smells nice but you know what not as strong as I was expecting I'm now opening the solar power just now kind of swaggy if you ask me like kind of all these little mugs slick you know whatever not great but you're busting it up and putting in a joint anyways so not gonna be terribly thank you considering it's all legalized now and last but not least we're going to open up the supersonic as you can see here quite a haul but in total this always seven point five grams so the biggest half quarter I have ever gotten has been from the government and look at all of this packaging now that is a respectable nugget that's the largest nug I've gotten from them everything else is pin tiny very nice but very earthy you'll see if it comes out any good see how it smokes anyways there is the hall that is the second shipment I have gotten from the government now I ordered this on Friday got it today it is Tuesday can't complain without a lot of people I've had a lot of issues getting their stuff so our 18 days now and they still are not seeing anything at all I have not had that misfortune I don't know if they've seen the video and are like hey send this guy his weed promptly but regardless here it is now we're gonna go smoke some of this and I'll review it in a couple other videos if you like these videos want to see more always like and subscribe I appreciate it and I'll see you guys soon", "eeTmthyCdVI": "[Music] you're watching The Breakfast Club [Music] morning everybody is DJ envy Angela Yee Charlemagne to God we are The Breakfast Club we got a special guest in the building from the west coast Berta whatever they say you do we man bruh man you know what I definitely been in the game for a minute dick intense so you what you've got a lot of dispensaries or what is you know I'm responsible for the you ever heard of Girl Scout cookies or gelato yeah yeah yeah so we we're responsible for that besides the dispensaries we created our own flavor profiles so said just a stray and cookies it became a staple strain you got oh gee cush you got Hays you got things they'd been around for a long time Sour Diesel cookies kind of became its own phenomenon and we bred a lot of things with it just kind of created daily [ __ ] on you brah oh my god let you smell I just need to let packed and away and the reason he sends it well I'm not gonna say send it in that pack you can't smell anything so look this this is like cookie t-shirt so I want to educate your nose today please saying this is the lemoncello right here hmm okay any use notice right there like some new flavor Febreze man I should just so amazing it's the same it's like an indigo it's actually a hybrid it's a lemonade and cherry pie so lemonade sativa cherry pie kind of a hybrid I can't do the tea with steel makes my anger a lot of roof yeah yeah that's gonna be your best friend nothing to go yes you know smoke this tonight and just be on the couch watching narcos feeling good yeah oh that's me oh man thank you my brother god bless you in everything you know this is called the snow montana right here so something you know to Bay Area okay this [ __ ] right here stupid - OH so if you notice they're all so different that's what we do we create menus we master we mastered the menu hello to you 34 it's so weird being 40 and seeing how marijuana is packaged now it's weird you know it's weird I used to take I used to take a sock and stuff a couple zips in it and hide it in my pants and fly from the bay to Arizona when I was 16 15 Wow so from going to that - this is crazy and how cutthroat this business is the legal weed market it's like the dope game times 10 let's talk about it how did you get into selling marijuana you know against illegal business um I was always like an enthusiast with it I always loved to love the herb and uh when I was 18 the first thing I did was get my cannabis card and so growing up in San Francisco you see since 1996 they'd have dispensaries open people coming out these brown bags that smell so crazy and brownies dollars so as soon as I turned 18 I got my card I started going to the club and I was working at a coffee shop at the time and bartending I was a bartender at 18 and I was working at the coffee shop selling weed out the coffee shop and I came in one day and the lady owned the store she liked young dudes she only got dudes working there and she was like you look ridiculous in that coffee outfit you want to come work here I'll give you X amount of dollars an hour and so I started working at the front door did you have to [ __ ] it oh you know what you know I you know the feds actually asked me that getting off the plane to be honest with you you know they actually asked me if I was sleeping with her and if I was helping get money back and forth to Jamaica I was like you're out of your mind I would not hit that I'm sorry my dick has standards but from there I moved out quick from just doing intake at the door to work in the counter and selling the bud bud tending to actually run in the shop when I started buying the weed so let's say you come in I burn I got a pack of some-some super Silver Haze at the time I would negotiate the price and put it on the shelf and be responsible for making that shelf that's how I really got in the game being able to establish those contacts at that age eighteen to find plugs to buy bulk and to really design a shelf and to really know what's good what's not good how to get them prices good and make a little extra on top off the margins I started realizing man is [ __ ] is crazy when did you know it was gonna be like a major industry in the United States not always knew it was gonna be big just because when I was working at the club you have no off-duty cops coming in you'd have nurses you'd have all different walks of life coming in the diversity and the herb game is crazy so I knew it was gonna be big and that's why we created cookies we're probably one of the first brands to ever put a logo on the herb so what is Sour Diesel who is Sour Diesel we don't know gee cush that's real nobody knows who's super who's Blue Dream so I was looking at the Shelf like nothing she has a logo one day big alcohol is gonna come in here and they're gonna buy a brand and [ __ ] that I'm gonna get in i'ma build a brand so I was kind of the goal early early early to build a brand now you gave Wiz his old strat yeah I bless him with the cake a few yeah some that was the OG Kush cut I've had for many years in the Sunset District San Francisco and I was bringing it to him as a homey and he loved it I said you know what that's you that's you had it I smoked KK at uh and I thought my thought was yeah and it's like it only took like two puffs and I don't smoke like that I literally did nothing so the KK is a South Florida oh gee that's what's in the Girl Scout cookies and that's what is used across up all that so there's snow Montana is a South Florida og with the Girl Scout cookies that's that's that and so it's in gelato it's not it's a it's definitely stable and our menu for so what about edibles I'm scared edibles me tuber then things [ __ ] me up and I've had to take some of the biggest rappers in the game to the hospital off edibles really yes like legitimate they come to the bear back in the day is coming to dispensary and economies like New York Cass - I mean I'm on the way to the spit oh come with me I need to know what I took of my the edibles it's a real body high so we go outside and smoke a joint right now you it's it's mental you could kind of turn it off if you need to but when that drummer boy starts hitting that chest so you start filling that [ __ ] you start tripping off every feeling in your hands and your toes toes your air yeah that's that's what that's when the problems come scared edibles but they're a big seller though if what you said about smoking being mental is very very true cuz you know when you trippin you can just say right um hi you just say look I'm high and I'm I feel this way because I just smoked some weed and that's where I should feel yes yes yeah definitely not so much you wrap it out how do you into the rap game how did you start rapping so the marijuana was yeah so at the same time like at the same time I was working at the coffee shop you know was I was recording on the 8-track and just I'm a fan of music before anything and some cats that came up you know barrier rap cats and they were buying weed for me and they're like oh you know you're pretty nice with the free sales well not come down and battle some [ __ ] at this little coffee shop that's down the street from my spot it's like Haight Ashbury district so I started battle rapping people and then you know at the time I had a good amount of money from trappin I was like you know I'm gonna go ahead and put some music on [ __ ] with it cuz I'm a fan of it and it led to you know Rico was my thirty first album I put out and it's interesting because as an independent artist first of all I own my whole catalog thirty-one albums all solid bodies of work I look at it like a polo shirt it's timeless music it's not like it's not like a like a wave like a kind of like a pipe and sound of music it's just it's real timeless real [ __ ] in the 31 albums I put out I've only progressed you know I'm saying and so I just did as a passion instead of going out and try to chase charts or trying to get on on the radio or trying to do [ __ ] that people want to hear I did [ __ ] that I wanted artists I grew up listening to I worked with with people I wanted to work with and I put them on beats that I wanted to hear them on and that's been the key to my successes is doing it like that and also you know a lot of cats talk about selling weed and selling dope and they glorify it it's a really dark lifestyle I've been through some [ __ ] like some real [ __ ] and so I feel like that Lane is wide open for me right now where it's like when you really could talk to people that could relate to that [ __ ] and you could really preach that [ __ ] and it's real and it's genuine and people do their homework and they understand that what you're preaching is real there's not a lot of people are doing that right now people talk about selling dope people whatnot but we tell different stories we tell like stories that people who really really relate to you know why don't you have a problem talking about it don't let you talk about selling drugs so free you know it because statute of limitations is real I've been good I've been good for a while you know saying when I had my daughter my daughter's 11 when I had my daughter I was getting [ __ ] with by the feds they pulled me off the plane at LAX counting my money they thought I was running money thought I was a meal I don't know what they thought I was doing but as soon as that happened my mom had passed away from cancer and when she was dying I played like hospice I was her nurse and I realized no one could raise my daughter the way I that I could and my mom could and with her being gone I was over my backup plan some housing my mom got it was good as soon as she left I was like I can't do this no more and so I started cookies clothing and I put in 19 G's into cookies clothing and last year we hit 12 point eight million dollars Wow off merchandise and that's why I feel freely talking about it because I never looked back and people you can only imagine rappers and entourage and people what's up with the honey pack I need a box and are you late to the party brother I'm doing this wreck [ __ ] and there's big business on a table for it do you feel any uh like I guess survivor's guilt for all the guys that are in jail right now these unjust you know what I think this is I don't because there's a thing called equity program and what is for is for people that have been in trouble for weed to be able to get in the business and a lot of the big business people are using these people like Yelp let's say you got cut up Charla member give you a raccoon what let me use your name I'm put on this license we're doing something different at cookies we're getting a place in Oakland and we're gonna go find people that really got caught up we're gonna put them in a small grill container and teach them how to grow maybe introduce them to their own strain and educate them and put them in the game the right way so I feel like we're gonna give back genuinely while big businesses come in and trying to push our auto culture we're gonna really bring people in to teach them and let them know that you got a right to be in the business let's show you how to get into business we got the distribution the manufacturing the production we'll get the knowledge my breeders are creating new strains all the time so instead of just using people for equity program I'm gonna give back people you know man let's go equity what equity program I never heard of it yeah so a lot of people haven't because like I said big business is masking it so if you've been in trouble for weed in California there's a program that allows you to be and you actually have the first right to be in business so if you're from East Oakland are you from LA in order to get a license for a store or cultivation you have to have someone on equity program and of course big business says I was pay these guys off give him a couple thousand month use their name no big deal we're like man that's actually dope to be able to take someone that's been in trouble for cuz I risk my freedom for it and to be able actually put them in the game and and help and actually document this [ __ ] and really show people that yo people still care I think it's gonna be pretty interesting you still feel like a drug dealer hell yeah you know why because the legal weed game is shady bruh oh like you gotta think like I'm a Latin cattiness and I've been in it and I got deep roots and I got culture and I got product as pack speaks they don't want to see me in it do my thing and other groups try to push us out hard so I feel like it just because of the drama that comes with it de-stress like sometimes I'll wake up and have to deal with things that feels like I'm waiting on that box till you got butterflies in your stomach tripping off tissue it's crazy are you breast outside of LA right now outside of Cali yeah yeah yeah we're uh we're working on something out here on the East Coast we're definitely looking in the Florida just trying to be smart like how I own my music I could right now do a licensing deal and have a nationwide deal for storefronts we've already been offered you know close to 800 million dollars to buy cookies Wow but promote all Canadian stock okay all the Canadians are in the game right now they have these big public companies to offer you 800 million dollars in stock and maybe some of it will be cash or whatnot but the way I see it is like that need to move keep this in line build it wait so alcohol come so wait till someone comes that that will really cash out and and do it the right way and the beasts so you know instead of me spreading out through licensing deals I'm literally just one by one store buy yeah I'm just building it up get my money putting it back into it I want to own my [ __ ] y'all get out like it's a cookie cafes when we have the cookies campus in the bay so it's a it's a spot where we have distribution manufacturing production cultivation breeding and we're actually gonna start rolling up brands so brands that have the street buzz a Street hype that have something going but don't have the legal footprint don't have the platform and illegal we're gonna start rolling them up into campus and kind of learn from the bay you know Facebook that's how I'm looking at everyone's talking about the Apple of weed or the Starbucks that we that's that's not what it is well we want to do the Facebook of wheat we want to find a young talent put him in there get tissue cracking got you yeah project is out right now something new every day you got everyone Yona Kevin gates bone thugs-n-harmony young bulk of course Cam'ron Jim Jones everybody what's that for you musically man you know what uh me and we and Wiz have a album has been done for about a year about the prior couple years by the dropped out I got a project with a Kevin gates probably in the works to child to gates I'm gonna keep working Manish it is fun like I do this for fun I'm saying and people are really [ __ ] with it so I'm saying keep rocking that [ __ ] you know been able to sell ourselves nationwide every year we got the 420 show on eBay 8700 people know radio play no no major push so I think I'm just more of a to keep going really dope I appreciate you for joining us and thank you for holding me down every time I'm on the West I call burn up and burn to make sure I got a package of something waiting for me man if I come you know you got it to make sure you guys break that down I know the boys in the lobby wanted a little something to you all you got to do is I gotta do is pull up though

right guys we have here the Scott Shoji and holy moly this is some good stuff I happen to like it a lot I mean this is it just stinks so bad I can see there was a nice milky white stripes on there it makes me happy you open this and it's it's literally reeking through the jar like you open it up and it's like holy moly and I was saving this for a while um I wanted to you know happen to be I think I got one of the last packs from attitude so I was pretty happy about that as soon as they shipped it to me I looked I went on there to look you know exactly what the what they said the flowering time was and whatnot and it said sold out so maybe I got the last pack there but they have some now so you can get on there it's more nice they're only unregular I only happen to get four regulars and I've only sprouted to two were they were both female you're sweet camera Romney wants to be super close which is cool because I like that nice spot right there it's nice and milky hmm that little hair TV is little airy there the effect is just devastating um I really I'm liking this I harvested a little early I usually harvest when they're a little bit when they're milky to Amber and this was more clearer to Melky mostly milky some clear which this has just come through perfect perfect and stone really making it nice nice medicine I just want to have you guys see a nice close-up of this and how beautiful it is what she could smell like because it smells like a million dollars for sure alright everyone have a good day and stay medicated", "YfkAZLfCv1I": "[Music] hi this is julie with skunk TV and I'm here with Scott reach from where dank this so happy to have him here at the highway skunk magazine booth and Scott I wanted to talk to you today about your incredible philosophy in the industry it always inspires me when I talk with John I always tell him that Scott and Pamela are incredible examples let's watch them let's look at what they do let's follow their lead it's alright we still John I was just like Scott and Pamela there it where they're going is where we're going to and so tell people about how you and Pamela started and you guys transitioned in 2009-2010 and you started rare dank news and you started your own energy what were the commitments that helped you in Pamela create this you know for us it was really seeing the change that was happening within the u.s. medical marijuana was starting to be more accepted more States we're starting to look at their own medical laws for me you know I've been a breeder for almost 20 years now I've always wanted to see this plant legalized and really my devotion and my goals group are really focused around seeing this plant available for everyone you know all the time people thank us for what we do for the the patients and the industry and all that and it's very humbling but you know honestly everything that I do is for this plan for a long time she you know kept me away from booze and kept me away from prescription pills and stuff like that and like most people know I went through cancer in 2010 and at that point I garnered a really really strong relationship for it I actually got to experience the miraculous medicine that it is when you're going through something like that and it just strengthened my resolve to see this planet made available nowadays with so much benefits you're seeing four children with full plant extracts and all that you know every day I get up I go to work it's to see this plant you know respect it and appreciate it for what it is yeah we were just talking about that how in the cannabis industry a lot of times it becomes about money making and he go and who's on top and it's really it's not connected with the medicine of the plant and what the medicine is attempting to teach us about the sacredness of our relationships the symbiotic relationship between us and plants and also the sacredness of the relationships with you know our company how we do our business how we treat people we were talking about that earlier that you and Pamela have a really strong core to help people rise together within your community can you tell everybody a little bit about that some of the things that you're doing there in your new facility yeah I mean you know five years ago I put my five-year plan together I think out of everybody in this industry I probably crushed my five-year plan harder than you know anyone you know I've been very blessed to be able to win cannabis cups and to be able to breed and see my genetics all over the world you know I realized a few years ago that I was really meeting and exceeding a lot of the life goals that I had set for myself and then when we built this facility I really realized that I can do anything you know anything I set my mind anything that pamela and i set our goals to we can accomplish I mean we we've been together for twenty years we've been through rough times we get through great times and you know right now is all that hard work that we put in all those years you know we live in a throwaway society we decided a long time ago not to throw each other away and so now it's really focused on giving my employees and giving the people that we work with those same opportunities you know I want my employees to not just feel like workers I want them to understand that as we go forward and this becomes a more legitimate industry and we're able to expand into other states you know there's opportunities for them to run those facilities and be the directors of them and stuff like that you know you're spending the elevator back down you're making them healthy and as many people rise with you as possible very beautiful it should never once you've gotten to a point in your life where your daily stresses are coming up with new cool innovative innovative ideas you should be really focused on helping those people that are with you and then I've gotten you to that point so I try to explain to my guys all the time that you know it's never about putting people down it's always about lifting them up and it's our job to be humanitarians and professional and to have empathy and sympathy for everyone you know I think we lose that a lot I think the money sometimes becomes the focus and success becomes the focus for a lot of people and they don't understand that being successful doesn't have a monetary value on it it's really how you feel inside and how people feel towards you you know you know I have my I have my batch of haters but typically when they get to meet me and like sit down and actually talk to me and not just assume whatever they've assumed through a post that they've read or somebody else's opinion you know you can see that I'm a genuine dude and I you know I love this plant I love the community that surrounds this plant and ultimately it's going to be us that you know sees it going forward into the commercialized regulated market that it is and if we don't it's it's gone from our grasp yeah that's that's we were talking about to that with the highway so now skunk has launched and our new magazine the highway California and it's an exciting moment because the highway is devoted to just that it's about creating a platform of solidarity where we can all be together with the things that we can agree upon which is Agri centric which is craft culture which is small midsize businesses which is the sacredness of our relationships with each other with the earth with our resources and to show a lot of people evidence that a renaissance is happening that there is a returning to wisdom with our modern technologies for returning to ancient wisdoms or wisdoms that we knew at one time husbandry you know you know proper use of resources not overusing and so the highways all about that and you and Pamela are participating with us but you're very thankful thank you and for us you know to have the strength of what you guys are doing aligned with us I think that that is really what the pant the plant has been trying to teach us all along is hey you start to work together in a better way you have everything you need to be living a vibrant joyful life so I wanted to talk to you about that too and I'm encouraging you guys to actually start speaking in the magazine more about these ideas because you can't if you're just focused on the outward and you're not actually taking care of the inward and doing that work inside you're really not going to truly be happy or successful and ice noticed with you and fam you actually have a true feeling of joy and success and it's coming from within like you said yeah you know cannabis was a part of the tapestry of human culture for millennia for thousands and thousands of years early 1900 somebody in America plucked that threat out of the tapestry and it's kind of unraveled you know and it's a it's basically us reweaving and putting it back together and like you said learning some of that re learning some of that knowledge that we've lost over the last hundred years you know I I really have gotten to a point now that we have so many great employees within our facility everybody thinks for this giant company we're not I mean we're still a very small mom-and-pop business we're probably the 15th biggest facility in Colorado I mean there's 14 guys way bigger than us multiple shops everything we have one storefront you know what we're doing now is really trying to focus on taking the day-to-day mindless human type tasks that that human era can ultimately lead a more inferior product we've turned that over to the computer so that my employees can spend every day with the plants looking at the plants educating themselves to the strain to what that strain looks like under duress and what it looks like when it's grown to its perfection you know and it's it's freed me up now to the point that you know my day to day is I come in and I check to make sure everybody's good with their job and what they're doing with you know for their daily tasks or their week and then I'm starting to like re educate myself on growing again so like I'll spend three or four days in the clone room working with the clone guys and then I'll spend you know a few days in veg and I'll spend a few days with the packaging guys and I'll spend a few days in the flower rooms and that's man it's and it's it's giving me that passion again where I was getting like you said you're getting kind of burned out and very disgusted with the money-hungry and the shark type you know attitude we don't want to crush yes exactly so it's it's really been able to like allow me to inspire my people every day instead of going in and micromanagement yeah you get to relax after all of these years of incredible effort and hard work you're saying that you got to delegate out things that maybe you don't enjoy doing as much and you can get back to what is your joy but you know that help people specialize help them get deeper in to the science and and the understanding which is that exactly I try to I try to get everyone to go deeper than just doing their job don't don't do your tasks just to do it understand the repercussions that happen if you don't do it early or if you do it too late or whatever like I understand what happens within the not only the plant but within the facility and within the social structure of just working with people like just do your job and be happy doing your job and you're launching your store now announced for everyone when your stores launching and and now you're gonna really be able to tell the story of your brand even more and really bring this out there and really let people know who you guys are and well I'll probably get killed by Pamela if I announce a day but we're hoping we're really hoping that it's going to be December 16th as the opening it might get pushed back a day or so it's really not up to us we have we have we have one final sign-off that has to happen from the city through your inspections yeah no jinxing yeah but yeah yeah so if we're gonna have it open hopefully by Christmas and it'll be open seven days a week I think will be closed you know Christmas Day and Thanksgiving and stuff like that but we're gonna it's a beautiful storm and it is it's Pamela's baby it's her design it was what she had envisioned in her head and when she sat down with the architects and they designed it out it I mean it looks like a high-end watch store you could sell high-end handbags or you know anything it's and it and it does represent our brand really well I mean Earl is you know he's all over that place my son is asking me for a good yeah everybody loves her all the scones I just had an idea we should let him be on the cover with Sparky skunk one day yeah that would be a good cover right pledge it's such a pleasure always always always to speak with you you make me feel better about being in the world and being in this industry no joke you really keep us inspired so thank you very much and major success for Christmas we're gonna cover it in the next issue let's get some pictures of opening and let's cover it in the next issue thank you so much I appreciate it and thank you guys coming back soon"}
