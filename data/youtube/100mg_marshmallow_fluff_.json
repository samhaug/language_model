{"mmSEYff-ut4": "all right I have said on this channel many times sometimes I do videos for me and I hope that they resonate with you for years I've wanted to put the marshmallow fluff up against the jet Puft Marshmallow and today we're gonna do it so cue the intro what is up everyone it is the endorsement and it is time for another review this is where I try something and tell you if you shall like it or not I can be very persuasive so yes marshmallow fluff up against craft jet puffed famous for the marshmallows famous for fluffer nutters I mean I gotta just drop the mic so yeah I think I tried this one time 15 years ago maybe something like that and I was like whoa there's nothing that can replace fluff I think early on on my channel I reviewed marshmallow fluff where I didn't even say a word maybe I'll link that below but I'm talking like four years ago I think I made that video so this sparked my interest doing this review this video reverses marshmallow fluff vs. jet puff when I met Kathy from two-cent chicks and I'm pretty sure she said she has only had jet puffed in her life and didn't even know anything about marshmallow fluff well she knew about it hopefully fluffernutter even says right here where is it fluff another it's an iconic iconic product so let's open it up I did look at the ingredients they're very similar except jet puffed contains some type of chemical also contains water does not contain vanillin this contains some type of vanilla so there is a clear top right there whoa yeah that's right up to the top thank you very much for that fluff that has a white top so let's break it open here I'm very intrigued I love marshmallow fluff whoa I can already tell the consistency of the jet puffed a little bit different so yeah let's get the rest of it debris off of it and have you take a look at the inside of the jet puffed alright put that off to the side again here is the fluffed they don't have a little tab they don't need a tab whoa check it out we have some pitch so there is the fluff looking a little more whipped I might say sorry let's go I have two spoons we're not making a fluffernutter I would not do that to peanut butter or the name of fluff another where do I dare make a fluff another with jet puffs so we're just going in with a chick-fil-a spoon into the jet puffed wish me luck so I'm gonna have you take a look at it yeah it's like oh yeah knowing it has water in it it definitely is a little more liquidy if that is even a word so nice spoonful right there wish me luck jet Puft Marshmallow cream here we go yeah I've already nailed this I know what that tastes like I'm gonna taste it in a minute this is more watery definitely more watery and it has that flavor which isn't a bad thing of marshmallow 100% they're marshmallow because jet puffed they do marshmallow right so I'm not taking anything away from them there but when it comes to the marshmallow creme creme a creme na let me go in for another bite just to make sure check it out you see a little like kind of liquidy looking but yes so does it hit the taste buds it was definitely different than the fluffy marshmallow all right marshmallow we got a new chick-fil-a spoon no sponsorship now for the marshmallow fluff have you take a look even putting the spoon in there's resistance there's more resistance than in the jet puffed yeah look at that look at it oh and the pull I'm so excited I will eat an entire container of this over like a month just spooning it out making a couple fluffer nutters here and there but I will just have a spoonful of two of this I love it so up close check it out right there air pockets wish me luck Oh there is no comparison yep there is a big comparison you know what I'm talking about these things are similar by name similar marshmallow but other than that no now what I will say after eating these back-to-back which I've never done before but this vanillin VA ni llin is vanilla that flavor to me puts it over the top so it still tastes like marshmallow like a marshmallow but it gives it that little something extra that little bit of sweetness that little bit more that I love and I've always loved ever since I was a kid so I'm gonna go in for another bite but the thickness is definitely different and I like the fact that it does not have any water in this where that did seem to be a little more watered down which is why I'm getting more of a thickness on the marshmallow fluff so another bite no brainer alright so they both are good but hands down I'm gonna say that marshmallow fluff is the winner I went into this trying not to have any preconceived notions I know that I boycotted this you know probably 15 years ago it's not bad but going head to head with both of these yeah you can definitely tell the difference and this will always be number one and jet puffed unfortunately sorry Jeff puff is not going to grace the cabinets anytime soon so there you go another video in the books please like comment share and subscribe also please do not forget to check me out on Instagram and Twitter that is social media getting the word of my channel out to the masses in closing let me know hit up the comments jet puffed or fluffer nutter know marshmallow fluff but yeah no fat or cholesterol gluten free not seeing that on the jet puffed another little added bonus it may be I just do not see it so yeah there you go a very in-depth side-by-side comparison of marshmallow fluff and jet puffs the winner all right bonus footage I had an Oreo left over I just filmed an Oreo cookie review and I had two of the Oreo shells available so I made a fluff Oreo I better get to this because it is protruding out of the sides here we go I might need a minute [Music]", "kqFMquRAml0": "this is the problem with our freeze dryer is I keep finding junk food that I didn't like initially that now I just really regular ice cream in today's video we are trying out a few more requests from you with our freeze dryer what different types of desserts can we freeze dry and what will happen to them [Music] not too long ago we had a video where we freeze-dried several types of candy like this gummy worm or what used to be a gummy worm and turned it into styrofoam of sorts sugary styrofoam it's delicious but very very lightweight odd very odd but very good and that video a lot of you had requests of things you wanted to see us freeze-dried because I think we said what do you want to see us freeze-dried yeah what is fair so thank you for chiming in here's the basic idea we have several different types of desserts some that you are requested to see some that are downright strange and some that we want to try ourselves what happens if we throw these in our freezer iron let's see what do we got we've got some cheesecake of assorted flavors and that's one that was suggested to us by somebody in the freeze-drying company this is a lemon meringue pie I'm curious to see what happens both to lemon curd and to the meringue when we freeze dry it right now we've got kind of a squishy spongy meringue texture I'm guessing that's going to dry into something that's a lot of crunch here it's a mousse yeah I was talking about this one cuz it's light and fluffy but it's still technically classified as sort of a liquid cake cake listen frosting on it yep just again want to see what happens it's a bread product I have recently been experimenting with different types of bread products you might see that very soon and I want to know what cake does not familiar with it marshmallow fluff this one sounded like a glorious idea to me we've also recently tried freeze drying marshmallows but not marshmallow fluff this stuff is light and airy and spreadable and delicious you got gushers yep I thought I banned gushers from the studio I got him anyway you can keep that this is our cup of leftover gusher juice we extracted the juice from 10 pounds of gushers and high cheese what's fantastic choice these are just ones you just grabbed yeah I like it and then something that you guys also requested and I am very curious about is scoops of ice cream in our previous snack video when we tried candies we tried freeze drying ice cream bars fat boy ice cream sandwiches because we heard they would be good they were fantastic I just want to try some scoops of ice cream but something else I want to try is gelato so we've got this brand of ice cream this is one of my favorite brands of ice cream it's very very creamy rich and creamy it's more expensive but it is really good then we got to compare we have some Walmart brand ice cream which I suspect is not as good and then we do have some American gelato oh yeah we're gonna try all three varieties of our frozen dairy desserts so I think with the pie and the cheesecakes and the cake we should yeah go for thin slices not more than half an inch thick to give it the best chance of drying all the way through maybe it come in big lumps just to see but and then we've got some parchment paper if we have anything that we think might stick too much to the tray we can put it on that I'm just so curious about the honeycomb so I'm gonna try and get that little brick out of there while you think that's nuts pie and cake cool well this is beeswax it is an edible wax but there are warnings usually that you don't want to consume too much these wacky can cause stomach blockages yeah it's wax but some people will lead it in minor quantities and some people like it in there honey so I'm gonna try this out it is quite interesting I've never actually tried beeswax itself so like the honeycomb so I'm actually gonna take a little piece off here because I would like to know I would assume it tastes like honey and wax [Music] they both taste and feels like I bit into a beeswax candle because I technically did put that out now we've got these three trays in the ice cream tray I think we can carry it up and load a new machine all right come back in 24 hours see what's happened it's the next day let's pull stuff out of the machine guys we've got a delightful assortment of desserts or pair of vastly changed texture so some things that I'm really surprised about anytime we put a sugary drink or juice in the freezer it blows up but our gusher juice we've got phone from stuff like this before yes you remember like cotton candy we dissolve fun candy or water that was just a foam but our gushers juice now we are gonna wait until it warms up cuz right now it might just be frozen cuz these are very very cold yes well let things warm up a little bit and try them then as well that that doesn't seem like it's just frozen that seems like it has turned crunchy let's find out [Music] we made Jolly Ranchers it does warm up and get a little bit chewy yeah I'm worried we're gonna pull my teeth out that is a very different consistency even warmed up it's like a hard to eat candy yep it's not gushers do you know we had before all right we wanted to try this because ice cream sandwiches are so flippin good and we had our expensive nicer ice cream we had our cheap Walmart ice cream and then we had our gelato so with the gelato weird-looking this what the heck happened now in the past any time we put something in the freezer Irish caramel in it like Milky Way the caramel bubbles up so I'm thinking because this was a caramel cookie crunch gelato maybe that's just the caramel a face not colored that we might just be the caramel I don't know it just tastes like nope mm-hmm I really like it that is just like a cookie yeah it tastes like ice cream mm-hmm like a crispy crunchy cookie texture oh my goodness you could sell ice cream bites like this I'm going to eat these forever so this is the cheap brand ice cream I really like that that's good it's just like astronaut ice cream talking at the inside it has all fluffed up quite evenly equally it's kind of like what the ice cream sandwiches did I think yes but the ice cream sandwiches they never even fully froze like they got kind of gooey yeah now is that thick yes that's why these ones we have these inner bubbles but they did solidify yeah so I'd actually take the Walmart brand over V Tillamook in this instance these are know why I choose now they're high crunch I think that sounds like a crunch there's two layers uh-huh crunchy all the way through but look at that yeah the outside expanded but I don't think the inside did nearly as much I lied dangit I like that more - I like skittles more I like ice cream more I like high trees we have to stop freeze drying stuff guys it is a problem that sounds awesome let's get fat so this is marshmallow fluff yep it wasn't quite this fluffy before okay that's fantastic for a different experiment we have freeze-dried some regular marshmallows and you know they get crunchy mmm they're the same texture as Lucky Charms marshmallows but they didn't actually change very much size-wise they don't change it all like these little ones crackled a little bit but the size and shape stayed pretty much the same the marshmallow fluff did not it expanded wildly okay remember when you were in Italy and you told me that you tried like a giant chunk of meringue and it wasn't as good as you were expecting it to be this is how I would expect a good meringue to be like what it reminds me I was in Venice and they were selling like these pieces of meringue this size and the kind that you cook until it's like solid and crunchy all the way through I got like two bites into it after I bought it and it was just like I don't really want this anymore it was denser than I thought but this is like so light and fluffy and like actually has a fairly mild flavor it reminds me honestly of when we freeze-dried cotton candy because it dissolves in your mouth so quick very very quickly and yeah this is a much less intense flavor than actual marshmallows so our honey did what our honey always does it exploded and then it froze but even though it seems crunchy now guys what always happens with our honey is it'll be crunchy but as soon as it hits your tongue it's gonna go back to being kind of squishy it's only crunchy for about half a second it's like honey yeah so our marshmallow fluff it's reminding me of cotton candy want to see if it dissolves the same way every time we freeze-dried cotton candy up Laffy Taffy it dissolves so fast in water so let me see how fast this results first it floats pretty great like a bath mom uh-huh kind of floats better than a bath bomb in fact but it is just disintegrating so actually yes exactly like a bath bomb that's even dissolving in my fingers gushers now they're crunchers so instead of hai choose we have hai crunch and instead of gushers we have crunchers [Music] [Applause] don't kind of chewy like a chewy hard like a cold starburst chewy hard I don't like them no we got rid of everything that's good about gushers I don't like it so yeah out of all this I'm gonna say I like everything so far except for the honey in the gushers those just don't get a pass for me all right next up we've got like our dessert tray yeah rather than candy we have desserts so we've got chocolate cake chocolate mousse cat several varieties of cheesecake and lemon meringue pie I'm very excited to see what this meringue is like I'm so curious oh the meringue is very easy to cut the lemon curd not as much [Applause] [Music] instead of being soft meringue it's crunchy meringue yeah with I'm gonna lemon curd very very little flavor in that the texture is very very similar to that marshmallow fluff now it is real comparison test that's way better it's not even particularly good pie but it's better than the freeze-dried time cheesecake okay crunchy this is like a cookie mm-hmm cheesecake cookie even like a harder cookie than the ice cream was but very cookie textured knees and cheesecake flavor okay so here's the problem I don't care for cookies so for me this is another one of those situations where I would rather have a slice of cheesecake but yeah the flavor is still fantastic chocolate mousse okay and it was just one was the top so it had the console it's exactly the same just top hunger topic okay so many things that are freeze-dried to have a similar texture and that really is I think the most accessible way to say it is like the marshmallows and Lucky Charms are these dried and so it's that usually about that consistency this is a little smoother creamier which makes sense yeah this was mousse mm-hmm it's good yes by a bit yep for traveling anything like that absolutely phenomenal again with the whole I'm not a huge rocket fan but that's still very good any of you were a chocolate fan you would go crazy over that it's very thick or were you were saying about something else as like an ice cream topping yes doesn't that crumble doc good cake or even like mixed into ice cream cakes chocolate it looks identical it feels like a cookie this one feels like I would pick up like cut in half cookie I don't know if it's just because I was eating the chocolate mousse which is really strong but I'm not gonna make any chocolate flavor I chose lots of interesting textures some for the better some for the worse look at you gushers but overall this has been a lot of fun different types of ice cream different types of candy guys were willing to do other stuff so if you have any new ideas things that we haven't already tried make sure you've seen what we've done before before suggesting the same stuff because we want new ideas and if we get enough flow if we can do another one guys that's not all you know we've always got more to see hit that box up at the top for our most recent video and we'll see in the next one sake then [Applause] [Music]", "dFjv8-W14-g": "[Music] greetings my beautiful lovelies its Emmie welcome back summer is fast approaching and that to me means burgers so I'm planning on doing a series of regional burgers I didn't know that regional burgers that were so specific and unusual existed until I watched a couple episodes of the burger show by first we feast amazing series a couple episodes I watch out on the hosts cooks and eats burgers with George Motz the author of this book the great American burger book which I got out of my local library now George has become my expert when it comes to burger nests because he goes into such scientific kind of specificity in history when it comes to these burgers absolutely amazing to learn about the local history through the lens of a burger love that burgers are humble burgers are accessible burgers are democratic another reason to love this meat patty on a bun so let me show you some examples so this sounds amazing the fried onion burger from Oklahoma George actually demonstrates how to cook this with Alvin and one of the episodes again I'll put the link to that video down below sounds incredible as a huge fan of the smash burger in fact that's probably my favorite style of burger this sounds absolutely amazing this is the nut burger as a guy who lived in Montana for a little while I have a special love for Montana and I never had this this is it from Butte it involves taking peanuts that you crushed and you just mix it with a little bit of Miracle Whip then you slather your burger with a big pile of this stuff yes now I regularly put peanut butter on my burger so I don't see what there's not to love in this burger this comes from Nebraska and Kansas there's lots of permutations called the Runza also called the coal ash and the B Rock this one sounds amazing look at that that looks like a bow but inside you've got a burger yes yes another one from the Minnesota area I want to make is the Juicy Lucy it is called such because it contains cheese when you bite into it the Juicy Lucy happens the stuffed burger this is something that you might see in this Instagram kind of gimmick world but no this has some history the Juicy Lucy has been around since 1953 I believe historic so I'll be making that one as well now today's burger is not actually included in this cookbook I actually couldn't find that much information about it and it is called the fluff screamer or the fluff burger so this recipe comes from eastern Pennsylvania from Schuylkill County from Gerard's ville Pennsylvania and a tiny little place called Toni's lunch and they are known for a particular style of cheeseburger called a screamer now the screamer is called a screamer because it has a meat sauce which they call hot sauce which is quite hot so the legend goes that a young lady went to Tony's lunch and requested marshmallow fluff on her burger for the longest time it never happened and finally someone rescinded actually put a scoop of this on there she always had it other people started ordering it and that was the birth of the fluff burger or the fluff screamer now marshmallow fluff I love this container is iconic it actually hails from this area of New England in Massachusetts and it is basically what it sounds like it is a spreadable fluffy marshmallow spread the fluffernutter sandwich is very popular around here which is a sandwich made of peanut butter and marshmallow fluff you can imagine children would love that combination but today I'm gonna be smacking this on a burger now I love the combination of sweet and salty so I think this will be an interesting combination I'm not sure texturally how it's going to be so that's why I'm gonna make it let's make ourselves a fluff screamer another reason why I'm referencing George's book is that I'm gonna be using his recipe for bean list beef chili sauce now I didn't realize this but this was a way for burger dives to use up leftover meat as you imagine you're making burgers and then you've got a lot of ground beef left over so a meat sauce was invented right you just used your leftover ground beef mixed it with a few ingredients add some water and now you have something that you can refrigerate and extend and just place on your burger so nothing goes to waste now I didn't find any specific references or recipes for Tony's lunches style of a hot sauce I just watched a few videos and I saw that it had a noticeably amount of red chili flakes in it and based on what I've read in forums people said it was quite hot so let me show you what I did to make the hot sauce so he just saw span up with some vegetable oil and add half a minced up yellow onion stir that around for a few minutes until it's nice and translucent then add one large clove of garlic minced saute that around don't let anything burn and then add a 1/2 pound of ground beef now we're going to stir this and mush it all around till the beef is nice and crumbly so reduce the heat a little bit I'm gonna add a pinch of salt and then add about a teaspoon of brown sugar about a teaspoon of chili powder a little pinch of cumin seed and a couple shakes of Worcestershire sauce stir this around and then we're going to add one teaspoon of tomato paste and about a half a cup of crushed canned tomato and then add a half a cup of water bring this up to a boil and then reduce the heat down to a simmer and let it cook up for about 15 minutes so what I notice in a couple of videos of Toni's lunch is that the sauce is quite soupy so don't hesitate to add a little bit of water to make this more of like a saucy consistency okay so now that we have our hot sauce ready let's go ahead and prepare our Burger I love my skillet but I'm going to use my griddle pan so you can see a little bit better it's also easier to flip your burger when you don't have the sidewalls of the skillet but it does make a mess but you know burners just make a mess anyways I also and George also recommends in his book a nice sturdy spatula I actually found this at a thrift store new years ago I love this thing this is the probably one of the most used tools in my kitchen love this spatula very sturdy strong short handle really really great for scraping all that yummy Fond off and then flipping so we're gonna get this screaming hot I'm using 80/20 ground beef here based on what I've saw in a few videos the patty is at Tony's lunch seem to be a bit thicker they do look hand formed they're definitely not a smash burger this apparently makes the most amazing instant fudge to which I've never tried so if you guys want to see that video let me know down the comments this is starting to smoke so I'm gonna put my patty down there we go just a light little push and we're just gonna let that go we're gonna make sure all our windows are open and let our smoke detectors are for naught so what we're looking for is a really good crusty sear on this so resist the urge to remove this or mess around with it let it do its thing and once we start seeing some kind of blood juicy stuff come up then we can consider giving it a flip so okay so who the cloud of Burger Smith look you can begin to see some of these juices being and zooted use your spatula and scrape really hard down you want to get all of that crispness flick yes that is what I'm talking about we want all that beautiful crispy yummy yummy yummy yummy mess okay so we're gonna let this go a few more minutes and get that other side nice and lovely I'm gonna smell really myself oh so now that's been a couple minutes on this side I'm gonna just cover that a little bit and give it an extra little steam just to cook it up a little bit more because what I saw in again the videos that I saw this program looks pretty well done in the middle hamburger bun nothing fancy here I love how it gives you a little warning here it says occasional lids doming is normal refrigeration is not necessary okay so here is that oh yeah look at that let's grab our burger place it right on the oh I'm gonna take our slice of white American cheese we're gonna do this quick cheese style meaning we're not going to melt this fold in half put it right on top to the top of the bun we're gonna add some butter from what I could tell it looked like margarine very very spreadable and just kind of in this kind of a tub format so I'm gonna do that now we're gonna add our hot sauce onions I love it burger with onions now for the fun part a huge dollop of marshmallow fluff huge like how do you get it off the spoon it's what I want to know Wow take drifts like marshmallows right on there holy smoke locusts now we just put a lid on it here we go that's amazing oh my gosh alrighty and here it is the fluff screamer or the fluff burger and already it looks like a hot mess so over at Tony's lunch they serve this on the little paper plate style do that eat the ducky balls mmm I think I like that might have to try it again mmm don't you say that that's a very nicely cooked burger although I like my steak where I don't like my burgers to be to where there's just a little bit of pink in there just how I like them you've got the soft hamburger bun you got the equally soft fluffy boozy marshmallow fluff that's sweet and sticky and then you've got the salty cheese and the hot spicy meat sauce in there all together it works really well and then you've got that burger that has a little bit of crispy crustiness on the outside and it's a great combination but I definitely would recommend putting some onions on there not only for that nice textural contrast but also for that flavor that combination of meat and onion classic absolutely classic can we just give it up to kids and they're willing to experiment love that something happens as we get older we lose that zest for experimentation I feel like kids will do anything they're going to put their tuna fish sandwich in their kool-aid they're going to take marshmallow fluff and put it on their burger kids are awesome awesome love you kids love you kids we are all kids at heart we should remember that already back to eating burgers so there you have it the fluff screamer I definitely recommend at least trying it the next time I find myself in eastern Pennsylvania I'm going to definitely try it in the context that is Tony's the lunch although I've heard it has strange hours even though it's called Tony's lunch it's not open for lunch it doesn't even open until about 6 o'clock because I think they'd go after the bar late night crowd so yeah I have to make a special point to get there around dinnertime so there you have it my first episode of regional burgers let me know down in the comments below if there's a specific burger you'd like to see or if there's one from your area or if there's a burger chain or a burger joint that you recommend I'm all ears because like I said I love

"gRimWDiesNw": "Hi, I'm Ashlee Marie, and today we're making one of my favorites two different ways, marshmallow frosting, marshmallow cream, marshmallow fluff, whatever it's called. It's delicious. if you love marshmallows don't forget to like this video and don't forget to subscribe so you don't miss some of the amazing summer recipes I have coming up. Let's get started. So my marshmallow frosting and my marshmallow cream are actually the same overall ingredients but just done in different ways. In fact, both of them are meringues. One is more Swiss based and one is more Italian based. Whether you heat the egg whites and the sugar together or you heat the sugar and pour it into the egg whites, the results is the same. It is going to stabilize and hold on to the egg whites creating this wonderful frosting that is not going to melt. Just like when I stabilize my whip cream and I use gelatin. We're going to start with what I call marshmallow frosting. Now this is an easier technique to make. It has slightly less ingredients and the result is wonderful. This is also known as a seven-minute frosting or an American meringue. I use this on top of my tarts. I use this in my ice cream. I use this on top of ice cream. We're going to add all the ingredients except for the vanilla into a large, because this gets fluffy, a large mixing bowl over a saucepan of water. So egg whites, sugar, and corn syrup. Always use a metal bowl. A glass bowl will work but metal bowls are better with egg white. In fact copper is the very best but it's expensive. I am totally saving up for a copper bowl. There is something in the way the egg whites react to the copper and it just... you end up with a much lighter and fluffier egg white. So, I've started heating my water. Now we want to start mixing  this right away even though it's not hot yet. Because if I wait until the water is boiling, it's actually going to cook those egg whites and we don't want scrambled egg whites, we want to make frosting. So, I'm going to start beating it now. I'm going to keep beating it as it heats up and keep beating it and keep beating it and keep beating it until soft peaks form. Then we're going to take it off the heat. That should take about four to five minutes. We are now at soft peaks and it's time to pull it off the heat. We will take this mixture and put it into a room temperature bowl, or, I don't like getting two bowls dirty, so I just put it in a larger bowl filled with ice to help cool it down quickly. Now we're going to add our vanilla and keep beating until we get stiff peaks. And we have stiff peaks. Look how pretty. Totally stiff. We are ready. Alright, now for our second recipe. I call this one marshmallow cream. It's a little bit of a trickier technique but the results are stunning. Alright, so, because this is meringue based, you want to make sure you're using a metal or glass bowl. Metal would be preferred. Glass is second place, but you do not want to use plastic. Plastic holds on to the grease, no matter how much you clean it, and it will actually destroy meringue and meringue will just never come together properly. So, trust me, metal bowl. So first up we're going to whip our egg white. Now you can add a little bit of cream of tartar, that is optional. And then I have a little bit of sugar and we're going to add this sugar once it is foamy as it's mixing. And you want to beat that until soft peaks form. Now while we're whipping those egg whites into soft peaks we're going to make the sugar syrup, add some water and some sugar, and some corn syrup. Now we want to heat that up until it hits 242 degrees Fahrenheit and that is just above the soft ball stage And remember, depending on where you live, you might have to adjust the temperatures. 242 degrees Fahrenheit is a sea level temperature. Make sure that you test your candy thermometer and see what adjustments you need to make. Alright, we are up to temperature. Now it's time to pour our hot sugar into our egg whites. Now if we just pour it straight in here, these whisks that it's going to hit are going to fling hot syrup everywhere, and, I don't know about you, but I don't like burning hot sugar being thrown at me. So, what you want to do is pour it over here where the beaters start bending down and in between the side of the bowl and where the beaters bend down, and that's going to be the magic spot that we want to hit with this thin stream. So turn it on and pour it while it's mixing.  Now I'm going to put the lid on and turn it up on high. Alright. Check that out. How thick and luscious does that look. I just want to take a big bite! So that's it, we're all finished. Marshmallow frosting and marshmallow cream. They're both white, fluffy, light, delicious. They're both glossy and smooth and, hmm. They really smell good. I will say the difference between the two. The marshmallow cream I think ends up being slightly more stable, but that's kind of it. So depending on what you're using it for, I use them pretty interchangeably depending on the recipe, kind of depending on how many egg whites they have, or how much time I have. You can pipe them both, you can frost with them both. You can use both of them as toppings, as fillings. Whichever one you use, just make sure that you use it right away and that you use it quickly. It's at its thickest right after you're finished beating it. If you're using it as just a topping or as a marshmallow fluff, you can put it in an airtight container in the fridge and it will last for a couple of days before it starts to separate, but it will get droopy as it sits there. It won't ever be as firm. I use both of these all the time. I will include links down below so that you can check out some of the other recipes that I use these for, and let's see. Hmm. Seriously, they're both amazing. If you try either one of them, let me know in the comments down below. I'd love to hear what you think. Thanks for watching.", "aDrQidR5h6g": "hi there my lovely is but those of you who have never had marshmallow fluff before you are missing out it's basically spreadable marshmallows or if you were to imagine what melted marshmallows would be like this would be it the first time ever had it was on a peanut butter and marshmallow fluff sandwich and it was heavenly it also goes great on cupcakes so let me show you how easy it is to make it in some ice cold water I'm going to add in the gelatin mix them together and set it aside for 10 minutes to firm up in a large saucepan I'm going to mix together the sugar water and a pinch of salt over medium heat I'm going to bring my mixture up to a light boil you have a candy thermometer you want to bring it up to 240 degrees Fahrenheit if you don't have a thermometer that's not a problem just boil it for about seven minutes my gelatin mixture is sat for ten minutes I'm going to add that to the bowl of my stand mixer my sugar mixture is ready so I'm going to add the hot liquid directly to the bowl now I'm going to whisk my mixture on medium high speed for about 10 to 12 minutes or until it's reach medium Peaks halfway through the whiskey I'm just going to add a little bit of vanilla extract once it's finish I'm going to add it to a glass mason jar and store it in the refrigerator and that's it I hope you give this video try especially if you've never had it before also make sure to check out my homemade marshmallows video for more fluffy goodness and don't forget to subscribe bye my lovelies", "UETeIDkTRhM": "Hi Bold Bakers! When I came to America for the very first\ntime on holidays, I tasted marshmallow fluff. And I just thought that American kids were\nso lucky that they get to buy this stuff in stores because we couldn\u2019t get it in Ireland. But I\u2019m going to show you how you can make\nit yourself, really easily at home so no matter where you are in the world, you can have marshmallow\nfluff too. Let\u2019s get started. We\u2019re going to start out in a heavy bottom\nsaucepan on the stove. Into the pot, add in your water, sugar, and\ncorn syrup. Over a low heat, we just want this mixture\nto dissolve and melt. You do not want it to simmer it at this stage. All the ingredients I use in this recipe are\nreally important and if you can\u2019t find some of them, I\u2019m going to put a link on my website\nof how you can buy them directly online. Okay, so it doesn\u2019t take much time, but\nas you can see my sugar has dissolved and everything has melted. So at this stage, we turn up our heat to start\nto have a controlled simmer. We remove our spatula; you do not add in a\nspatula or a wooden spoon after this point. Then to the side of our pot, we\u2019re going\nto add on our candy thermometer. And we need this because it\u2019s going to tell\nus what stage we\u2019re going to turn it off at. Always when you are working with a mix like\nthis, whether its caramel, marshmallows, or marshmallow fluff, you want to have a controlled\nheat. So a light bubble, never boiling, just steady\nas you go. The reason you don\u2019t put a wooden spoon\nor spatula in there once it starts to simmer is it can actually crack your mix and it will\nbe totally ruined; it will have to go in the bin. We\u2019re letting this mix simmer until it reaches\naround 240 degrees Fahrenheit, or 120 degrees Celsius, which is soft ball stage. Okay great, so we\u2019ve reached our temperature. It does a few minutes. And what you want to do is knock off the heat\nand then just move it over and really quickly, we\u2019re going to whip up our egg whites. So to whip up our egg whites, I\u2019m going\nto use my stand mixer but you can always use an electric hand mixer. So have the egg whites at room temperatures\nbecause it makes them whip up so much better. So pour them in there, into your clean bowl. Into our egg whites, we are going to add in\nsome cream of tartar and this is an important ingredient, you can\u2019t leave it out because\nit does make a difference to the texture of our marshmallow fluff. So we\u2019re going to turn on our machine medium\nhigh speed and whip up our egg whites until they reach a soft peaks, around three or four\nminutes. When making your marshmallow fluff, have all\nof your ingredients out, ready to go so when you turn off your sugar, you can start your\negg whites straight away so you can keep the process going nice and quickly. Perfect. Our egg whites have formed soft peaks so what\nI\u2019m going to do is turn the machine down onto a lower speed and very carefully and\nslowly drizzle in our sugar mix. Please be very careful when you\u2019re doing\nthis step. And if you need so, ask an adult or somebody\nto help you. Once all of your sugar is in there, I\u2019m\ngoing to turn the machine back up to medium high speed and just let it beat by itself\nfor around seven to eight minutes or until you see the mixture become nice and thick\nand glossy. At this time, you\u2019ll start to see your mixture\nget a lot thicker and start to bloom up a little bit. So we\u2019re going for kind of a drier marshmallow\nand you\u2019ll se that happen as it whips. Okay, this is perfect. Our marshmallow is lovely and fluffy. The last thing I want to add into it is a\nlittle bit of vanilla extract. And then just give it another whip up really\nfast to incorporate the vanilla. And there you have it: homemade marshmallow\nfluff. Who even knew that was possible? This is the texture that you want; do you\nsee how it\u2019s gotten nice and thick like the inside of a marshmallow. And let\u2019s face it: the fluff is the best\npart. I\u2019ve got fantastic recipes that include\nthis marshmallow fluff and also lots more Bold Baking Basics videos just like this one\non my website so make sure you go and check them out.", "XJYB3cLv_lU": "Hello and welcome to Todd's kitchen. I have had so many requests for this over the last few months I just couldn't resist any\nlonger it is very simple to make and i know you will love it. So join me today as i make my version of\nmarshmallow fluff. To start of with into a mixing bowl we are going to place in and and a half egg whites. Now the ingredients are listed in the description add to that one Cup of corn syrup What i have done is heat it up in the microwave for thirty seconds It just makes it allot easier to pour then to that  add in a pinch of salt. Now using a hand mixer or a stand mixer we are going to beat this up for about five minutes until it comes up nice and fluffy and doubles in volume As you can see it is now nice and white and fluffy and double in size So to that add in one cup of\nconfectioners sugar or icing sugar Pre sifted of course. Then mix it in until its well combined. So once thats mixed through add in one tablespoon of vanilla\nextract and that's it. You can use it straight away if you like other wise pour it into a sealed container and it will last in the fridge for up\nto two weeks So there we have it very simple, very easy marshmallow fluff. But lets see what its like. mmm oh thats spot on. That tastes exactly like marshmallows only difference is its in a liquid form instead of a solid. So it was super easy to make and very cheap but the main thing about this marshmallow fluff is it tastes simply delicious So for those recipes you want to use marshmallow fluff in or if you want to have some by its self   this is the perfect recipe.

video to learn how to throw out that trash you have in your house which is the pre packaged hot cocoa and this time to make boozy super fancy homemade hot cocoa you don't wanna just do that we're also making homemade marshmallow fluff you can totally skip this part but you definitely should give it a try X is not only a lot of fun to do but it's also insanely delicious right into our stand mixer I'm gonna add in some cold water and then to that I'm also gonna add in some fish gelatin which is going to start to bloom alright to have a nice medium high flame on here into this pot I'm going to add in our sugar and a little bit of water and now it's very important that you're very careful at this step to make sure that you do this correctly so your sugar does not crystallize because that is the last thing you want okay so now while all the sugar is melting it is very important that does not crystallize so we're gonna want to do is take a pastry brush in some water and just brush down the sides occasionally which will get rid of any of that sugar over there that will get crystallized which is the enemy of what we're doing alright let's check the temperature alright we are almost at the softball stage we are very close and what that means is just a stage where if you take the sugar out and pour it into some ice cold water the texture of the sugar will be like a soft malleable little ball all right how much sugar it is now already I'm going to start a mixer on high I'm gonna let this beat slowly pour it in for about 12 minutes okey so as you can see it is almost done so I'm going to add in a little bit of vanilla extract for some flavor and just a little bit of salt okay there we go that looks nice and thick now it's been nice and whipped up so let me just take this spoon and let me show you what is going on look at that how is seemly just like delicious and thick and like whipped up that is I mean I gotta give a try before we can do this Omar okay so let's do the hot cocoa what we're gonna do from our cocoa is we're not taking a powder pour it into hot water where you are fancier than that we're gonna take right over here some whole milk and a little bit of heavy cream because we want a super thick hot cocoa I like my how coke could be really thick because I think it's kind of more like almost like in-between like a hot cocoa like drink and almost like it's thick that's like a soup okay so our milk is about to come to blows I'm going to lower the flame and to that I'm going to add in some chocolate chips now I like to use anything from a semi-sweet chocolate chip to a milk chocolate chip it really depends your preference and how sweet you want it right I'm using milk chocolate chips because that's what I'm in the mood for but really any type of chocolate well-worth you just want to adjust how much sugar you add all right so I'm also gonna add in some cocoa powder for an extra richness a flavor and some sugar to add some more sweetness and let's just whisk this together until it is fully combined now you see when you're starting to mix it together before all the chocolates melted it kind of just looks like chocolate milk with little bits of chocolate in it but once the chocolate fully melts it'll end come together to a nice fully homogeneous mixture and what's really cool is were basically making like a chocolate ganache but that's like a super thin chocolate ganache instead of just using cocoa powder it's gonna be extra thick from the chocolate all right so now let's label this end you may notice I have a matching label yes I am extra like that so let's pour in that hot cocoa look at the steam oh my gosh this looks absolutely incredible I wish you guys could smell it it has the most amazing chocolatey smell wafting off of this let's take our spoons and spoon on top some of this marshmallow floral look at that gone are the days where it is cool just to put basic marshmallows in but no we are putting in homemade marshmallow fluff a nice large dollop right on top of there and now just because it would it be complete if we didn't just do a little more let's take some of our chocolate chips if you had a bigger piece of chocolate it'll be easier but it only have chocolate chips and grate on top a little bit more there you go look at all my god it's kind of hot look at how insanely delicious this looks you have that thick hot cocoa in there you have the nice and super like just like airy and delicious marshmallow fluff on top and the way I like to eat this because it's so thick is I take this spoon get a nice piece of that marshmallow fluff that kind of ruins the look but that's all good gets a piece of that marshmallow fluff get some of the hot cocoa and you a nice a little spoonful I almost kind of eat it like a soup that's how good it is make this at home and I dare you to tell me that you've had better huh Coco Venus let's go over it the actual hot cocoa itself has such a rich chocolaty flavor because we used both chocolate chips and cocoa powder and get layers of that chocolate flavor the milk chocolate uses kind of more of like a subtle like creamy chocolate flavor and the dark chocolate from the cocoa powder it gives it a nice little bitterness that goes really well with the sweetness in the hot cocoa from the sugar and the sweetness of this marshmallow fluff this is literal heaven this is all I want like a snow day when we know in our school this in front of the TV with my cat and maybe some penne alla vodka this is just out of this world all right I'm gonna get out real quick cuz I probably have marshmallow all over my face and I want to finish eating this but as always if you want the fluorescent the link to it is in the search box below if you haven't

boiling water whisk this mixture together until it's nice and creamy add in your salt and vanilla extract and with the mixer on slowly add in your water and whisk slowly until all your water is used up as you can see it's now quite runny add in your golden syrup and carry on whisking until it is nice and thick this will take quite a while as you can see I've been mixing for a while and it's quite runny still keep on mixing and as you notice the peaks are there but they are running into the mixture they're mixing into the mixture and then are staying up so just keep on mixing until it's nice and thick like this and you can see that the peaks are staying in place when this is ready remove it from the heat and put it to one side and then start whisking until it comes to room temperature it's much thicker than it was before as you can see if I place some of the mixture between my fingers it's nice and creamy and thick and this is it that's how to make homemade marshmallow fluff thanks

you it's one of my favorite frostings it only takes four ingredients and it is super simple to make normally i would make it in my stand mixer but i'm gonna do it in a bowl here today to just so you can see it a little bit better um again there's nothing hard about it it's super simple i've got a cup of butter in here um softened and whipped so that it's nice and smooth i'm gonna add some powdered sugar so this is an american buttercream frosting that means that it's powdered sugar and butter based um but we're only going to add two cups of powdered sugar here so that's significantly less than my like traditional american buttercream instead we're going to add some marshmallow flour you wouldn't think that would make a big difference in the flavor but it really does so this is going to be perfect i'm going to use this for some oatmeal cream pie bars um but we've also used it on cakes it's delicious on like a a chocolate cake with a with some graham crackers for like a s'mores style dessert you can really use it it'd be wonderful in between like layers of whoopie pies you can really use it for a lot of things so we're going to go ahead and get the second cup of powdered sugar mixed in here like i said i would normally do this in my stand mixer with my paddle attachment when you're doing an american buttercream you don't want to get too much air whipped in you do want it to be nice and light and fluffy but you don't want it full of air bubbles so that's why you would normally use the paddle attachment go ahead and get this whipped in as much as we can here i'm going to add a teaspoon of vanilla and then the star of the show a seven ounce container of marshmallow fluff this will help bring it all together this frosting pipes beautifully um you can do it on cupcakes you can make nice fluffy uh roughly um piping you can also it's great for layer cakes i've done three layer cakes with this frosting it's just really nice it's easy to work with and it's not too sweet look in the recipe with the marshmallow fluff and powdered sugar you might think it is but it's not [Music] [Music] all right now this is more than enough frosting for a nice 9x13 cake or maybe 12 cupcakes if you're doing a layer cake um or more cupcakes you might want to go ahead and double the recipe it's super delicious like i said so you're not going to regret having extra so as you can see it's super smooth and really tasty they're marshmallow fluff buttercream here i can't tell you how tempted i was to pipe this on i even had a piping bag out but it just didn't seem right for a um oatmeal cream pie bar for some reason so we'll just spread it on it makes it fast and [Music] easy [Music] all right there we go", "KgQSP3spxA0": "what's up guys it's your girl aries ashley here with your first quickie candle comparison video all right so a lot of you guys have been asking me is vanilla bean marshmallow and marshmallow fluff the same candle so i decided to burn one in the bedroom and another in the living room so right now we're burning vanilla bean marshmallow in the bedroom and i want to go ahead and quickly jump into this comparison so the scent notes which is not really scent notes on vanilla bean marshmallow is more of a description it says a comforting vanilla fragrance that evokes a sweetness of homemade marshmallow with essential oils okay so i don't believe that these two candles are the same scent this one is much heavier on the vanilla in my opinion and the throw is like a five here okay as to where the other one which we'll get into momentarily has a much better throw and the scent is more edible this scent here is not as gourmand as marshmallow fluff this one is not as sweet and not as edible it's not as yummy it's good and and you know what else maybe this scent is more maybe the vanilla bean marshmallow could possibly be a tad bit more versatile versus if you don't necessarily want to for example burn a super gourmand scent in your office vanilla bean marshmallow would be the one you would want to burn is lighter it wouldn't be as um i don't want to say offensive but you know to some people because a lot of people do not like gourmand scents this one in that case would be less offensive um it's it is still sweet but it's not nearly as sweet as the marshmallow fluff and i don't really want to talk too much about the marshmallow fluff right now i'm going to go in the room so that we can discuss that one but yeah for me this one here the the difference as of right now is vanilla bean marshmallow is more vanilla bean than marshmallow and a little bit less it's less edible yeah all right on to the next all right you guys so we're back at marshmallow fluff so the scent notes on marshmallow fluff are fluffy marshmallow creamy vanilla whipped sweet cream with essential oils um you know off rip let me just start out by saying this the throw is there i can smell this one the throw is a seven here and the scent itself smells like way more creamy in my opinion sweeter and more edible this one should have i feel like they need to switch the names i feel like um the vanilla bean marshmallow should be this one and then marshmallow fluff should be the other one because this one according to the description and that that's why i'm saying this i'm saying this based on the description of what vanilla bean marshmallow says it's supposed to be it's supposed to evoke the feeling of homemade marshmallows that's what this one does i feel like marshmallow fluff more accurately fits that description than the vanilla bean marshmallow does one because you can smell this one two it's oh my gosh it even it smells almost buttery like this smells gourman the other one does not smell gourmand in my opinion in my opinion y'all okay don't don't come at me so you asked and this this is my answer i don't believe they're the same candle in this verses let's get excited is the winner it gets the championship belt i will repurchase this one i actually did repurchase the vanilla bean marshmallow and while i like it the throw is like a five y'all what am i supposed to do with that what am i supposed to do with that so uh if you have the option to you know buy either or me personally if you really want that marshmallow [Music] let me let me eat this right now yummy experience go with the let's get excited go with the marshmallow fluff i feel like this one is is much better in my personal opinion all right you guys i hope this was helpful and i will talk to you all in the next one okay toodles you", "3l1SY3QREv4": "g'day welcome to the simple cooking Channel today I'm going to show you how I make a marshmallow cake this is so mushy it is so mellow this is awesome so let's go now for this get a large saucepan put in 3 cups of granulated sugar about 3 tablespoons of unflavored gelatin then add about 2 cups that will slightly over 2 cups of cold water just mix this together until it's combined well now turn your heat on to anywhere from medium to high and just give this a stir every now and then we want to bring this to a boil now as you can see it's starting to boil turn it right down to low and then we just leave it for 10 minutes do not stir it at all as you can see this is why I said you need a big big saucepan or pot this one is a 5 liter capacity so it's going to boil and bubble and froth not far from the top so don't use a small or a medium when you need a big one and it should just look like this for pretty much the whole 10 minutes alright now that's ready turn the heat off and take this off the heat and let it sit for about 10 minutes get a large mixing bowl and pour the syrup in there once it's cooled then add one tablespoon of vanilla extract you can use a different extract if you want a different flavor and some food coloring really depends how vibrant you want the color you don't need that many get a hand mixer and just beat this for as long as it takes for this to turn marshmallowy could take 5 or 10 minutes you know just pour it in that's done now if you want to add a bit of color just put some hundreds and thousands over the top or I think they're also called sprinkles so just leave this on the counter to set or chucked in the fridge make it really fast but I hope you like this so so awesome and yummy we bounce you off the walls for a while with this I'll see you next time for my next meal", "XsqovQPk_k0": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to another hobby husky video today's video will be short and sweet we are making some marshmallow fluff and I start out with a cup of hot water and I put in some jell-o gelatin and it is orange and then I follow it with another 1/2 cup of water chill that for 15 minutes in the fridge and then pull it out and I put in a box of Godiva white chocolate pudding and I really think this makes it it's very hard to stir in though but stir that up and then we will chill it for another 15 minutes in the fridge take it out and fold in a tub of Cool Whip and this is where it gets kind of creative after you fold in the Cool Whip I add in some little mandarin oranges that you buy in the little snack packs and one of them had a seed so I just take it out and put in some marshmallows and I started with a cup and then I started with a cup of pineapples as well and those are pineapple tidbits but I ended up adding a lot more marshmallows and a lot more pineapple because those are my favorite parts of these kind of salads I call them I call it marshmallow salad but it's called marshmallow fluff I think in the real world you and stir it all together and refrigerate it for an hour or two and then you can take it to your potluck and that is it thank you for watching another hobby husky video please like and subscribe for future videos", "zT2shsJqyG0": "today we're gonna make an easy marshmallow fluff frosting um it only has three ingredients and it comes together in a flash and then you're ready to frost any cupcakes or cakes or s'mores situations that you have this is your frosting now marshmallow frosting is actually super easy it's really just three ingredients in the bowl for a stand mixer you're going to want to add your sugar and your egg whites they don't have to be any sort of temperature or anything like all that's nonsense you could just ignore that we're basically just making a swiss meringue so we're going to heat our egg whites and sugar that i've just combined um over bay marie until they reach 130 degrees on a thermometer and then we're going to beat them until they reach the peaks super easy and i'm just going to whisk these together i like to kind of whisk in the sugar to the egg whites before i put it on the hot water because otherwise and the egg whites will start to cook and you don't want that so i've got my mixture here and i'm going to put that on top of my my water you don't want your water to touch your um the bottom of your bowl add um just a pinch of salt and that will stabilize but also um it does add a little flavor as well and then we are going to whisk this constantly yeah arm workout it gets easier if you start to heat up because it kind of loosens up but the beginning part is definitely the toughest i don't want to miss when it hits um 1 30. i usually take it off around 125 because it will keep continue cooking so you can see it's starting to get a little bit more fluffy um it's looking a little lighter so it's around 94 degrees um and so i'm just going to keep going so the way you check this without a thermometer is you're going to kind of touch it and make sure that there's no granules and then it is hot it feels tough to the touch it's definitely done you can see that it's nice and light and fluffy and that there are no there's no visible sugar um and so we're gonna go ahead and pop it in our mixer kind of start it on medium and then crank it up to high every now and again you're going to want to check it you don't want to over beat it you can you can definitely over whisk it um so just go in there with your your wick and kind of pull it out and see if it holds a stiff peak and this is that is not a stiff peak check it again looks great so it's going to look smooth and shiny and glossy and oh yes that my friends is well it's like four stiff peaks reviewing pleasure so we are going to add our vanilla you can add a different extract if you'd like you can flavor with coffee or a lemon or really anything you'd like um that would complement the flavors of whatever you're going to frost but i'm going to do law you can fold it in by hand but honestly it just takes longer and that's it now you've made marshmallow fluff or marshmallow frosting it's basically just a swiss meringue and this is ready for whatever application you want so you can put it into a piping bag and pipe it onto cupcakes or you can just frost the outside of a cake with it and then give it a nice little torch um to toast it or you can top like your s'mores if you want to be fancy and you don't feel like making your own marshmallows just saying um it's really i mean it's pretty fabulous",

"U8uBuvFXuXg": "- If you love peanut butter fudge, and you've never had\ngreat success making it, then you're not going to\nwant to miss this recipe. It's an easy, four ingredient, foolproof peanut butter fudge. Hey, everyone, it's Dorothy\nwith crazyforcrust.com, and welcome back to my kitchen. Today, we're talking about\nfudge, peanut butter fudge. Now, I have tried so many different peanut butter fudge recipes, and either I didn't love them or I couldn't get them to set up. I've had so many issues over the years, trying to find the perfect\nrecipe until I tried this one. It's foolproof, it only\nhas four ingredients, and it's super peanut buttery. You're going to love\nthis recipe, I promise. For more delicious\ndesserts and easy recipes, be sure to subscribe to my channel. Now, let's get in the kitchen. The first step to making fudge is getting all of your\ningredients together. It's really important, because fudge making is kind of fast, and you don't want to have to stop to measure out anything or prepare a pan. So measure out all your ingredients, and prepare a nine-inch\npan by lining it with foil and spraying it with\nnonstick cooking spray. When it comes to peanut butter, make sure that you're using a\nregular store peanut butter, like Skippy or Jif or one of those. Don't use a natural one\nthat you have to stir. Combine two cups of granulated sugar and 1/2 of a cup of whole milk\nin a three-quart saucepan. Heat it over medium heat\nand bring it to a boil, stirring it constantly. Make sure that it's a rolling boil, that is a very strong\nboil, not just a simmer. Once it starts to boil, set a timer and boil it for three minutes, stirring it constantly. And then remove it from the heat. Immediately stir in 1 1/2\ncups of creamy peanut butter and one jar, or seven\nounces, of marshmallow cream. The mixture's going to be\nnice and thick like this. If it's not, there's a chance that you didn't cook it long enough, or at a strong enough boil. Spread it into the prepared pan, and then cool it to chill it and set it. See what I mean? Making fudge is really, really fast. That's why it's really important to measure out your\ningredients beforehand. Once your fudge is set, you can easily lift it out\nof the pan using the foil, and then slice it into one-inch pieces. You're going to store this\nin an airtight container or store it in the refrigerator. It'll last a few weeks. This is also great for shipping. It's great for the holidays, or just anytime that you're feeling like a piece of peanut butter fudge. Like I said this is a\nfoolproof fudge recipe. I promise you it will work, it will set up, it will\ntaste like peanut butter. It's going to be soft and creamy. It's perfect. I know you're going to love it. I'm putting this fudge\nrecipe in the freezer, yes, the freezer, for the holidays. You keep watching for\nmore Christmas recipes.", "78-6NdD1mS8": "[Music] hi I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm today we're going to make chocolate marshmallow fudge or maybe you know what is fantasy fudge and this is what it looks like it is wonderfully creamy smooth with a rich and sweet chocolate flavor and one of the great things about this fudge is how easy it is to make now whenever you make candy it is a good idea to read over your recipe a few times so you're familiar with it and also have out all your ingredients pre-measured so what you will need is a nine inch square that's 23 centimeter baking pan and I like to line it with the bottom and sides with the piece of aluminum foil and make sure you have a bit of an overlap of the foil because what we're going to do is make if you have this you can just grab a hold of it and lift the fudge out but when we're about to cut it makes so much easier so I like my fudge to have nuts now if you prefer without you can just simply leave out your nuts I'm and also if you prefer maybe some dried fruit you can you can use a combination of nuts and fruit or just fruit I mean really this is up to you so what I like to do is add about one and a half cups that's 150 grams of chopped nuts now you can use whatever your favorite nut is you know walnuts are good pecans hazelnuts almonds pistachios I mean really whatever you like and actually I'm going today I'm going to use a combination of walnuts and pecans 3/4 of a cup that's 75 grams of each and I like to toast my nuts because I find that really brings out their flavor so I put my pecans and walnuts on the same baking sheet because they take a boat of saying the same time to toast so put them in a 350 degree Fahrenheit which is a 180 degrees Celsius oven for about maybe 8 10 minutes until they're lightly toasted and you can always tell when notes are done because you can smell them and then take them out let them cool and then coarsely chopped like I've done here and then the other thing you need to have ready is your chocolate now you can either use your favorite - semi-sweet chocolate bar and just chop it up or you can use chocolate chips so if you want to use a chocolate bar use 12 ounces which is 340 grams of your like I said your semi-sweet chocolate or 2 cups of your favorite semi-sweet chocolate chips and have that and also you will need I like to add a little flavoring vanilla extract again you could leave that out I'm adding one and a half teaspoons now just put that to the side because we're not going to add that right away we're going to add those ingredients at the end so what you will need to make our fudge is a heavy bottom pretty large saucepan and what I'm going to do is put in two cups that's 400 grams of granulated white sugar and then four tablespoons 55 grams of butter I like to use unsalted you could use salt it whichever you like and I just cut it into small cubes so it melts faster and then I'm adding a little salt a quarter of a teaspoon and then I'm adding one five ounce can of evaporated milk that's a hundred and sixty milliliters or two thirds of a cup now don't confuse evaporated milk with sweetened condensed milk they're not the same thing evaporated milk is just plain unsweetened milk that too has about 60% of the its water removed and then our last ingredient because this is called marshmallow fudge we are going to add one seven ounce container which is 198 grams by weight of marshmallow cream and the this gives us that really creamy smooth fudge and marshmallow does help to prevent sugar crystallization which means granny fudge which we don't want and that's why we use this because it will prevent that now make sure when you're buying your marshmallow fluff or cream you check the expiry date because just like if you buy marshmallows and they're old they're kind of you know it's not nice and creamy smooth you can see this is really sticky stuff but so good okay so now what we're gonna do is bring all these ingredients up to a boil now you want to do that medium medium-low sweep us sorry medium-low heat because you want it to slowly come up because we don't want it to burn a lot of sugar in here and we don't want it to burn and stir it constantly now will prevent that from happening okay so work almost at a boil here so once it's at a boil there's two ways you can do this one you can just set your kitchen timer for five minutes and just let it cook for five minutes of course you want to stir it constantly either with I have a heatproof spatula here or you can use a wooden spoon the other way is to use a candy thermometer you could either use a digital or you can use the mercury type and cook the mixture till it reaches 230 degrees Fahrenheit which is 110 degrees Celsius now the reason I say time it is because it does take five minutes about five minutes for this mixture to come to the 230 degrees so if you don't have a candy thermometer it's kind of a great thing just to be able to time it but I'm going to just put my probe in here and just keep like I said just keep stirring it constantly okay so we're now at 2:30 I'm gonna remove from the heat my thermometer out and then I'm going to add all of my chocolate and just stir I'm just going to use my spatula wooden spoon or you could even use a wire whisk do you like just keep stirring until all of your chocolate has melted which happens pretty fast because syrup is our fudge is so warm you start to smell that chocolate okay not that we've done so now what I'm going to do is add all of my nuts chopped nuts and I have vanilla see this is really easy to make me and what a great gift people always like to get fudge okay so now all that's left is pour it into our pan okay that's good and then with even just use the back of the spoon or a knife or I'm just using an offset spatula there I'm just going to spread it out nice and evenly and then what we're gonna do is just leave this for about an hour - depending on how warm your kitchen is just until it becomes nice and firm so just leave it like that and when we come back I'll show you how to take it over the pan and cut it into squares so it's been about an hour and my fudge is nice and firm its cooled down so just take the sides of your foil and just lift it right out of the pan and then just peel back the foil and then I like to trim up the edges so just kind of cut just a little off and put that aside kind of the cooks treat nibble on that and then because this fudge is quite rich I prefer to just cut it into probably about one inch to two and a half centimeter pieces although of course you can cut it any size you want just like that and then I will give it a try very nice it's very creamy and smooth from that marshmallow cream and then the chocolate flavor of course and then I like them that's nice crunch of the nuts you know it's great to give us gifts for Christmas what's wonderful is it so easy to makes you make large batches and then just wrap it up a nice little box or something and give it as gift now you can cut one store this in the refrigerator several days or what's really nice is this freezes so well so just make sure it's well wrapped put it in your freezer last several months and enjoy and until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy of baking calm [Music]", "o4WWX7UwRrA": "[Music] hello and welcome to Stacey DS kitchen today I am so excited because I'm going to show you how to make your own marshmallow fluff and today I'm going to show you the base fluff and from that the opportunities are endless you can put Oreos in it any biscuit you like in it toffee sprinkles whatever you want but first of all we need to know how to make the base fluff first of all you put you pour in the sugar into your husband like that and then I like to put the water on top so that's the warm water that just helps it to stop boiling up a little bit quicker and then you're pouring in the glucose syrup glucose syrup can be very very difficult actually it's pouring so what I'm going to do is use a spoon I've put in some hot water just to help all the glucose syrup get into the pan it's very very sticky and gloopy if you can turn on the hob to about medium-high temperature and you're going to slowly and carefully just stir it until it's combined this should take about a minute what you want to do now is you want to put the lid on your saucepan and you want to take the sugar up to a boiling point and leave the lid on for around 4 to 5 minutes what this will do is it will self clean the size of the pan which means that you don't have to worry with pastry brushes or anything and you know that your sugar is not going to crystallize and it'll be perfect pour in your egg whites which have to be at room temperature it's really important that they're at room temperature because it makes them much much more volumous when you're whisking them up and then going to throw in the cream of tartar and my pinch of salt start your stand mixer on low speed you want your egg whites to stay in their foamy stage if the egg whites and foamy stage that when you pour the sugar syrup into it you'll find that they will puff up really really quickly we're now going to turn up little Lord to make sure that the eggs get into their foam this stage and we're going to keep that going around whilst the sugar syrup is boiling as you can see the sugar syrup is now boiling nicely come on come and have a look the sides are all clean because the steam hose delphine decides now what we have to do is we have to let our sugar syrup bubble up until it reaches 116 degrees so it's very important to take it up to that temperature because if you don't then you're not gonna have really really thick fluff and it's very important you get a thick fluff and the way you do that is to get your sugar syrup up to the right temperature this is not one for the children by the way I'm gonna turn this up just slightly now I'm gonna have another look at the egg whites staying in their foamy saved that is foamy stage let's have a look and check the temperature I think it's gonna be a 110 but I might be wrong so we all get it up to 116 so don't worry that's absolutely fine just put your thermometer out over onto something safe and we'll check again in a minute come on come on there we are we're almost there when you are testing be very careful not to touch the bottom of the pan because if they're taken thermometer reading and touch the bottom of the pan it won't be the correct reading 116 yes 116 it is safe to turn off the hole now this is where it gets a little bit dangerous so be very careful you haven't got any children around for this part okay now at this point we have to pour in our sugar syrup quite quickly into the foaming egg whites at the same time what we're gonna do is when I want to speed up to full speed be careful you know when it's flirting out anywhere and now right up to full speed get every last bit you can now we're gonna set the timer for seven minutes after seven minutes you should have beautiful fluff very exciting cuz it's time to have a look now there you go this is how your marshmallow fluff wants to look after whoo after about six seven minutes of blending so I'm just put one teaspoon of vanilla bean paste in and then I'm gonna mix it in again what we're going to do now it's going to separate it into two the vanilla marshmallow fluff is going to be used for a couple of recipes which I'm going to show you later and I'm also going to do something very special with the other half you want to do just walk it on the side don't worry it's not fragile [Music] that's Triberr nice let me push it down the sides here i'ma gonna scoop it into the jars now any any tool thing will work just to help you when you're filling just to give you a little bit stability when you'll feel it when you're filling a piping bags okay so that's that around about a half I'd say pick up the piping bag but that lovely push it down twist it and that's ready to go in the fridge next one this particular one I've decided I'm going to make lemon flavor and the reason for that is in the next video you're going to see how I make my ginger lemon and ginger whoopie pies with a lemon marshmallow fluff and all you have to do to make it lemon fluff is put half a lemons worth of zest throw it in boof boof boof don't worry too much if it's very lemony or not very lemony it's up to you how much lemon you like and whisk it in this will give it just a nice hint of lemon that's done already to fill a piping bag so there you have it your own marshmallow fluff wou that you can use to sandwich anything together if you liked this video then please click the

basical banana into delicious soft-serve ice cream and how to turn a lonely little zucchini into noodles well today I'm showing you another magic trick one that's equally as cool as making a Rubik's Cube fix itself by placing it in a paper bag except my tricks yum here I'm showing you how to turn that mucky water you find inside a candidate chickpeas into a healthy marshmallow fluff by pulling it out of a paper bag just kidding now what do we pulled oh right there's this trend going around that I definitely did not start where you can take the usually discarded water from a can of chickpeas apparently called aqua fava because what else would you call chickpea canned water and whip it into the texture of perfect marshmallow fluff so I figured on this one to eat Wednesday when I'm about to head to my beach vacation where I'm surely gonna be sourcing it ups more than once I'd show you the healthiest tastiest and definitely most magical thing to make when you want healthy s'mores but you don't have a campfire coz s'more FOMO I'm Talia from party in my clans calm and I'm about to abracadabra this will follow and make a healthy campfire free s'mores parfait for the chocolate portion of the s'mores you're gonna make a creamy dreamy avocado chocolate pudding which actually come to think about it is magic in and of itself I mean pudding from avocado so to do that you're gonna take the flesh from two ripe avocados and scoop them right into your food processor then you're gonna add in 1/2 cup of cocoa or cacao powder 1/2 of a cup of maple syrup 1 tablespoon of chia seeds which honestly in hindsight are totally unnecessary and I actually wouldn't even recommend it 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and 1/4 teaspoon of sea salt also added 1/2 a cup of almond milk and then process that dreamy creamy magic machine there it is oh and have to taste it I mean you got it taste your own attic now let's make your aqua fava marshmallow fluff so just take one can of chickpeas and drain it but instead of draining it into your sink which you would normally do you're gonna drain it into a bowl look at that aqua Baba kind of gross I know but just go with it then add in 1/3 cup of agave 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1/4 teaspoon of cream of tartar which will just help bind it all together and keep the fluffiness fluffy then you want a process with a mixer for 12 to 15 minutes yes that is quite a long time that's pretty much as long as a friends episode so you know what I did while I was doing it sat on my counter and watched friends also it kind of sucks that I have a hand mixer because that's a lot of freaking holding but it's so worth it this is about like 9 minutes in its row maybe 8 starting to get really foamy oh there we go that's 910 we're getting more creamy Dini oh you can see the ripples oh man look at that yeah that is magic if I've ever seen it that is about as crazy as cutting a person in half in a box what else is crazy is cutting a person a half in a box looking for graham crackers yo I found these in a health food store you could probably find them there too or online I'm just gonna crush them up with this nifty but pretty stupid technique you could also toss them in a food processor or use a rolling pin I don't know I just did this it works fine whatever then you're gonna assemble your s'mores parfaits so first goes your avocado pudding that is heavenly next is a sprinkling a not light dusting of the graham cracker chunks yummers and finally the fluff the marshmallow fluff now call me David Copperfield because that is legit magic in a bowl aka a healthy plant party deconstructed campfire free s'mores parfait yay and to take this trick up a notch try magically not eating them all in one campfire free sittings", "dmDV4O0FLGo": "Hey folks it is Barry here welcome to my virgin\nkitchen as you know I have just got back from America and today I am replicating something\nextremely naughty that I had over this is a fluffernutter basically a grilled cheese\nsandwich with peanut butter and marshmallow in except with this one it was a bit more\ngourmet it had banana and a dark chocolate pot oh wow! Yes that was absolutely sensational, loads\nof you have asked for a fluffernutter before but I had never had one. So now I have had one properly I wanted to\nmake one myself if you want to have a go at making this banana optional chocolate optional\nbut please do that, so so good. Hit pause on the video now write down these\ningredients, lets do it. So to make the fluffernutter the first thing\nto do just like making a grilled cheese is grab your two slices of bread and butter each\nside, now all you do once you have a good old coating on there is flip them over so\nthey are butter side down and start to add on the peanut butter I used smooth peanut\nbutter but you could use crunchy if you like so get your peanut butter on there. Then coat with your marshmallow fluff you\ncan completely bombard it on there or just put a smaller amount on there, the more you\nput on the more it will get all gooey and messy when you cook it you may like it like\nthat, then simply add your banana slices or strips. I went for strips today as I was feeling a\nbit kinky. Then you get one of those and flip that sandwich\npiece on top of the other piece of bread and that is basically the sandwich made. All you do now is add it to a pan over a medium\nto low flame, remember we do not lubricate the pan because the butter on the bread does\nthat for us. Cook it for around 3 minutes either side until\nlightly golden brown flipping it with a spatula. Once it is all done rest it down and cut into\nwedges and shove it in your chocolate dumping pot looking absolutely amazing, as you saw\nat the start of the video I loved it. Phoebe do you like it? Can you give us a noise that shows how much\nyou like that right now? \ufffdyeeeeeeey!\ufffd amazing ok then so if you\ntry this recipe send me a picture @myvirginkitchen remember the banana and chocolate are optional\nlet me know what you want to see next and we will see you again next time.

and beat it on high speed for about six to ten minutes and I only have can you stop I'm trying to sleep anyway so we have to beat this in the hand mixer for about six to ten minutes on high speed until the mixture becomes fluffy so we will see you guys once we're ready to make the marshmallow fluff okay so it already looks like a hundred times better they're very fast not your problems you try to make and it already is not so good we have about nine more minutes to go okay okay so like I said before my sister's oven is a convection oven so I didn't leave it in the oven for the for thirty minutes I actually left it in for about a few minutes less I would say twenty seven minutes in total okay it's time for the marshmallow fluff so I'm just gonna eyeball how much to put in here it smells so nice cuz I'm gonna use a whisk and just add water it says like 120 moles of water for the whole bag but I'm gonna add a little bit at a time okay once this is what the brownie it looks like it has a little bit of these I think when it was baking it rose up on the sides and then it kind of collapsed so that's why we have that situation but there's like chocolatey gooeyness puddles oh I'm so ready to put this in my belly but I'm gonna let this cool down fully before we put on the marshmallow fluff this is what the marshmallow fluff looks like it should stay like this pretty much I might just pop it into the fridge while we wait for the brownies to cool down so I'm just gonna cut this it's just it has a crispy coating on the top you guys and in the center is almost like gooey and fudgy this is the base brownie I have ever made a miner do you guys see that it has like a crispy color on the top and bottom oh okay so what I did with the leftover potato potato chips chocolate chips is that I kind of crushed it with a little rolling pin and then put it in the fridge so it kind of solidified and I'm going to use that as garnish mmm story doctoring mmm wait wait wait wait wait somebody for somebody for them take a picture how is it savor it while you're rushing it shop good is it tasty very good is it way better than the last time mm-hmm it's fudgy this time it's a weird negative thumbs up mm-hmm okay you guys push your pop you go back to the Safari thing take your brownie with you yay and that you guys is a brownie success I'm so excited this is the fuzziest tastiest brownies I have ever made in my entire life and I think the marshmallow fluff is just gonna add to it but I'm gonna make myself one and then I'll let you guys know the tea but I also need to make something like sustain brother-in-law so let me do that also okay okay let's taste because the rain is actually coming down that's how that crispy layer to get through but oh look at that mmm

with our makeup I don't talk to you guys in the next time good bye oh sorry [Music]", "ctUPZbaRRFI": "a staple of the American diet marshmallow fluff has finally burst onto the scene but this is not just any marshmallow fluff oh no far be it to be the scrub tear everyday marshmallow fluff this is the strawberry marshmallow fluff having a now colored with the realest vegetable juice you could ever want for those unaware in the states we love marshmallow fluff we put on our eggs we put it on our chop suey and we put it on our never-ending desire to always want validation but today we're gonna be finding out what the hubbub is all about because I have never dabbled in this flock now giant jars of sugar aren't exactly anything new as a matter of fact Nutella is the greatest most famous of these types however what is a bit new is how they're trying to market it which is really bizarre and in this weird health-conscious facet by telling people it contains vegetable juice I don't exactly know anyone who picked up a jar of marshmallow fluff and then immediately put it down because it didn't contain enough vegetables but hey I haven't eaten a vegetable in 450 years so who knows maybe they're a lot better than I remember let's go and crack this bad boy in half oh good God Almighty well it's like bubblegum in a jar oh yeah it's fluffy alright it's one of the few foods that's actually made me a little nauseous just from the smell of it it's so unbelievably sweet like somebody has blended up a bunch of Care Bears and My Little Pony mascots and stuffed them inside of a jar the strawberry smell is reminiscent of hubble bubble bubble tape which is actually a point in its favour because I firstly love that come let's go and take a taste oh that's something else oh that's that's really something if you ever wanted to feel your teeth melting and sliding down the back ear throat this is the treat for you it is unbelievably sweet which to be fair it is liquefied marshmallow so I don't exactly know what I was expecting but my God Almighty there is a limit to sweetness and I to believe we've just hit it this strawberry flavor actually is not that bad granted it's fake I mean faker then samurais afraid to die but its own strangely satisfying to have and sort of necessary if you're gonna be eating this stuff by the spoonful the most American breakfast I ever did see oh it's like looking at my keyboard", "gjg6Fq6rcs8": "talk about condiments so if you could only use one for the rest of your life what would it be yeah ketchup mustard relish rancher lots of condiments to choose from Influenster calm release this map of the most popular ones in each state popular choices include Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing that was the favorite in five states Frank's Red Hot Sauce came out the top in four states Robert you sauce ketchup mustard and sriracha or all the popular other ones there on there too okay so this is where things get weird right taking the top spot here in Maine marshmallow fluff hmm I don't is that a condom it's not a condom I think it's an ingredient like like if you peanut butter in fluff sandwiches it's you know holy that I can think of that you would put it on top of something would be like hot chocolate right right I don't can't think of anything else I mean you're entitled to note think of it as a condiment if you want to I mean I don't know that it's in like in our in our like our our cabinet your cupboard yeah it hasn't been in our cupboard for four years since the kids turned like six tell you the last time I actually had it I love it it's great I know I would never turn it down but that's not the first thing I think of that's the truth so we've got a good conversation going on about this on our Facebook page and here's what some of you are saying yeah joe says everything is a condiment if you try hard enough hey that's the truth and Andy says bring back the raspberry we were sharing our favorite condiment sigh I don't have a favorite because it depends on you know what we're eating we came up with one that we had overlooked yeah that's so good it's made right here in Maine captain watts cam so sauce it's like a hot slightly sweet sauce it is the flavor balance is perfect and it's so good on everything from like eggs to you said you put it in chowder I put a yeah clam chowder so good I gotta try it I'm boring I just do catch-up yeah I'm gonna catch up guy all right well you are boring and there's no five-year-old palate again", "hK6eEBhsmYE": "hey guys it's bren and today i'm here with post burn reviews of two of the bath body works easter candles i'm going to talk about sweet carrot cake and marshmallow fluff so if you watched my haul video you know i picked up all three easter candles including the tutti frutti jelly bean but i realized the tutti frutti jelly bean is a repackage of champagne toast so i don't really need that so i think i'm gonna be returning or exchanging that one but i have been burning these other two quite a bit now so i'm back to tell you how they performed how i feel about them after i've burned them etc we'll start with the sweet carrot cake so the notes on this one are sweet cream cheese frosting fluffy carrot cake cinnamon spice and you know i'm not crazy about the label but it is what it is i do really like these bunny lids i think those are super cute um and that's on all the easter candles and the general consensus here is that this is a repackage of the old pumpkin carrot cake scent that came out many many years ago um and as i said in my haul i can totally see that this does feel like a fall scent to me but if you think about it there's a lot of commonality between the type of spices that are in carrot cake and pumpkin spice you know they both have cinnamon i'm pretty sure they both have like a touch of ginger allspice and all of that stuff uh nutmeg and so i like this candle quite a bit it still feels like fall to me though it still feels like i should be burning it in autumn and i think i probably will be hanging on to my other one until later in the year uh and burning it then i i think it's pretty authentic though i do think that the spices here are very similar to what you get in carrot cake um i'm getting mostly cinnamon of course but i do get like a nuttiness like a nutmeg a little bit of allspice i mean it's pretty close honestly what i don't know if i get is cream cheese frosting and i've heard quite a few people say that they do get that cream cheese note for me i get a frosting note for sure but i'm trying to get the cheesiness and i just really don't i feel like i just get more of like a vanilla or like a vanilla glaze maybe i can imagine that it's a cream cheese frosting but there's nothing really overtly like cream cheesy about it for me i think for me it just comes across as more like vanilla but it is there and that frosting note is nice because it kind of just smooths everything out sweetens up that spiciness and so i think the scent again is it's pretty close to how a carrot cake would smell uh for me it just feels like a fall scent it just reminds me in general of a lot of other bath body works fall candles it's giving me fall vibes i don't know how i feel about it this time of year but i haven't minded it i haven't minded burning it a little bit i just think i'd rather burn it and fall but i do like it overall um strength and throw on this one i'm gonna say it's like a seven like it's pretty decent um definitely you can smell it it's kind of starting to go up the stairs a little bit you know when i'm burning it down here um so it's like pretty strong like not killer but right where you want it to be um i haven't had any issues with the burn so far just trim your wicks um you know i haven't burned it that much but uh from what i have so far no issues and so yeah i recommend this one um you might want to save it for fall because just like i said that's what i'm going to do but maybe not maybe that's just me um i like to eat carrot cake year round i just i don't know i don't want to burn like a cinnamon spicy candle this time of year but you might other people might i don't know that's just my preference but i do like it overall i do like it i wouldn't be surprised if they did like bring it back in fall let's just wait and see but if it sells well now i could totally see them doing that okay moving on to marshmallow fluff let's get egg-cited uh again i'm like eh on the packaging but i like the lid and the notes on this one are fleshy uh fluffy marshmallow creamy vanilla and whipped sweet cream and this is definitely a returning scent they bring this back here and there it's really the same scent as vanilla bean marshmallow this might have been the first release of vanilla bean marshmallow but it came back the spring after that um it's it's been out all the time it was out for candle day but it was an online exclusive um this was out last year for easter as well so it's not anything new but i haven't burned it in a while so i decided to include it in this review it's been years actually since i have for me what marshmallow fluff vanilla bean marshmallow smells like is it's a lot like vanilla pumpkin marshmallow but without the pumpkin spice you have to kind of take that out of there um it's the same marshmallow that they use in a few different places um the new york cherry cheesecake candle kind of has that same marshmallow in it as well uh but i really like this candle because i feel like it's a solid like just kind of sweet vanilla scent for when you just want a bakery candle or like a nice vanilla but you're not in the mood for it to be like blueberry or cherry or any particular you know other type of like fruit or spice you just want like a good vanilla because i'm not really a big fan of their buttercream frosting or their frosted cupcake those always kind of turn a little funky and bitter for me this one i think is better it does smell like marshmallow but um that marshmallow is good it sweetens up the vanilla i don't know i like it so i started burning this one and it just reminded me of how much i do actually like this candle but my only complaint is that it seems to have been better on the first few burns and some bath body works candles are like that where they just smell a little sweeter uh and kind of yeah just sweeter like the first couple burns and you think oh i love this candle it's so good and then like by fifth burn i'm like it's not really smelling as sweet anymore it's kind of starting to turn so i don't know how this is gonna do as we get down past the halfway point because i'm not there yet um but i have really been enjoying it so far so i do recommend picking one up if you're on the fence about it even though it is a basic scent that returns all the time i just i don't know i've really been enjoying it it's not that strong though so strength and throw i would give it a five like i would put it right in the middle it's um like if i'm burning it on the kitchen counter i can smell it in the kitchen but it's not even really going into the main part of the living room it's definitely not going up the stairs or anything else uh but it's there in the kitchen you know it's not like you have to get right next to it to smell it so like for me it's just medium it's just it's right in the middle there it's not too weak it's not horrible but it's not really strong it's probably a little less intense than most bath body works candles however it's like it's there like you can smell it it's just it's just a five out of ten it's just in the middle burn wise haven't had any issues yet uh but if you have burned this one quite a bit you've burned it more recently and you've gotten to the bottom feel free to drop a comment below about how it performed for you to the very end since i'm not at the end yet i might exchange the extra tutti frutti jelly bean i have for another one of these i haven't decided yet but it's just a nice sweet vanilla marshmallow scent you know it's probably why they keep bringing it back um so those are my thoughts on the bath body works easter releases stay tuned because i'm going to come back and review those new tropical candles that i also had in my haul uh so i'll have that video up soon and in the meantime you can follow me on instagram candles and music thanks for watching i'll see you later bye", "R9OpP4v9hSw": "what's up guys it's your girl aries ashley here with another quickie candle review and today i am burning let's get excited which is marshmallow fluff uh by bath and body works from the easter collection the scent notes on let's get excited are fluffy marshmallow creamy vanilla whipped sweet cream with essential oils omg y'all okay so let's talk about the packaging it's so cute um it is a wrap around and it has the little um chickies all over the packaging which is super cute i really like this one um yeah i just think that's really sweet i think they did a good job i even like the font on this one um the burn this is i think like my fifth burn on this candle the wax color was white but you could see that it got um it started setting and all that jazz and it got dirty which you know it kind of sucks because i like to have a clean wax but nonetheless the scent is so delightful i've been burning this one um in the bedroom mostly at night i'm burning it in the morning now so i could do this review for you guys but i've been burning this one mostly at night and it's so relaxing like the sweet marshmallow smell it's just so very yummy and creamy and it's just really really good um goose creek also has a really good marshmallow i think there's it's called marshmallow sugar or something like that um yeah i'll put it in the description with the goose creek what it's called but aside from that this marshmallow fluff by bath and buyer works i really do like it um it is a repurchase for me i would definitely buy this one again because i do really enjoy it the throw is a solid seven so it's um it's really decent i think this is a pretty decent candle i would give this to my foodie friends and to my um sugary loving friends like my friends that just really like sweet smells i think this would be good for them because it's like a sweet vanilla and it's it's basic but it's basic in a good way it's more like um a positive symbol if you will all right you guys that's it for this quickie oh no it's not i got to show you the lid i normally don't care about the lid but look look it's a bunny face oh my gosh it's so cute all right y'all on to the next see you later toodles you", "_93jMyaPp98": "hey guys welcome to another episode of Lisa's eats and today we are making marshmallow fluff which is something that's in America which they use for s'mores for fudge it's just a bit hard to find in Australia so I'm going to show you how to make it yourself okay so what you're going to need is 3/4 a cup of icing sugar that's already been sifted 1 egg whites at room temperature 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla bean extract I don't have it so I'm using vanilla bean paste but I recommend the extract the hakka teaspoon of salt and 3/4 cup of white ones here my mum taught me this um yeah ok so it's a really easy recipe we just put everything in a bowl and who eat it it's great but we're gonna do little feed tricks to make sure that it stays nice and fluffy and firm okay so what we're going to do first is get our egg white and salt and we're going to beat them until they're nice and fluffy okay the reason we put salt in with the egg is it helps the egg whites film up a little bit and when you are egg whites will come together like this with soft peaks we're going to put our 3/4 cup of light corn syrup in and he pea now beat until it's doubled in size this should take about seven minutes then I mean your powdered sugar and vanilla extract now continue to beat for another two to three minutes okay guys so that's my recipe for marshmallow fluff this is what it looked like if anyone wants it but yeah it's delicious again you can make it before marshmallows for s'mores for our fluff or not or whatever that is it just says it on the back and you can even use this as icing on cupcakes and then you could even blowtorch it to give it that cool light look it's amazing like the possibilities for this recipe are endless and we would definitely be using it in future things I hope you like it and it's really good on its own look let me get it a little bit it's like sugary vanilla II miss but seriously imagine this on top like a chocolate cupcake and they try it nicely on a chocolate cupcake blow-torched and just toasted how the girl is like us more easy the video I think it tastes better than this I've never tasted that but I would take your word just be careful because we are using the raw egg whites in this it's not usually an issue but if you're pregnant I would not suggest it but it's delicious that's what I'm okay guys I hope you enjoyed watching this video if there's anything you want me to cook for you next time just comment in the section below and I'll see you next time", "Np6YAZ-pnSA": "bonnie i am back happy wednesday evening i am so windblown tonight so here in northeast ohio it got to like 52 degrees oh my goodness and i don't know if you guys remember a couple days ago i put a picture of the beach up of lake erie and it was all like arctic tundra snow i'm gonna put a picture up right here in like three days look how much the lake has thawed and i'm starting to see sand again so that was actually a fun thing um the only problem was um my daughter and i walked down there and it was literally like a slush fest i mean i i wore my tennis shoes which was really stupid and by the time i got back my feet were soaked because we were walking through like three inches of slush so that that was not the smartest move on my part oddly my feet didn't really get wet in the short time we were down there it was just like a slushy mess so anyway i am back home and um while i was gone i decided to light up let's get excited which is one of the new easter candles from bath and body works this is what the jar looks like you can see i've still got it burning here um it's got these cute little chicks on it it says let's get excited and it is marshmallow fluff the lid has got a cute little bunny whiskers on it i love the lid the lid is absolutely adorable um i kind of have some mixed feelings about this candle so i love the scent oh my goodness i'm just going to blow this one out real quick though so you can see it a little bit better it was burning really well by the way um so the set notes are fluffy marshmallow creamy vanilla and whipped sweet cream so i'm cold it smells amazing it's got kind of that vanilla bean vibe going on maybe a little bit sweeter um got kind of a marshmallow thing going on it smells absolutely like you want to eat it cold even like now the melting wax smells fabulous you can get a little bit of a better sense on what the jar looks like it's hard because it's reflecting off the lights um it is a wrap around by the way um so it smells absolutely wonderful perfect scent for easter i actually have the single wick here i love the single wick you guys that you crack me up i don't know why i prefer this jar design and i just love the yellow wax i think it's delightful i can smell this one all day it smells like marshmallow fluff i absolutely love it um the problem is it's not a super strong candle so like i said this is the yellow one um i would call this a low medium possibly even a high low it's that light i would not burn this one in an open room and expect to get a lot of scent out of this one this is one that you could probably burn in like a small kitchen or like a bedroom but if you're gonna try it in an open room i don't think you're gonna get a lot of sun off of this one and i think it's kind of by design not that it's not meant to be strong but the problem is i think this scent is it just isn't a very strong candle you i think it's hard to get um a strong scent out of creamy uh marshmallow i can't i can't stop smelling it though there's no musk there's no floral um i don't love this side of the jar it's cute i would put it out during easter but i would actually be more likely to turn it around like this and display it on like my coffee bar for easter i actually like the back of the candle better i don't know why it just looks a little bit more um kind of like holiday festive what thanks coco barking at um without being too like cartoonish i don't know um it's cute though i actually prefer the uh love every bunny candle so far in the easter collection that's the carrot cake i still have to get um the third one in the series which is tutti frutti jelly bean that one is like super sweet i had that one last year um oops let me move my soap here i should be more organized tonight and i'm not let me grab um tutti frutti jelly bean from last year this is what last year's look like the bunny and glasses um this was kind of whimsical and fun this one is just over the top like sugary sweet um but it was kind of a it was a nice easter candle i actually think i prefer the marshmallow fluff for easter over tutti frutti jelly bean i'll have to compare them this year even though it's a little bit lighter i just love smelling this wax i can't get over how much i love smelling it um but like i said there's the front again and i don't know it's one of those candles that the scent is amazing it's just really really light um i don't mind it so much because i've burned like candles and enjoyed them sometimes you just want a little bit of fragrance in the room at least i do i know other people and i don't blame them they're paying a lot of money for a candle and you want it to smell really strong so there's kind of two different camps on there and i understand on both sides so if you're looking for a light cozy marshmallow candle that looks cute for easter i would definitely pick that one up if you're looking for an easter candle um that's a lot stronger i would go with the carrot cake because that one um is still equally as cozy but you get that wonderful carrot cake i love that one so um it just depends on what you want you know what you guys vanilla being noel in the candle over christmas kind of has that same quality vanilla bean noel is not the strongest candle but i know a lot of people love it so i feel like um the marshmallow fluff is kind of in that same category it's funny because um over christmas sometimes we get it's a peppermint marshmallow i have a single wig um that one's pretty strong but for some reason um just a plain vanilla marshmallow definitely is not super strong but i love it so anyway let me know what you guys think of this candle and i will see you guys tomorrow bye bye", "d13JZTM6fYo": "hi it's Stacey from one hungry mama making homemade marshmallow cream growing up my mom was a total health nut and even though I've grown up to appreciate the way that she fed us then summer is her restriction backfired there are a few sugary foods that I just not shaped and marshmallow cream is one of them so marshmallow cream is pretty much sugar sugar with more sugar with a little bit of vanilla and egg whites thrown in and then sugar sugar sugar sugar even when you make it at home that's what it is but at least when you're making it homemade you know there aren't any other additives or chemicals so even though it's a sometimes food I do love to whip this up because I mean what's life without a good stuff another sandwich to make homemade marshmallow cream you're gonna need light corn syrup granulated sugar water egg whites cream of tartar salt and vanilla a quick note about corn syrup I know people feel funny about using it and you know it's really just another form of processed sugar when you do use it you should definitely use it sparingly it's really great for certain recipes like this marshmallow fluff or pecan pie otherwise I opted for regular sugar and this case you really needed and you should know that it is different than high fructose corn syrup at the end of the day though guys most nutritionists say that sugar processes in your body and wastes sugar processes in your body no matter what form you take it into so moderation is really the key to start you're gonna combine the corn syrup granulated sugar and water in a saucepan set over medium you want to mix it all up and till it dissolves and then we want to bring the mixture up to about 140 degrees doesn't have to be crazy exact anywhere between 140 and 145 would work but you will need a thermometer most recipes will call for a candy thermometer and of course that's best but whatever you have around I've used a meat thermometer and it works just fine you just need to tell the temperature in the meantime in the medium bowl you want to use an electric mixer to whisk the egg whites salt and cream of tartar until they become soft peaks when the sugar mixture is all ready to go it reach that hundred and forty degrees or thereabouts we're gonna slowly pour it into the egg way while you continue to the whole time then it's a mix mix mix beat beat beat beat beat keep going for about seven minutes until it's thick and glossy that's what it should really look like the marshmallow cream that you buy at the store then we have the vanilla this is where all that great marshmallow flavor comes back can you beat for another minute and then finally the results marshmallow homemade marshmallow cream will store in the refrigerator for up to two weeks so this makes quite a bit but don't worry use it up don't make it you can use this to make sandwiches or one of my favorite if to use this instead of Nutella and my team of butter companies click the link and go watch

this bath and body works candle review if you're a returning viewer or subscriber as always welcome back today i'm going to be doing a quick review of let's get excited which is marshmallow fluff this is one of the new candles from bath body works for the spring slash easter 2021 season they did have a handful of other candles in this collection if i have pictures of them i'll pop them up on the screen here to the best of my knowledge i saw three at least i know there's three circulating there's the one i have right here the let's get excited which of course is marshmallow fluff they also had a carrot cake which i am so bummed the location i went to did not have and then they also had a jelly bean one i did smell that one in store a little too sweet for my taste um so obviously i grabbed the marshmallow fluff i love a good vanilla a good bakery yummy scent um which is obviously why i opted for this one had they had carrot cake though i don't know you guys it would have been a toss-up i may have been i may have been trying the carrot cake one if i'm able to get my hands on the carrot cake i will absolutely get it i would love to try that one i'd love to do a review on that one so stay tuned i may wind up grabbing that one as well but today we're going to be reviewing let's get excited darling packaging on this candle before i dive into the actual review cute little wrap around little spring chickies and then one other detail i noticed i mentioned this on instagram but look at how cute i have a little bit of wax on there but look at how cute the lid is it's got a little bunny nose with cute little whiskers would have been cute if this was in white as well if they had white lids and black lids i feel like if you had the white you probably would have been able to see the cute little little bunny a little bit more but regardless very cute details as always from bath and body works and you clicked on this video to see a review so without further ado let's jump into the review i'll kick it off with the scent notes as i always do so the sentinels for marshmallow fluff include marshmallow sweet cream and vanilla bella what are you doing if you guys hear scratching noises bella has burrowed into the couch she's making a little a little hammock for herself so if you hear scratching that's the cat i actually had to put up those couch corner covers on the corner of the couch because she was getting a little out of control with her with her claws anyways if you hear noises that's the cat it's mid morning so she's like all hyper and running around maybe you guys will get a rare appearance of bella in the background um so those are the notes for marshmallow fluff what do i get from this candle on cold it just smells like a really good yummy vanilla fragrance honestly to me it's similar um not exactly the same but very very similar to like their vanilla bean it's got that vanilla type fragrance kind of that creaminess this does have more of a marshmallow note though like i get marshmallow fluff i just get like a fluffy marshmallow fragrance plus coupled with maybe a vanilla bean type action they're saying in the notes there's marshmallow fluff yes i absolutely get that they're saying there's like a cream yes i get like a creamy vanilla it just smells like if you opened a can of marshmallow fluff kind of smells like that maybe with a little bit more vanilla i just felt it'd be very versatile um the one thing though the downfall is the performance so um after burning this candle it is just very very light you guys it's um i was a little worried because vanilla bean can sometimes be a little bit lighter of a scent sometimes vanilla scents as good as they are they tend to be a little bit lighter to me i'm sitting right in front of this candle i obviously have it lit i'm really not smelling anything i did try this in an open room this is a third burn on it had it in open room totally got lost really could not smell it at all wound up moving it into the half bath which is where i test a lot of my candles if they're a little bit lighter i try them out in there in more of a controlled environment um and it it was still lost it just was not that noticeable um so kind of a bummer i really liked the scent those of you who were interested in this one and are looking for like a really strong just ooey gooey strong marshmallowy type fragrance sad to say that this one just did not throw for me in an open room one to ten ten of course being the strongest this is probably like a three or four uh in a smaller room throw a wise one to ten probably like a four and a half maybe five um you could probably maybe get away with melting this if you have like a candle plate warmer or a candle lamp maybe it would fare a little bit better so this is definitely not a repurchase for me don't know if there's batch variances floating around with this one maybe some of you have gotten a good throw out of it i i definitely did not um i'm still even on the fence of whether or not i'm gonna keep this one just because it's that light i just really can't smell it so if you guys have used let's get excited leave it in the comments below let me know what your thoughts are let me know if it through for you if you've tried any of the new easter candles from this collection if you've tried the carrot cake one i would love to hear your thoughts

show you how to make marshmallow cream marshmallow clinging or known as fluff if you live in New England it is quite possibly one of my favorite dessert but first let's crack two egg whites next we'll toss the two egg whites and 1/4 teaspoon of cream of tartar into your and now we're going to add the ingredients into a saucepan need 1/6 cup of water 1/4 of a cup of sugar and half a cup of light corn syrup I also consider marshmallow cream to be a very sexy dessert so sexy in fact I invited Matt Damon over as my date you know just for a little taste I'm just I'm sure this even gave him the message okay and then we'll be placing it on the stove and heating it to medium high so that it boils place sugar butter on stove and attach cooking thermometer so you want to boil that to about 245 250 now while it boils we need to make sure we whip up our egg whites all righty and then we're just going to let it sit there until we're ready to pour the sugar into the egg whites that Damon is coming I know it your mixer on low and pour the server down the side of the bowl in genetics turn your mixer up to high and let it whip up for a bet now a little bit of vanilla flavoring of white it's a payback my favorite way to eat it is just with a spoon I can't do the back you", "mrJcaCODMEo": "Hey guys! Today I'm going to show you how\nto make homemade marshmallow fluff Fair warning: this is a pretty time-consuming endeavor\nbut the results are more than worth it I recommend only attempting this recipe\nif you have a standing mixer. Otherwise you're going to be hand mixing\nfor a very long time and you might just get tired So grab that Kitchenaid and let's get\nstarted! You will need three large egg whites,\n2/3 of a cup plus 2 tablespoons of sugar, 3/4 of a cup of corn\nsyrup, 1 teaspoon of vanilla, a standing mixer with a whisk attachment, and a\ncandy thermometer Beat the egg whites until light and\nfrothy I'm cheating by using some pre-made egg\nwhites If you're doing the same you'll need 6\ntbsp   Note: this is the perfect recipe for\nthose of us who are practicing patience While the mixer is running, slowly pour\nin 2 tablespoons of sugar and beat until soft peaks form This clip is from my Snapchat because,\ncall me lazy, but I didn't want to have to refocus my camera This should give you an idea of how the\nmix should look. In the meantime, grab a medium saucepan and add 1/3 of a\ncup of water, 3/4 of a cup of corn syrup,\nand the remaining 2/3 of a cup of sugar Cook on medium heat until the mixture\nbegins to boil and then turn it up to medium high heat and cook until the\ncandy thermometer reads 240 degrees Stir constantly. This will take about 10\nminutes Take a look at that syrup! Drape a clean\ntowel over half of the mixing bowl and with the mixer on low slowly pour the syrup into the egg white\nmixture. Increase the mixer speed to high and beat for six to eight minutes Remove the towel, add the vanilla and continue to beat for\nanother two to four minutes At this point, you'll have marshmallow\nfluff!

thank you all for your comments and your emails they mean a lot to me and I try to really try to stay on top of them and get back to you and I also try to you know pay attention to what you're asking I have had nothing but just the best comments once in a while I'll get something leave me a little negative it's okay I have promise you I can handle a little negative but my my baking Warriors step right up and just defend me and god bless your hearts for that but I don't mind when someone has something negative to say it doesn't necessarily mean it's cruel cruel I won't tolerate negative positive but I can't handle negative what is it not one of the emails I've had a ton of emails a bunch of them really so I didn't know that marshmallow was such there are so many allergies to it I hate anything clearly so I've had a lot of people ask me about how to make fondant without marshmallows and can I use fluff marshmallow fluff I'm thinking I have never in my life purchased marshmallow marshmallow I buy marshmallow I've never bought that um marshmallow fluff ever so this was my first purchase and I said can you use it I have no idea I I don't know so let's try I can't imagine why you wouldn't so we're gonna try it I've never done this we're gonna play together this is a 7 ounce container so it's probably half a recipe I know that I've seen bigger containers out there just not at the store that I went to so we'll work around that so if if you need more mm maybe just essentially show you how to go doing it and if you're gonna do a lot you know then of course you're gonna adjust it your recipe this is just to see if it can be done I'm gonna say yes and because I don't know what I'm doing I'm gonna fake everything it's gonna work or it's not so the first thing I'm gonna do is I have some water boiling I'm going to take them are you guys familiar with this well it's just already melted marshmallow right I mean let's see I mean yeah I'm gonna stick this in boiling water just to kind of loosen it up a little bit me all right I'm gonna turn actually I'm gonna get it off it off the boil and I'm gonna have feeling I'm feeling it's not gonna let me hold it down so I'm just gonna put it in with this I just want it to get a little soft running really runny is what I'm looking for why I don't know I like working with softer stuff I guess yeah it's softening I can see a little bit of melting going on in the outside how fascinating right all right I'm gonna tell you I don't know I ship what I should have done is to see if this is how it originally starts off you guys who use this maybe you know is that is that the norm for it so this is gonna make a small batch okay I'm alright with that because we're just trying it right but in here is where I would add flour and in here is where I would add food coloring or [Music] come on Maria what's the word I know you know the word flavoring like if you wanted to make a peppermint that would be that would be kind of cool for Christmas right all right I'm gonna say it's done because I don't really know how much how much I okay so for the sake of just measurements for you to that seven ounce container it's kind of interesting I don't know if it's because it got heated but looking at what shrink I don't know if it's good because I've got hated her because I mixed it I don't know the product so I can't say but I'm gonna put in okay so that's not quite a ton I'm gonna put in a hearty cup let's start off with one let's start off with one because I because I just don't know all right I'm going to sift it because remember that is that is a huge key and I just really think I'm gonna need more so um I'll have it I'll have it handy in fact I'll scoop up another cup of flour all right please don't ever use flour in your fondant know how to cook waiting all right so I'm gonna make my will and I'm just gonna pour this in [Music] now I made a video on how to make fondant without using a microwave and it's funny cuz right up into this point and this point on out it's exactly the same this is very stiff it's not it's not as creamy or as runny is how many like so I do think that melting it would be would be beneficial even if you put it in a pot and melt it that way or well for those who have a microwave stick in the microwave for a bit yeah one cup is way more than I made you guys at this point it feels so cool it's just a weird feeling that oh yeah alright definitely don't need a that cup that's a lot in fact let me scoop some away and I'm just gonna start kneading it feels like air it feels just like air and bringing it in as I need it but it's here and it's ready to be used when when I call it to duty this is this part is really cool um I'm not going to make you watch this whole thing although heck it's almost done this went really fast I think the quantity had a huge help to it so I'll just I'm just going to keep going yeah really really interesting stuff I've never I've never used fluff I don't even think I've never tasted fluff Wow yeah okay I would really recommend you guys trying it and I would say portion wise match your wet with your dry so this was not even a cup of not even a cup of the marshmallow fluff and just a little bit of heaping cup of powdered sugar yeah I got it right oh don't do that whatever it feels it feels just like the other stuff yeah measurement measure wise I would I would match so if you got a pound of the fluff use a pound with a um powdered sugar especially if you you know if you are allergic to it then you're definitely going to be wanting to use more I like I said I only saw this one size in this store wow it was great it it is gonna use that one cup won't go finger you guys up alone learning something new I might just have to go buy more marshmallow fluff what has this world come to if you have never tried fondant before but you're going to step out and try one of my fondant recipes would you would you don't know line and let me know that you're you're gonna try it I gotta tell you I'm so proud of how brave you are to just step out cuz it's scary I get it but then you do it you feeling it like this it's like I got this yeah it took the whole Cup go figure right I I don't think I'm gonna put more it's there if you need it but it's kind of good it's got a good feel to it you know it doesn't need more and yes you don't know but I just sifted that don't tell anybody all right so I would say one and a quarter cups for seven axis which is yeah which is about equal each equal portions we've got the stretch that's a good stretch it might be a little a little bit more so when you're stretching it you want to be able to stretch it without it tearing apart could it be could this actually be a short video yeah come on now yeah this is this is Danny I will wash my hands and then I'll help grease them up just because that's what you're supposed to do with fondant and I'll be right back all right short me she's gonna help keep it moist so it doesn't what a treat right you got a loved one this doc hands out this is just like with everything else it's just to get out the air so can you make fondant with marshmallow fluff yeah you can baby this one I think I think so just monitor the powdered sugar depending on you I said it right that said um dependent on you quantities i I didn't give you portions me mainly because I know this was such a small jar or container I've seen them bigger so if you're going to do a cake it you want the bigger one or two of these and then adjust your flour oh so close adjust your powdered sugar as you need and then let it sit a bit let it sit just you know maybe five minutes cover it up you know and then come back to it and see if it's if it's still tacky add more powdered sugar again it will last once it's wrapped it'll last for a month or so really longer I'm saying longer but I don't want to give you false information give this a shot guy just as uh this is a pretty good this is a pretty good deal who knew but if you don't try it you don't know so alright my friends until next time happy baking ah that was fun don't forget to Like and subscribe",

marshmallow cream let's get a look at this cool jar makes delicious fudge here's the ingredients corn syrup sugar water dried egg white natural and artificial flavoring cream of tartar artificial color sodium lauryl sulfate Kraft Foods Chicago Illinois it's a pretty cool jar now you can see the marshmallow product how it's all like crushed down over the years looks like some of the liquid was able to evaporate from the seal because you see we obviously have missing product that kind of you know how marshmallow you can kind of smush down so I think that's what happened over the past fifty four years for ice cream topping fantasy fudge recipe sweet potato puffs for free recipes right Kraft Foods and there you got an address on the top Kraft marshmallow cream this sold for 30 cents that is amazing a product like this these days for this size is probably going to run you three for five dollars and it's gonna come in a plastic container so let's look at the bottom of this here you can actually see the date okay three 865 so there we go 1965 so March 8th 1965 that's what we got on here so you see I put it upside down nothing's moving around in there so let's go ahead and open this thing up now I'm gonna crack it open ah that opened pretty well look at all the dirt and debris that just came out of the seal oh look at that there we go we're still completely sealed that's cool okay so all this stuff that just fell onto my hand that's rust the inside of the lid is all rusty and when I moved it it scraped it off so that's all that was what's gonna look at this yeah look there's a little bit there that I you saw that there was a vacuum it was sealed that's amazing super amazing you heard that little hiss it just made yet you saw how it sucked in right there yeah it was sealed amazing I'm telling you that actually looks delicious don't you think even though it's this old that looks like really yummy caramel candy okay I'm giving this a sniff now yeah you can definitely smell the yummy caramel there's also this really musty odor so we're gonna take a few samples of this after we get it out onto a tray and scoop this thing out onto our tray oh look at that it's still it's really hard okay I just broke into it that doesn't really look like marshmallow anymore you see how it's all in those little pieces it's not really the consistency of marshmallow I guess you could say that's marshmallow ish but this has turned into something else and it's really really sticky like wow that is so sticky it's even stickier than the original product yeah I can't even get that off of the spoon you know what it doesn't matter look look down inside there you can see how I just got all the way to the bottom there's like a whole bunch of caramel down there we try to twist the spoon in there a little more even more of that out of there can you see all the bottom there's like a bunch of caramel way down they're really sticky I'm probably gonna soak this for a while to get it out but we have this here and I'm gonna take a few samples of this and we're gonna put it under a microscope and see if we can get anything interesting on this let me get another sniff ah--this now that I've stirred everything up hmm I can definitely smell the marshmallow but there's like something else in there like rotting what are the ingredients again dried egg white even though it's dry could that be what that nasty is definitely something musty but it's also very sugary hmm I just I just licked it a little bit still tastes just like marshmallow I don't know what could be in this I'm spitting it out cuz there could be any kind of bacteria growing in this I want to spit that out now brand-new container of cotton swabs completely sterile unopened go ahead crack that thing open so we can take a few samples and put them onto these here slides so first we have the top cover where we have some isolated caramel say really thick and gooey you know how to roll this on there okay we got a piece of that gonna go ahead put that onto a slide just that little bit there I can swish that around once I get the actual cover slip on I want to get a sample of inside of this some of that white stuff that we got the stuff that it's pretty much marshmallow but it's kind of falling apart and I want to get some of the stuff here that actually looks like the original or marshmallow product or these days a lot of people call it fluff and they actually put it on sandwiches get to get a sample of that so like falling apart version the kind of normal-looking and the caramel stuff now this doesn't mention caramel does it so I think this caramel actually separated from the marshmallow and that's why we have the kind of gross product so this thing here now because it's really sticky and I want to get it out without messing up the label because this jar I want to keep in my collection because it's actually awesome I'm gonna fill this thing up with water put the seal and the cap back on it early close this thing up put it away for a few months unless let it sit for a few months and maybe we can get a result like my old video called peanut butter salt yeah that was pretty cool let's go ahead get my cover slips we're gonna go ahead and smush this thing down you see it's really really thick I try to avoid pressing a slide with my finger because you know my fingerprint I don't want to get on there but it doesn't matter that my fingerprints on that I'm just going to wipe that down with a lens cleaner and it'll be good as new because we're dealing with a pretty thick product today this is the other one also a very thick product and it needs all my force of my finger and gotta say that's kind of dark I don't think the light's gonna be able to penetrate through that so I might actually have to get another sample but probably not because I can just look at the edge where it's actually thinner like this piece here is softer than the last one and I can just go try to look at the thinner part of this so I have these lens cleaning wipes for my digital camera I can just wipe down the glass with this and it'll be like the fingerprint was never there let's get one close look at up at this first you see what I mean parts of it look completely normal but other parts you see how it kind of looks like chunks of you see how it's like clumping together that's not supposed to be like that but for its age it smells surprisingly good things in glass jars just pretty much last forever I guess if you were in a survival situation I guess you might be able to eat this but you you don't know what kind of bacteria could be lurking in this so I don't want to ingest that I gave it a taste I'm telling you it I think it tastes fine I don't encourage anybody to try anything old but we're gonna get over to the microscope okay we're now looking into the microscope at 100 times this is that caramel looking one see there's lots of fine fine particles let's go ahead and look around in here as you can see we have lots of different things you can see different objects had different depths so that's why I have to keep refocusing because this drop by all means is not smooth there we go we got some pretty dark things in here that would be an air bubble pretty cool looking air bubble - I've noticed every old product like this I open up and try looking at under the microscope it is just about a waste of land it's dead in here it's completely dead I've never found anything actually moving around that was alive in one of these samples not of old food anyways I have found bacteria sometimes but I think it's either dead or dormant okay let's go up a little more this is 250 times zoom again not seeing too much you can go up and look again this is gonna be 1000 times and you see some specimens more magnification is not necessarily better because with this sample it just can't focus it well that's not the camera doing this that is the stuff under the microscope making it all pixel eyes so that's as far as we'll get with this okay this is the sample I was saying you wouldn't really be able to see anything this is 100 times and I was right you really can't see anything because it's too dark it kind of looks like you're just going through space seeing stars because every now and then you're gonna see a little opening that's what those lights are so now we're gonna look at another sample I took to make up for this okay this is a smear of the same thing I put it onto the slide a lot thinner so now we can actually look around a little bit okay we're gonna find an interesting spot here to zoom in even further 250 times that looks different and this is about the best view I can get now yeah 1000 times isn't really gonna help us okay now let's look at the last slide okay this one here looks pretty cool looks like just a big chunk of charcoal with that kind of texture 250 times you can see it looks like a whole bunch of little air bubbles and pockets from the fluff or marshmallow whatever you want to call that stuff that we're looking at thousand times hope this video was interesting thanks for watching", "0RY-T2YRzBE": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] hi friends this is Heidi with kiddos Corral and today I'm going to share a very simple three ingredient recipe with you all for fruit dip now it is that time of year where you can get blueberries strawberries cantaloupe and I love to make this especially when I'm going to have company like I am this weekend my son is actually coming back from the south desert if you guys don't know he's in the military and I wanted to make a few items that were special for when he arrives home so I wanted to show you quickly because I'm making this ahead of time too this is why I really like the recipe because you can make this in a couple days in advance and then you have it ready to eat with your fruit so I'm going to show you guys how I put this together and it is so delicious and my my family just hits this fruit dip and it is devoured so I'm going to show you real quickly how to put this together because I haven't pressed a little bit for time today now the first thing you want to use is a block of cream cheese and you want this to be at room temperature now I put my cream cheese in the microwave just for a few seconds just to ensure that it was soft enough to combine with the rest of my ingredients then you want to use a small jar or in my case it comes in a plastic container now and this is a 7 ounce container of marshmallow cream and you just want to spoon that in on top of and it's easier said than done because marshmallow sticks to everything I love marshmallow cream this looks so good all right let's get all of this out of the container which will take a few minutes well a few seconds till you don't want to waste any I have to get my fingers in there to get it all in there and then you want to add in 1 cup of powdered sugar I'm just going to add that right on top and then I'm going to add just my flat beater paddle to my KitchenAid or you can just use a regular mixer I've even come by if your cream cheese is soft enough if you're willing to put in the effort you don't even need a mixer you can actually just use a wooden spoon and just make sure that you get your ingredients well incorporated together so I am going to turn this on and I'm just going to allow this to whip together to make a dip okay now I have a glass bowl with a lid and I love these bowls I actually got these for Christmas they're made by Pyrex and what makes it awesome is I can this recipe you can make ahead of time and then have it and so I'm just going to spoon all of this dip in here and it makes you generous amount and I'm going to make fruit kabobs that will go with this and basically I'm just going to be putting pineapple strawberries grapes cantaloupe all on skewers and then serve this stick with it and I think it will be really good and it's a nice light cool dessert or snack either way but I'm serving it as a dessert because we're all kind of watching our calories but this way we can still have something that is good and I'm going to get this off with my finger alright and there you go that is it and your fruit dip is ready to be served I think it's personally better if you chew it for a few hours before you serve it but this is so easy and this is really really delicious I hope y'all enjoyed seeing me make fruit dip today I hope you all are having a wonderful Sunday when you're watching this and if you have not subscribed to my channel please do so and give this video a thumbs up and I will be seeing you again soon bye bye [Music] [Applause]", "R-KoBgA7htE": "what up babies i'm back again back again with

marshmallow fluff look this is from last year's easter collection i think it's the same hold on is this hold on y'all let's see oh you okay no no no they're calling it let's get excited it's in a cute

get another one okay that's my game plan but anywho the packaging on this one is cute it's irrelevant but it's cute it's um a cute it's cute it's a bunny in the field it's adorable okay i don't care what nobody say ain't nobody fighting you all right um it's not burnt i think i brought this okay so what i'm gonna do i'm gonna put this on the warmer y'all instead of burning it because i think i burned it yeah i think i burnt this one so i don't even know what it smell like i smell like it so we got fluffy marshmallows creamy vanilla whipped sweet cream with essential oils i smell a little bit of marshmallow and then i smell burnt damn it so yeah that's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna fix it up and i'll be back oh this is this is this is this is tough but this is real life up in here in

get into performance um truthfully it took a minute to liquefy and that's probably because i had burnt and i scorched it um so when i put it on the lamp warmer it did take a minute it took about an hour for it to liquefy um but then after that it was gucci so when i decided to burn it i had let it cool down completely and um nice even pool y'all um i could smell it i could smell it right now

review in ages but hey one is however reviewing marshmallow fluff do you remember probably over one or two months ago now I made a video about Aldi root beer and it was horrible but I said it was from a week where Aldi had a week in there some special buy American products this was also from that week it was cut to be one pound ninety nine and it says the delicious American marshmallow spread so that I guess it's gonna be like a big jar of marshmallow fluff it says you can spread it directly on toast ones or tea cakes as part of it a delicious tasting low-fat breakfast use directly from container on the crackers or in a hot cocoa well we can like mix it with water we can mix it with cream cheese that sounds a bit nasty it says it's low-fat and they're right it is low-fat there's only 0.3 grams of fat in every 100 grams however in each 100 grams there's 49 grams of sugar so nearly half of this is sugar so it's not very healthy but it's not merely a health product is it it also has no cholesterol no cholesterol it's gluten-free yeah quite nice is what I read and you can see it it's not like in the American market one that's been imported it's like they they make in American then like the important for their own label on it yeah there's the nutritional information so what I'm going to do now is go to the kitchen and we're going to make some toast and put this on it and see what it tastes like so here you are in the kitchen got um Aldys cheapest bread white bread not my favorite but it's what we're working with let's put that in the toaster so I can mister D and then we'll apply them wash my life oh well it's toasting let's try the product and see what it's like it's an unboxing sealed for freshness is that what is what that says Wow looks really full right up to the top and it is look at that host it's like white lithium grease if you know what that is then then you know oh look there's a big there's a big gap inside this house cuz I've been it's probably been stored on its side in my cupboard here we go I won't have it on camera but that's not really practical mmm okay this one is quite sure going agility as most like it's more like a small than than a marshmallow yeah it's like it's very sticky like hasn't like if you like poster mushroom it mmm you'll see how sticky it about just sugar it will just stick to everything always yes you can definitely taste that sugar though it's a very specia a messy snack yeah yes so right now I'm just waiting for this toaster to pop maybe I'll speed to severe up in the Edit if if there is another mom it smells quite toasty I just want to capture the bit way boom yay I think that is a nice amount toast on the bread so now we're gonna look at how easy it is to spread I think hopefully it should like melt a bit and then that should like make it stick yeah basically I'm just gonna stick to it it's kind of like bread oh dear oh dear I can't have any parents watch this video now that I've said that it can't melt a bit oh I'm excited to do this yes okay I know I'll go back to the living room and then I'll show you each other on camera jolly good well here goes nothing got got the parental this very good big listening it's not sticky is like the heat from the toast really changes the consistency of the product I'm gonna eat it and tell you what it tastes like going in I hate that by that choice and I'm really clapped wacky because I was trying to eat the past the toast but [Music] where there is the most where there was the most spread because I couldn't taste it that much actually didn't apply a lot I played more after I stopped recording but it wasn't enough to taste it my conclusion is reminds me quite a lot of pop charts Kellogg's pop clubs those are basically like pure sugar that you can put in a toaster but so is this it's something it's probably just one of those novelty snacks which just causes national obesity basically it's okay I think you have to use a sonata T I'd try it as it's nice I'd recommend you try it but don't eat it all the time maybe eat some broccoli or something instead that's all I've got for you today thank you for watching this review of marshmallow fluff I'll see you in the next one thank you for watching", "JET8-nyq-o8": "[Music] sugar-free friends are you ready to have a little fun today i'm carolyn from all day i dream about food and today i'm going to show you how to make sugar-free marshmallows if you've never made your own sugar-free marshmallows you're going to be amazed at how easy the process actually is it only takes a handful of ingredients and it whips up in a matter of moments now you do still need some patience because you have to let them set and then you have to let them dry out overnight however once they're done you have some delicious sugar-free marshmallows to play with now i will tell you that this is a time sensitive process once you start going on it you gotta work pretty quickly so the first thing you want to do is prepare your pan i have here an 8 by 8 inch pan and i'm going to spray a little avocado oil spray into it to help some paper stick to the bottom now i'm going to take some wax paper and press it firmly into the bottom of my pan by putting a little spray in the bottom before i put the paper in it sticks better and now i also need to spray the paper itself now the easiest way to make your marshmallows is in a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment if you don't have this you can do it with a regular hand mixer that works too it's just going to take a little longer so i have here a cup of water and i'm going to put half of it into my stand mixer and then i have two and a half tablespoons here of grass-fed gelatin i am using great lakes gelatin it's the one in the orange can and it works perfectly for these marshmallows so we'll just sprinkle that over our water and let it bloom for a few minutes the next step is to make a hot syrup with the remaining water and some sweetener now i personally like to use two different sweeteners in this because i think it gives the marshmallows the best consistency so i use swerve for half of it and i also use boca sweet for the other half if you can't get boca sweet you can also try allelos or xylitol so we'll add the rest of our water to the pan i'll put in two-thirds cup boca sweet two-thirds cup swerve sweetener then we add an eighth of a teaspoon of cream of tartar this helps the marshmallows puff up and hold their shape and then a little pinch of salt to help offset the sweetness and you just want to whisk everything together and you're going to bring it to a boil so once your mixture is boiling you actually want to test the temperature you can do that with an instant read thermometer like this one or with a candy thermometer that you clip to the side but you basically want the mixture to reach about 235 to 240 and once it does you're ready to go to the next step so once your syrup is at temperature you want to turn your mixer on to low and then you're going to slowly drizzle the syrup in and once you've drizzled in all the syrup you want to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract you could also do peppermint extract if you want okay this is where the fun starts and you gotta work quickly we're going to turn up the speed and we're going to wait for our mixture to become voluminous and white but still liquid one thing i recommend and i hope you can hear me over this is keeping your hand on the bowl and testing the temperature you want it to get to lukewarm and you'll be able to tell on the outside of the bowl okay guys we're almost there not quite but you can see that it is expanded and it's whiter and you want it to kind of not hold stiff peaks but fall in ribbons from away from the beater when it's ready and i think we're good now the point is you don't want it to reach stiff peaks because then you won't be able to spread it in your pan so now you need to work quickly and get it into the pan before it cools and starts to firm up pour it into your pan see how white and thick that is and how it's pouring in okay so you want to spread that in your pan and you can see just as it's starting to cool how much it's starting to thicken up now if by chance you took it a little too far and it starts to firm up in the bowl and you can't spread it there is a rescue you can put it all back in the bowl and set the bowl over a pan of gently simmering water and gently re-warm it stirring pretty consistently until it liquefies again then you can spread it back in your pan so this is where the patience part comes in now you need to let this pan sit for six to eight hours until it firms up when you touch the top it shouldn't be tacky anymore you can see it right now it's pretty tacky and some of it's sticking to my fingers so of course i don't want to wait six to eight hours to finish this video so i made a little half batch yesterday i did it in a loaf pan and i'm going to show you how to finish them off so we'll just take our whole thing of wax paper right out of the pan and now you can cut them up you can just cut them into squares with a sharp knife or you can use something fun like a cookie cutter to get some fun shapes out of them so i'm just going to cut mine into squares with a knife but one thing i recommend is heating the knife up before you do it i heated mine over the flame of my gas stove but you can run it under hot water too it'll just make them cut more smoothly and once you've cut them all up in the shapes that you want to cut them into you want to dust them with powdered sweetener so i have some powdered swerve here i'm just going to dust them all over on all sides okay you guys you can see here i have a lovely sugar-free marshmallow it feels like the real thing but i'm going to tell you this is where the second patient's part comes in they're even better if you separate them all up and leave them exposed to the air overnight they dry out a little and they become even more like real marshmallows but if you're really dying too you're free to go and enjoy some right now tasty and that my friends is how you make your own sugar-free marshmallows now what are you gonna do with them all well i have some ideas for you you can cut them up and put them in keto rocky road fudge you can bake them into my keto mississippi bars you can drop them in hot chocolate which my kids love to do you can dip them in chocolate that's delicious too or you can just eat them on their own for this delicious keto recipe and so many more please check out all day [Music] alldaydreamaboutfood.com", "tiJ0BQJoHnk": "[Music] [Music]", "00b3wyM9XOg": "hey guys it's me Tina Marie with true meaning of irradiance today video is super exciting because y'all I tried this candle out and this candle we need to talk about this candle is some bunny loves you it's so cute some bunny have some money and the bunny is super super cute and this is why I got it coz the packaging like it is super cute can I get a thumbnail with it thumbnail yes oh the packaging is super super cute and it's marshmallow fluff the notes in it is fluffy marshmallows creamy vanilla lips whip whip whip sweet cream and of course yeah let's enjoy oils there's a 14.5 of course candle burn time is 25 to 45 hours in the retail price for this candle is $24.50 yes 24 dollars in 50 cents for this candle is one of the new spring candles the packaging well let's talk about it first because I haven't been talking about it since I started the video packaging is absolutely beautiful y'all like beautiful darling beautiful darling magazine is cute the black top is I don't know I guess is supposed to make it like tie it in with the font size I'm in the font of it but I wish I woulda did a different color background to the font and they would they did a different top that's just my opinion but a lot of people like the top but I think they could have went I almost dropped this bad boy a little bit more spring it did try to mushroom wick but it didn't fully mushroom wick I tried though it try but I wouldn't let it but you do need to trim your wigs just so you guys know you should be doing that all the time anyway well we're gonna talk about this candle as you can see it's like a cream color wax and it had it even wax pool look at that nice in clean I love when candles are clean this candle it does only throw at a 5 I'm gonna throw that out there first it only throws out of 5 but it is a nice scent it is a nice fluffy marshmallow scent like the name says it all it is a fluffy marshmallow you go into the room you get that whiff of marshmallow goodness like you're making a s'mores but you know not the chocolate I was smart but the marshmallow part of the s'mores when you're roasting and toasting marshmallows that's what you get with this candle now it's this candle gooey marshmallow this is gooey marshmallow you remember gooey marshmallow from a couple years back gooey marshmallow is torch marshmallows brown sugar caramel drizzle and gooey marshmallow I still have a little bit still left in here gooey marshmallow is very similar to marshmallow fluff and I know a lot of people was hoping that it y'all it's closed like it's really close even though the notes are a little bit different in the two they are very very similar like these are cousins but very close cousins okay they're almost identical but a little bit different but when they're burning you get gooey marshmallow from this one in my opinion now I they bring out vanilla bean Noel okay that way we can compare that to and the notes in vanilla bean Noel our vanilla bean marshmallow fluff vanilla cake of course essential oils but this gives off more of a musky like a kind of scent even though it's supposed to be fluffy and light it gives off a little bit more muskiness to it so I don't think it's anything like vanilla bean oil in vanilla bean itself this is nothing like vanilla bean so the closest to marshmallow fluff is gooey marshmallow and if you want a gooey marshmallow you weren't able to get your hands on it you can get it now okay and somebody loves you because they are super similar I can't tell a difference like even with gooey marshmallow this has caramel drizzle but I never got caramel drizzle out of mine I just got the toasted marshmallows roasting you know at a campsite and that's when I get out of a fluffy marshmallow or marshmallow fluff I get the same gooey marshmallows just roasting and that's like it that's all it gives if you're a person I want spamming your face in you are not going to get this at all with this candle this is a five this is just marshmallows roasted I mean marshmallows don't have like this strong sit it just doesn't but it throws at that five what I recommend this candle yes if you're somebody that really loved gooey marshmallow you're going to love this candle would I tell you to get a thousand of them no but it would be nice to have two in your collection I'm actually going to get a backup when these go on sale again cuz I don't think three weeks are on sale right now single wicks are on sale today for eight dollars but the three-way candle sale I believe is over so I won't be able to get a backup right now I have to wait to when the full floor set comes out I believe the full floor set comes out Kimbo said March the first if some stories would be will be can I tell today some stores will be releasing it early what I don't like and I think the review and this is about over so yeah certainly by March first this will be in stores definitely worth the pickup definitely worth at least having one in your collection I'm gonna get a backup because it's so similar to gooey marshmallow I want a backup of it so that's the review on that one thing I don't like that's going on right now is Bath and Body Works has the Easter stuff coming out with Tiki Beach or whatever Waikiki Beach coconut Island margarita like these collabs are coming out together and that kind of makes no sense to me at all like how you gonna put me in Easter mood in a tropical mood at the same time I think they're trying to over saturate us at this point and I think it's a little bit too much that's why with that new line all I really got was the mini so the Bora Bora and all that that's all I got was minis and that's all I'm going to keep cuz I actually sold the rest of everything that I bought because it wasn't all that to me and I told y'all I wasn't gonna keep them because they weren't all that but the Bora Bora was my favorite so I kept and everything else that I have full-size already up I didn't repurchase because I already have full sizes of it in a different packaging I think there are overshadowing this line so this line I think it's gonna be a SAS because they're overshadowing it with Easter stuff so it's like either you won't do Easter or you gonna do summer like what is you gonna do you can't do both like I don't understand what Bath & Body Works is doing I think it's terrible marketing whoever came up with oh let's release you sir with beach themed like and then till we play let's feel like we're in the tropics but Easter bunny hop hop like what who who was doing this who's coming up with this it makes no sense I really think they should have came out with Easter cuz Easter is in April go ahead and come out with the Easter stuff let us run Easter mid to end of February through mid part of March then let's bring out our Waikiki Beach coconut in our Bali and all that that's when that should all been released now they're putting them out together and you're telling me I need to go to store and feel like I'm at a beach and feel like it's Easter no hon I that marketing made zero sense and I think that line is not going to do that well because they they're doing the most you you don't do two things at once and I see they're doing it cuz okay it's candles but you're coming out with the candles in this you're coming out with the jellybeans and the chocolate um hand creams you're coming out with the pocket backs as well in the Easter line you're coming out with Easter you know holders for candles you're coming out with all that Easter stuff and then you're gonna say boy wait by this Waikiki Beach coconut candle by the way I smelt it and it gave me such a headache in the store so I didn't end up purchasing it I smelled pineapple colada me and the store's associate smelled it and just was like mmm I did not like any of these new candles that are about to drop in that Pat the like the hook from the Bora Bora line like the passion banana flower all that ice melt all those and none of those sad Tina and none of those spoke to me they actually gave me a headache so all those candles with the pretty packaging the packaging is absolutely beautiful they're all a pass for me I won't be getting them but there's some newer ones that are gonna be coming out like I think it's called funny lime and all that those those look very promising and the notes look very very promising and they have ceramic lids and they're really pretty those scream Tina so I'm going to be probably picking up those whenever they are released but bath & Bodyworks doing two lines that make no sense together at the same time I don't agree with that at all I think Bath & Body Works should have just did one at a time because I am NOT trying to be you know coconut sanding at the same time I'm Easter hunting like it I don't agree with that at all but to each its own so I mean y'all probably like doing both I don't see me buying any of that line with the board board and all that in full size until SAS and that's being honest with you guys I'm not buying it until SAS at all I mean package ins i but it just it doesn't speak to me like honey say could because we're not in that season yet I'm not thinking about it yet but it's something that can wait to SAS I don't think it's something that's gonna run away and disappear no it's gonna be there guys so there's no rush for that line but I'm gonna stop rambling I'm gonna stop rambling they're having a sale right now online on retire fragrances if you'd like a lot of the retired fragrances they're on sale today as well online plus the $8 one wit candles and this will be out soon hey guys you need at least one of these in your collection if you're a gooey marshmallow plan so hope you guys enjoyed this video remember rate comment subscribe I love you guys and I'll see you in the next one bye guys", "PvxBU17KqZc": "hello guys I have a new product to try and this is Suzanne's rice mellow cream it's gluten free vegan non-dairy and I guess this is like a marshmallow cream not your typical marshmallow but the creamy marshmallow stuff you know what I'm talking about or perhaps you don't but we're gonna find out but this is it's something I've actually never bought a non vegan version of I've never bought it before at all I've just bought marshmallows before but I saw this at my local health food store it was like I think 569 for this tub so I thought that's not bad maybe I'll actually give my hand to try at some rice krispie squares now the ingredients brown rice syrup soy protein natural gums and natural flavors and nutrition facts for every 2 tablespoons 40 calories zero fat zero trans sorry zero transfer zero fat zero saturated fat zero cholesterol 5 milligrams of sodium 9 grams of carbohydrates zero fiber 7 grams of sugar zero protein and this is what it says about Suzanne's Suzanne's promise no gluten no animal products no GMOs no fat no cholesterol no refined sugars no corn sweeteners no cane sweeteners no added salt no preservatives no artificial additives okay so store in a cool dry place and let me just read what this says about the product Suzanne's rice mellow cream is the first all-natural and vegan marshmallow cream this great white stuff contains Suzanne's own brown rice syrup as the only sweetener a good for you treat smooth creamy sweet and fluffy the type of dairy treat that's hard to beat use it for s'mores and rice krispies treats as a topping for hot chocolate oh that sounds good over ice cream or at a healthy rice mellow and peanut butter sandwich mmm what you what can you do with this great white stuff okay and then open this up let's see what it looks like so it's got that little plastic protective wrap thing around it I know it hasn't what I'm going to do is make us more with it let's see how that turns out okay so it's not white it's like a cream color and that's okay that's just good expecting white but you know what that's fine and here's that let me just feel the consistency so it's definitely sticky and foamy and you know what that tastes really good it's a sweet treat mmm it I've never tried brown white rice syrup and that's something I think I want to buy okay if that's what it the sweetening is like it's really good so that's convincing me to buy it but it's never really cheap but it is one of the healthier sweeteners although my favorites so far and I think nutritionally is coconut um sugar but okay let me get this on some s'mores I'll be right back alright so my daughter just tried some what do you think it's pretty good yeah I've never bought this stuff this more only bought marshmallows with that s'mores should this okay sure him different spin flip that in the cakes let me get to s'mores here we'll do this one chocolate on yours more chocolate on mine no this one's like we're gonna nuke this okay so as you basically this is what it looks like you put your spoon in and it's like foamy you know this is probably the best way to make or you call it rice krispie squares because it's like spreadable you don't have to melt it as opposed to making it from solid marshmallows we are going to test this with s'mores and see as s'more as that is there we go I'm just gonna scoop let's go scoop this on why I decided to buy this I have no clue it was just oh look at that chocolates nice and melted it was just a different product and I thought hey you know it's vegan it seems like it's well healthier than other things at least and like I said maybe I'll try making some rice krispie squares okay where are you khlo let's try this do something like this here let's meet but a closer look at you guys something like this will satisfy your sweet tooth apparently my dimes look taste it so I'm going to put this in a cool dry place I suppose putting it in the fridge is a bad idea hopefully the chocolates not too hot but I melt I probably melted it slightly too long you don't say yeah well it didn't look like it was melted at first but now look at that yeah vegan see that oh wow it's gonna be hard to buy it I think mmm it's delicious look it's like oozing out compared to a solid marshmallow so maybe I could have put less how do you think clone what's not to like right mm-hmm good sweet it's chocolate boozy mm-hmm it's good but easy I think I definitely put the chocolate chill on didn't look like was melted okay so we're we're sticky or gooey but this is tasty so this is something that works for you so actually for rice krispie squares or other things where you need that got melted kind of marshmallow foam I get this and that's all for now right Club mmm thanks for watching", "pqm9yW3D-GQ": "welcome everyone I'm Deronda with foods 101 today I'm going to show you how to make this fantasy fudge it's a creamy chocolate fudge that you're only going to need six ingredients to make now to get this started you're going to need three cups of sugar two cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips a five ounce can of evaporated milk carnation is my favorite to use when making candies and fudges I've got a stick and a half of unsalted butter you're going to need a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract make sure you use pure vanilla mix all the difference in the world and a seven ounce jar of your marshmallow cream now the fantasy fudge recipe is on the back of this as you can see right here and this is where I'm getting today's recipe so let me show you how we're going to start this cooking before you start making your fudge you want to make sure you line a nine by nine inch baking pan with foil make sure it's draping over the edges that here in my case this is a ten by seven inch pan and it's just going to work just as nicely you're going to pour your hot fudge in here and this is where it's going to cool in a four quart saucepan I've got my butter melting over medium-high heat I'm going to add my sugar and by the way you want to make sure your saucepan is has a really nice heavy bottom to it and I'm going to add the entire five ounce can of evaporated milk now we're going to continue stirring this until it comes to a boil once it comes to a boil I'm going to turn it down to medium heat this should take about three minutes now that the cream the butter and sugar has come to a boil we're going to turn the heat down to medium I'm going to add my candy thermometer you're going to continue stirring and I want this to reach 234 degrees Fahrenheit on my candy thermometer now this should take about five to six minutes you need to continue stirring before and continue stirring after all right Mike a thermometer has reached 234 degrees Fahrenheit as you can see right there and I'm going to immediately take this off the heat now quickly we're going to add the marshmallow cream and I've taken a spatula here I put a little butter on it and I'm going to add it right here into our sugar cream and butter mixture you're going to add the whole seven ounce container of marshmallow cream I want to stir it in just keep stirring and then we're slowly going

pleased so I wanted to put together a quick video on how to make marshmallow fluff I'm a big fan however I'm not a big fan of some of the ingredients that are in fluff corn syrup confectioner's sugar all that sort of thing so I try to incorporate some new ingredients to clean it up a little bit and I think you guys will like it twirls so I hope you like video give the rest of your shot got any questions always post in the comments below and I'll get back with you okay all right hope you guys enjoy you why you", "WzW6bowP_ug": "so today we're gonna learn how to make homemade marshmallow fluff so this recipe is actually pretty simple if you'd like the recipe you can check it out as always on that blog Jackson Capcom I've also noted it here on the show notes so start with 3/4 of a cup of sugar mine looks a little bit kind of tinge Brown because it's a natural sugar you totally don't have to use that it's just what I have on hand so we're gonna get that in the pot you want it all in this Center I'll tell you why in a minute next we're gonna add 3/4 of a cup of light corn syrup there are other sugar types that you can use like invert syrup but they're not common in grocery stores so I wouldn't suggest that for our purposes next we're gonna add a little bit of salt remember salt makes things taste better right we use it in everything not just savory foods add a little bit of water you're gonna want to drizzle it right around the edge careful not to get any of these sugar crystals onto the side of the pot and just give it a nice little stir with your fingers again make sure none of those crystals of sugar get on the side of the pot that's super important okay okay so place it on high heat and very carefully give it a stir you don't want the crystals on the side of the pot because if they cook onto the side they can actually change the structure of the sugar when it gets past 212 degrees okay let's do it very carefully let that go and once it's dissolved just let it go and boil for a few minutes until it reaches about 240 degrees well that's cooking we can start whipping our egg whites if you have cream of tartar go ahead and add a pinch now just start it on low speed until it gets nice and frothy after a few minutes increase that make sure to high speed and let it go until you reach just under soft peaks it should look something like that where it's still kind of coming off the tip that's perfect just like that once the sugar starts boiling you're not going to want to walk away from it because it can be very dangerous so sugar can get passed 212 degrees and once it gets to around 240 Ehsan we're going to take it off I like to call this stuff culinary napalm okay you have to be very very very careful with it because it can burn you and the only way to get it off this either wait till it cools or to just kind of peel it off with your skin so be very careful so we're gonna bring our sugar mixture to the egg whites you don't want to get it right in between where the whip meets the edge of the bowl okay that's the ideal place to get it so turn the mixer back on the high speed and we're gonna maintain that high speed until the entire mixture is the sugar mixture is poured into the egg whites and is fully cooled so you're gonna want to get it right about there see how I'm doing that and just keep it going in a very slow steady stream it's very crucial that you don't go too fast because if you do it can cook the egg whites and basically scramble them and if you get it on the balloon it'll kind of fling too much sugar on the side of the bone it won't actually get in the egg whites so that little tiny space is perfect once we've incorporated all the sugar you want to continue mixing on high speed until the bowl is about a room temperature so cool to the touch just keep touching it keep it on high speed don't be afraid to mix it too long okay egg whites can't over whip once we've added the sugar so at this point I like to add vanilla I have vanilla powder if you have vanilla puree van pase vanilla powder vanilla extract feel free to add any of those and once we're completely cool to the touch you're gonna end up something just like that beautiful homemade marshmallow fluff", "V0D8Ek1RiUk": "[Music] okay today I'm making an orange citrus cake with a delicious orange fluffy marshmallow frosting so to get started I'm using one box of store-bought cake mix and the cake mix I decided to go with is the classic white if you've been watching my videos you know I like to use just the classic white when I'm kind of doing a semi homemade cake so to that I will be adding one tablespoon of lemon zest and this is the zest of a large lemon and one tablespoon of orange zest again that is a large navel orange I'm also going to be using 1 cup of water and I'll also be using 1/3 cup of oil this is an avocado oil vegetable oil works fine you could also sub the water and the oil for milk and butter I'm also going to be using 3 large eggs and I will be adding 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract so now I am going to combine all of the ingredients so while I'm mixing this I just wanted to say this cake recipe is sort of my play on a sunshine cake or it's either a sunshine or golden sunshine cake and when I was a little girl I remember on the back of the Imperial sugar container are not container but the bag of Imperial sugar I used to collect recipes on anything that was on any labels or boxes or bags whatever we bought at the grocery store if there was a recipe on it I clipped it and I specifically remember on the bag of Imperial sugar was a recipe for a sunshine cake and I clipped it don't even ask me where it's at this has been a very long time over 30 years so who knows where that clipping went but I do like citrus and I love orange zest I love lime zest I love lemon zest it's really my favorite so that particular cake I remember that it did call for orange zest so this is sort of my play on a citrus cake or a sunshine cake and this is a lot easier than the recipe so now that everything is combined I am ready to put this in a cake pan but today I'm making cupcakes so if you make this in a cupcake pan you'll want to line it with your little cupcake liners and it definitely will make 24 cupcakes out of this boxed recipe once I have divided all of the cake batter into 24 cupcakes this is ready to be baked in a preheated oven at 325 degrees Fahrenheit for somewhere between 18 to 20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean if you do decide to bake this in a round cake pan or a rectangular baking dish be sure to adjust the cook time according to the cake mix box so it has been 20 minutes and my cupcakes are ready so I'm going to remove them from the oven and I'm going to place the whole cupcake pan on a cooling rack for around 10 minutes and then I will remove the cupcakes the individual cupcakes and place those on the cooling rack just to allow them to cool completely and this may take 20 minutes or 30 minutes but definitely you want to make sure you're working with a cooled cupcake before frosting speaking of frosting now I'm going to make a fluffy marshmallow frosting and I think this frosting is probably one of the easiest things you'll ever make as frostings go so to start off with I will be using 8 ounces of softened salted butter here I only have 4 ounces the other stick is off to the side I'll add that later in my mistake I just added one and started to add the marshmallow fluff but ultimately you'll be working with 8 ounces of softened salted butter I'm going to go ahead and whip this and get it nice and fluffy and I'm also going to add some flavoring you could add a teaspoon of vanilla extract to this you could add strawberry if you were making a strawberry frosting today I'm going to follow the same flavor profile as that orange zest and lemon zest so I'm going to add some orange extract to this but you could definitely add the flavoring of your choice so I am going to add one teaspoon of orange extract and to really give it a nice orange flavor you can also add a teaspoon or two of orange zest and I actually like to do that but I used all the zest in the cake so orange extract will work and I am going to be coloring my frosting today so that's another reason why I left out the orange zest but if you are not going to add any food coloring to make this festive definitely add the zest it works fantastic in this so I'm going to continue creaming the butter and again you definitely want to add two sticks of butter to this I just it was an afterthought so once your butter is creamed then you are going to add 14 ounces each container is 7 ounces I'm adding 2 containers to this you want to add 4 to announces of marshmallow cream or marshmallow fluff however it's labeled at your grocery store sometimes I see it marshmallow fluff but today it says cream on it so I'm going to go ahead and empty out both cans of this marshmallow cream right into the butter by the way when you are working with this marshmallow cream or fluff as they call it it is a very sticky situation so I you you'll want to do the best you can to get every last scraping of this cream right into your bowl and that's another reason why you want to cream your butter first so if you are using an electric mixer the marshmallow cream doesn't stick too bad to the to the connections of the beater by the way take a look at me I've got my electric beater again I found it in the Qura highs okay so here I'm going to add the rest of my butter that I didn't add earlier and I'm just going to mix everything until it is well combined while I'm combining everything together and mixing it well I wanted to mention so the measurement and the amounts of this marshmallow frosting that I'm giving you is definitely going to cover 24 cupcakes if you are spreading it if you use like a butter knife or a spreader to spread on the frosting this is enough that it will definitely cover 24 cupcakes but today I'm going to divide this into three portions I'm going to color them with this natural powder coloring and I'm going to pipe it onto my cupcakes to give it that nice piped look now I'm only going to cover around 1/2 or maybe 3/4 of these cupcakes with this amount but if you want to do the piping on all 24 you'll need to add an extra stick of butter and an extra container of marshmallow fluff to give you a good amount to cover all 24 so that's something to keep in mind okay so here are the food colorings that I'm using and it's basically an all natural powder from like veggies I think the red is from like a beet extract or beet powder so you can use food coloring drops and all I did was separate it into three different portions and all I'm going to do is create this little baking heck and I'm going to use a gallon size ziploc bag as a piping bag and you don't have to pipe this on the cupcakes again I'm only going to cover half of the amount and the rest I'm going to store to frost them tomorrow with another batch of frosting but definitely if you want to cover all 24 with the piping method you'll probably have to add an extra stick of butter and an extra container of marshmallow fluff and if you flavor it add a little more flavoring that's it but I am only going to cover what I can just to give you an idea if you want to do it this way so I've put it in the ziplock bag now I'm going to cut the tip and that is my little easy homemade piping bag it's it's not a secret I this is not groundbreaking I think a lot of people to this but I just wanted to show you what I'm doing today so here comes the hard part I am NOT a professional Baker nor a decorator so you want to apply enough pressure to have a steady stream of this frosting and just go in a circle you can definitely use piping bags and different tips to give it something fancy but this is what I'm doing today just to give you an idea of just a homemade cupcake so here we are [Music] so once your cupcakes are frosted you can dive right in and I wanted to show you the interior of this cupcake and how you can see the flecks of that orange and lemon zest the smell and taste of this cupcake is spring in a desert and guys spring is definitely here I'm in the mood for warmer weather and I'm so ready for blue skies and spring flowers so I hope you give this recipe a try I hope you like it and thanks for watching [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "hFicrO-Way4": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]

consistency just watch you guys next week bye have a fun baboon Wednesday peace out", "gDA5cjX3bow": "Welcome to How To Cook That, I'm Ann Reardon\nand today we're making TEN best recipes using marshmallows ranging from some old favourites\nright through to some brand new inventions that you've never seen before. In this series we've done 10 best Nutella\nand 10 best Peanut Butter and I'll link to those at the end. You can put all your suggestions for the next\n10 Best in the comments below Number 1 we have S'mores Nachos\nStep 1, pour some cream into the bottom of a baking dish and then sprinkle it with a\ngenerous amount of real chocolate chips. I'll put all of the recipe quantities for\nthese on the howtocookthat.net website for you in grams and ounces and cups. Then cover the top of that with marshmallows\nall the way around into the middle. Place that into the oven and keep an eye on\nit. Once the marshmallows have puffed up like\nthis, switch the oven over onto grill so the heat is coming from the top. Once they have browned beautifully on top\nlike that, simply serve with Graham crackers and just scoop and eat that gooey marshmallow\nand dig down to the bottom to get some of that chocolatey goodness on there too. For number 2 you'll need strawberries and\nmarshmallows. Melt the marshmallows in the microwave for\nabout 30 seconds. Dip the end of each strawberry into the marshmallow\nso you get a nice smooth coating on it. Place those down on icing sugar to stop it\nsticking to the paper. Then take a blow torch and toast each one\nuntil it is browned just to your liking. Or if you want to you can take this one step\nfurther ... dip them in the marshmallow and then dip them into chocolate and that works\nwell if you want to keep these for longer rather than just serving and eating them straight\naway. At Number 3 we have 2 ingredient marshmallow\nmilkshakes. All you need for this is marshmallows and\nmilk. Heat that up in the microwave until the marshmallows\nhave melted and whisk really well to combine. You can add a little vanilla to taste if you\nwant - if you don't mind it being a 3 ingredient milkshake instead of 2. Then place that in the freezer for 2 hours. Once it is icy whisk it again to make it smooth\nand you have a beautiful thick, cold refreshing marshmallow milkshake. These taste amazing! For Number 4 let's do the obvious one - rice\ncrispy treats. I'm using rice-bubbles and Cheerios, marshmallows\nand some butter or margarine. Combine the butter and marshmallows and heat\nthem in the microwave until they are melted. Pour in the cereal of your choice and stir,\nstir, keep stirring until that is sticky all over. Now tip that into a lined baking tin and using\na fork to squash it down so you compact it but not too hard - you don't crush it and\nmake crumbs. Then put that in the fridge to set. Once it is set simply slice it into pieces\nand enjoy. That is such an easy recipe. Number 5 is another classic - we've got Rocky\nRoad. For this you'll need marshmallows, peanuts,\ncherries and chocolate. If you're using real chocolate with cocoa\nbutter in it make sure you temper it so that it sets properly (Google Ann Reardon tempering\nif you need more info). Combine the marshmallows with the peanuts\nand the cherries and about 2/3 of the chocolate. Mix them all together. And you can vary what's in this to customize\nit to you to make your own personal Rocky Road. Tip it into a tray and spread it out evenly. Then pour the remaining chocolate over the\ntop and spread it out. This just makes it look good on top and also\ngives a bit more firmness when you're slicing it. Once it is set cut generous slices, and look\nat that - if you wrap those they'll make great gifts for birthdays or Christmas or whatever\nthe occasion! For Number 6... We've got through the classics and I've realised\nthere are not that many recipes using marshmallows, There should be more! So time for some experiments. This one turned out OK but I didn't think\nit was good enough for you guys. So I'm going to scrap that one! Number 6 is Chocolate Marshmallow Heaven -\nthis tastes really good! To make this you'll need cream, egg yolks,\ncocoa powder, sugar, milk egg whites, flour, chocolate and yes marshmallows. Place the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, egg\nyolks, milk and cream into one bowl. And then put your egg whites into another\nbowl. Whip the egg whites on high until you get\nsoft peaks that look like this. And then using the same beaters mix together\nthe other bowl of ingredients until there are no lumps. Add the egg whites and use a spatula to fold\nthem through. You want to do this gently so you don't knock\nall the air out of it. Then add in the marshmallows and chocolate\nchips. Pour that into a baking dish and bake until\nit is hot all the way through but it still has a slight wobble to it when you shake it. Refrigerate it until it is set then slice\nto reveal the rich chocolatey custard-type base, topped with a cake layer and toasted\nmarshmallows on top. Number 7 is No Bake Marshmallow Cheesecake. And for this you'll need chocolate, marshmallows,\ncream cheese, butter, cream, more cream and some plain biscuits (cookies). Crush the biscuits using a food processor\nor put them in a plastic bag and hit them with a rolling pin. Add the melted butter and stir that until\nit is moistened. Pour it into the bottom of a lined container\nand spread out the crumbs squashing them down. Pour the first lot of cream over the chocolate\nand add the marshmallows on top. Now you want to microwave that for 30 seconds,\nstir it up then microwave it again and keep doing that until the marshmallows are dissolved. Microwaves heat unevenly so if you just chuck\nit in for a couple of minutes you're going to end up with burnt spots. Once that is evenly combined just leave it\nto cool down to room temperature. Whip your cream to make soft peaks and then\nwhisk up your cream cheese because you want that to be soft and even as well. Take out about a cup of the chocolate marshmallow\nmixture and pour the rest into your cream cheese and whip it together until you can't\nsee any more white bits. Fold in the whipped cream, oh my goodness\nthis is looking so good, I hope that it sets properly. Pour it into the container and place it into\nthe freezer. After about half and hour it should be firm\nenough on top that you can pour on that spare 1/2 cup of chocolate marshmallow mixture so\nthat it gives a nice glaze on top. And then let that freeze for a few hours so\nit is easy to tip out of the container. Just use the baking paper to help you pull\nit out. Then place it onto a plate or a cake stand. and peel off the baking paper from the outside. Now leave it in the fridge to defrost and\nthen cut generous fluffy cheesecake slices. And yes it is set to a perfect consistency,\nI'm really happy with that and everybody loved the taste of it. At Number 8 we are making up 3-Ingredient\nMarshmallow Icecream, I love how this one turned out too! All you need is marshmallows, cream and milk. Pour everything into a pan over the top of\nyour marshmallows. And then heat it over high heat until those\nmarshmallows are completely melted. Remove it from the heat and leave to cool. Once it's cooled, tip into an ice cream machine\nand churn it. While it's churning take some ice cream cones\nand dip the top in some chocolate, and then into some sprinkles. And leave those to set. Once the ice cream is thick and frozen ... eat\nit by the spoonful, no I mean place it into a piping bag and pipe it into a cone. Now it's time for the Jedd Test!\nooww That is delicious! What does it taste of? Um ... it kinda tastes like a bit strawberry. That's right, do you know what's in it? Marshmallows! Oh! I knew that already It's safe to say he likes it :) Number 9 is Marshmallow Mousse. For this one follow the steps we did for number\n8 but instead of churning it, while it is hot pour it over some chocolate and whisk\nthem together. Place that in the fridge to chill and once\nit is thick but still a bit wobbly in the middle, whip it with electric beaters for\na few minutes until it is thick and airy. Spoon that into glasses, you can add in some\nchopped strawberries if you like and then chill it in the fridge to set. And you get a yummy soft chocolate mousse. If you want a firmer mousse you can just add\nin more marshmallows to your recipe. Now at number 10 ... let's see what happens\nif we bake marshmallows in the oven at a low temperature. Amazingly, they go hard like a honeycomb texture\nthat tastes of marshmallow. They are good but they are a bit rough to\nlook at so let's coat them in chocolate. Let me show you how crispy they are ... See they are really crisp and crunchy and\nthey taste just like candy we have here called Clinkers! So if you like Clinkers you've got to try\nthis one out!

eat this on sandwiches that's just weird okay okay it's seal for my protection oh [Music] okay cause like Fort Knox to get into it okay it's kind of like just solid marshmallow but it's kind of thinner than normal marshmallows it's weird grab a spoonful and have a try it's basically just whipped marshmallow it's sweet it's got a slight vanilla flavor to it that being said I cannot conceive of why anyone would have this on a sandwich it just seems like such an alien concept I could see this being used for a cake filling or maybe squishing together two cookies but I can't see this as a

am currently right now very hungry Jif peanut butter it really doesn't matter the brand but if you do crunchy over creamy I just have to ask why why would you ever do that and you'd most definitely need some marshmallow fluff or else you're probably just gonna make a peanut butter sandwich and what's the point you also need bread of some form country potato all right we're set oh I guess we need some other supplies as well that way you might want to plate and you most definitely need a spreading utensil alright let's get started I should have prepped for this first step one you have to take two slices of bread from the bread slice container and place it on your plate oh my god remember to wrap that stuff back up because you don't want it to get moldy because country potato is amazing it has come to my attention that there aren't that many steps in making a fluff another it has also come to my attention that when you say fluff another over and over again it sounds really stupid alright well now we have to spread this stuff now you may be asking which do I spread first does it even matter of course it matters look inside my peanut butter its pristine there's nothing in there other than peanut butter because you can use peanut butter for a lot of things but look at my fluff you can see specks of peanut butter in there already and that's because what else are you going to use fluff for other than a fluff another never mix stuff into stuff that people are going to use for stuff stuff take that rule and live with it alright take your spreader and get a nice big scoop of peanut butter and spread it all over that piece of bread oh yeah look at this this is years of peanut butter spreading practice coming into this one delicious slice of bread if you have excess on your knife or spreader feel free to spread it on to the other slices of bread because you're gonna use it anyways now this is my second take and I already read the peanut butter onto the slice of bread so you don't have to cover both ends now let's take a huge clump of fluff squeeze that on there it spread strange but once again years of practice I am an expert all right yes perfect now it's like it directly you just made a delicious treat onto your knife so please enjoy that put the lids back on now for the moment of truth place the mostly empty slice of bread directly on top we did it we did it we did it another optional thing is to ask your mom to cut off the crusts and cut it into pieces but I'm a man so I cut off my own crusts all right so you have a delicious sandwich but now you need a delicious drink to go along with it chocolate milk pour that milk into the glass pour that trumpets here also into the glass well now you're ready to serve all right I hope this episode has left you a wiser person and now you can cook for parties all you have to do is make like a hundred sandwiches and a hundred glasses of milk but I mean it's what I expected parties", "FK8fJ5g-SXY": "welcome to

all-purpose flour and here's another cup I'm going to add cocoa powder 1/2 cup a teaspoon of baking soda soda bicarbonate and a half teaspoon of salt and just blend this next I'm going to take brown sugar it's 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 stick of butter it's 8 ounces or 113 grams butter mix this up alright I get that mixed up the better and this sugar get that mixed up I'm gonna scrape it down a bit and we're gonna add one egg and mix it up again alright that eggs mixed in there I'm going to add the flour here and about a third of it at a time I'm gonna add a third of it and mix it in okay I get that first third of flour mixed in I'm going to add a teaspoon of vanilla right there and here is buttermilk we need one cup so I'm going to add a half of it so half a cup right now maybe a little more mix this in and now another part of the flour about a third of it mix okay and the rest of my buttermilk mix okay and the rest of the flour and give this one final mix next what you do is you take a third cup measure that's this yellow little thing here after third cup measure and you want to make six piles on your baking sheet now you want to I would not grease your baking sheet but it's nice if you have some kitchen paper on here I have a Silpat and put these in your 350 degree oven here they are fresh out of the oven and they baked 15 minutes I'm going to let these cool on the pan for one hour next one I want to do is here I have 1 and 1/4 cups of confectioner's sugar or icing sugar I'm going to add 1/8 teaspoon of salt one and a half sticks together just 12 tablespoons that 160 grams and I'm going to mix this up okay that's all mixed up took about two minutes I'm gonna add vanilla one and a half teaspoons and mix this in next we're going to add some marshmallow cream or marshmallow fluff I'm going to add two and 1/2 cups already have one and a half cups in there and here's the last cup that makes two and a half and it's not horribly difficult to measure just stick in there so I kind of just kind of guess at it do the best you can I would guess that's about 380 grams we're gonna mix this up alright this been going about two minutes and what I'm going to do is scrape this off then I'm going to put the bowl I'm going to put it all into the refrigerator for about 35 minutes half hour 35 minutes because it needs to get just a little bit firmer get that better a little bit more cold so it's a more manageable to spread just take a healthy dollop of your marshmallow cream you put it on your cake and put the top on and squeeze it a bit there you have your whoopie pies these are super fantastic and thanks for watching [Music]", "gOHK5f8ac18": "today me and Harry are gonna be taking on the one-pound fluff challenge oh yeah widen sticky the me and Matt

marshmallow cream was invented here in somerville there's a look of real pride in the crowd right now well they're into it you guys don't people eat like uh marshmallow cream and uh like fluffy matters which that sounds good uh i will take that um do you do it with nutella ever yeah yeah all right we're not so different we can we can get along uh somerville is the home of fluff that's yeah that's so cool it was invented here it doesn't say when but uh i assume when uh 13 25 13 25. blackbeard is here fluffy it was a member of the mohawk tribe where there's a druid in the audience that that that that turned lead into fluffy marshmallow cream using the moon uh in a an exhibited uh uh woman um the the uh okay just a couple more things because i don't know i'm fascinated jeff i love history i love somerville somerville uh the first residential phone line this is this is interesting to me the first residential phone line in the united states in 1877 was installed here it went from charles williams jr's house to alexander graham bell's place in boston where he was working on telephonics wow so there was some guy that lived here that was so rich and powerful that as soon as he heard there was a phone being invented you know like whatever equivalent of this like i i was an iphone douche for a while like you go like when's it coming out i want my assistant to stand in line for it like some guy was like what's what's what's alexander graham bell working on in boston it's i don't know it's some kind of thing you can talk to people without being there he's like oh god i

open it to the floor and baby that's not fair baby don't do me that way", "yvg2jib09cE": "hi guys I thought I'd come in here today and show you guys how to make fantasy peanut butter fudge my son wanted some fudge so I thought well okay I'll show you guys how I do it so put the camera down so you can see the pan okay first thing you do is to put in 3/4 of a cup you might want to get a pin so 3/4 of a cup of sliced up butter then you start heating it you want the butter kind of fly step so that it melts a little quicker that's all you don't have to slice it up if you don't want you but it does melt a little quicker makes the whole process a little quicker well that started melt you butter your pan on the inside just a light layer of butter this is not a 13 by 9 sizes that it's more like a 7 by 11 or something like that it's just a smaller smaller than a 13 by 9 because this particular recipe doesn't take a huge pan and know the butters not smoking something on the burner when I cook better last night I guess and you want the pan buttered so it doesn't stick now some people have put like a wax paper or something in there I don't I just butter it and don't use margarine if you can get away with it you can get away from it try to use butter because it makes a better product you can use margarine I'm not saying you can't but it's better with real butter so it's a stick and a half of butter which is 3/4 of a cup you take one of these small cans of evaporated milk it is let's see how many ounces was that here let me dump it out wait don't spill it while I'm looking uh five ounces hey just one of the small cans of evaporated milk I kind of stir that around then heat just a little bit more as you can tell I'm not a big one for health food right myself up help sorry let's not touch the camera to tilt it up and then I put it on hold for a second okay we're still melting the butter with the milk you can add three cups of sugar kind of stir it as you go you know what looks not that it'll really lump up because a minute it starts heating you'll unlock but just makes it for little easier stirring you just add the three cups of sugar to the melting butter and evaporated milk stir it till it's all mixed up see we're gonna let sit there and milk it's got a heat up now I don't put it on high for this because you don't want to burn the milk okay it'll be real careful about burning it because you don't want a burnt flavor on your milk so so stir it I've got it on about medium until all the butters melted and then I'll turn it up some we got we're gonna have to bring this to a full rolling boil okay butters almost melted it doesn't take too long for better to make and breaking up the pieces of butter so they melt a little faster anyway just kind of stir it around you don't have to stir it constantly at this point when it starts boiling you will I mean this fudge would literally takes about 10 minutes that's all it's pretty there's still a little bit of butter that's not melted it's getting there the reason you even have to boil this is so that the sugar breaks down where it's not grainy robach cause you want smooth fudge it still tastes good even if you don't if it's not totally smooth it still tastes good but it's the taste the same but just the texture scrape the sides often you don't want it sticking and then burning okay butters melted we're going to go ahead and turn this up to medium high okay on my stove it's about a six started out with a fourth number four and then I moved it up to six I can start feeling the heat coming on for the bottom of the pan here fudge is super hot it's like it'll stick to you and burn the crap out of you so do keep that in mind keep the handle away from the outside edge and keep children away when you're making it and I know they want fudge and it's cool but if it splashes on them it will burn the heck out of them so definitely want to keep kids and pets away speaking of pets while we're waiting on this to boil there is a Gizzi bear oh sit sit sit sit sit sit pretty can you guys even see her yeah there she is that's Gizzi bear oh yes mama come on a zombie zombie zombie zombies are milk-bones okay so pretty so pretty okay there you go alright I don't know how much of that you caught should be back in here just soon as she finishes eating that you probably here come around me back in here cuz she'll want another one so I go there another one and five four three here she comes two one I got her down them down to a a fine art and they're just a gazing bear hey guys you know they're everything here okay speed up speed up lip no no over here okay yeah he's a cab and you don't know what to do coming hey look what I got here no on the chair on a chair look I got a zombie she starts slinking around when she doesn't know what I want her to do she thinks she's in trouble because she doesn't know which is wrong so I have to let her know she's a good girl so that she knows that she's not in trouble and the thing is she acts like she's being beaten but I have never beat that dog at all she even potty-trained herself you know I didn't have to get on to her of course Queensland healers are really good about potty training so if you guys ever decide to get one you just got to make sure you take them out a lot when they're little the the breed that they are way back when and whatever kind of dogs they come out of I was told to head some dingo in them but I don't know if that's true from Australia because they're else they're called Australian Cattle Dogs as well as clean with some healers it's the same thing anyway not Australian Shepherds that's a different breed anyway something about not wanting to poop in their dens or something so they're super easy to potty train Queensland healers are real easy a potty trained they are however a fairly aggressive dog and they are super loyal they're kind of a one-person dog or a family dog don't with clans and healers though if they get excited like if kids are running around and kids go running by them they might run out there and nip their heels not biting them just grabbing their shoes because that's their breed is they're hitting their a healer okay h ee l ER and so that's their breed and that's it's bred into him to nip the heals of livestock and if a child comes running by them that they don't know maybe maybe I better be more accurate with that they're liable to run out there and want to nip that or heal that child because it's just bred into them for that and I turned it on up to seven because it's not boiling fast enough but I'm not going to take it all the way to high it's just heating up it's getting really hot yeah yeah as soon as this hits a boil we got to boil it for four minutes to break down that sugar and make it smooth your conditioners on I'm sorry it's noisy but it works good not stirring a festival I saw a little brown speck that means I'm gonna turn this down and I'm not really worried about the brown specs but I'd rather not have start oh it's just fixing to start bubbling can you see that it's just now starting I can't stir the bubbles down okay four minutes okay then we boil it for four minutes set your timer it's easier that way and you see how it's a full rolling boil see how it's really both bubbling in there okay we're makin candy so of course it's got a bubble witch's brew and once it starts boiling you have to stir it constantly it's great besides as a stick because this is a milk and butter product sugar so it's going to be sticky if you're not careful now said ten minutes it's like a 15 minute project see how long we've been on 13 minutes is almost 40 sorry it's taking so long guys but I thought maybe you'd want to see the process I went ahead and measured up the sugar and cut up the butter ahead of time and open the can of milk but that was about it now at the end of this if you want to make chocolate fudge just throw in a package of chocolate chips don't add the peanut butter okay if you want to divide it up you would pour some of it into another bowl and add your cocoa instead of chocolate chips or pour a little bit out and add peanut butter instead of chocolate chips or cocoa now you can do it either way you can use chocolate chips or you can use cocoa if you're gonna use cocoa you probably want to use about a quarter of a cup just look at it and see if it's dark enough for you okay because quarter of a cup of cocoa in there's gonna be pretty chocolate this is a really rich dessert guys and we've got one minute and 52 seconds left to boil it and we'll take it off the heat and that's when we add the rest of our ingredients in case I need another spoon you just got to keep it moving so it doesn't burn okay it's not hard it's not it's maybe just a little tedious but it's not hard one minute three seconds now you should already have your marshmallow cream open then you could add about five of those big marshmallows if you want sometimes the Turk that consistency didn't turn out as good as I like so I use the marshmallow cream rather than the marshmallows but and you know that the actual the actual recipe is on the back of that I change it a little bit by putting the peanut butter in it or using cocoa instead of chocolate chips but the three cups of sugar and the milk and the butter is all on the back of that marshmallow cream jar I never can leave a recipe alone I always got to do something with it I wanted to turn the heat off because we only got 14 seconds left and it's going to continue to boil for a minute okay we removed from the heat now what we do we have marshmallow cream now if you move pretty quick you don't have to worry about it getting too stiff on you put it back on the burner for a minute let it warm back up and get softened up and put in a teaspoon of vanilla extract now if you guys want it a variation of this is use the cocoa or the chocolate chips and instead of vanilla extract put in Kahlua you can even put in the bitterness of the whiskey isn't going to be there because it's a very sweet dish now I just put in a couple of big ol spoons and stir now you can put it back on the warm burner at this point if you got gas your burners already cooled down pretty much we just mix it up chop up any lumps the warmth will make the peanut butter milk so as you can see it's starting to come out now you could out you could put the cocoa right in there with it and have like a Hershey's peanut butter type fudge or you can make layers of it if you wish we have scraped down in the corners of the pan to make sure that you get it all okay oh this smells so good all right it's the thing about being the cookies you get to lick the pan right you can beat your kids to it I scraped my pan pretty clean them left in there you can spread it around just make sure it's already starting to crystallize on the top just a little again you can drop it settle it if you wish and that is peanut butter fudge and all we got to do is wait for it to cool and it's done it's about that thick right now oops thick so to go over it it is three cups of sugar one and a half cups of butter a tablespoon our teaspoons gives me of vanilla okay one five ounce can of evaporated milk or if you have a big can just look up your conversion chart and you'll be able to tell and a couple of big spoons of peanut butter and that's it make sure that once the sugar milk and butter come to a boil you boil it for four minutes and stir it constantly and don't let it burn don't turn it up too high and the minute you take it off start adding the the marshmallow cream the peanut butter and the vanilla or chocolate if you prefer chocolate or both if you prefer both and get it all mixed up and get it pour it in the pan because it a cool off pretty quick now I'm gonna put you down here and let you see and if you can see that or not you see it's already crystallizing a little can you see that on the top just wanted to crack a little and that's fine so anyway if you guys would hit the thumbs up share it with your friends you know subscribe if you haven't already subscribed leave a comment down below if you have any variations of your own that you like and y'all come back and see me", "dgxBY7NYvfs": "hey guys it's Gianna and welcome to my youtube channel so I've recently been doing a lot of slime videos so comment down below if you like them and give this video a thumbs up if you like slime and you like slime tutorial so today I'm going to be teaching you how to make a soft-serve fluffy slime and please ignore my desk it's kind of messy that's because I make slime on here and my sister colours on here a lot so without further ado subscribe to my channel give this video a thumbs up and let's get started the ingredients you need are a bowl I'm just using this glass bowl you can use any Bowl but I prefer a glass not plastic because it tends to like stick to plastic more than glass something to mix with or you can use your hands if you really want to get that messy using a spatula I recommend something that is like maybe a rubber or plastic so that it doesn't stick [Music] well you obviously don't have to have this much I'm not going to be using all of these in a video but my husband blue some shaving foam the few different brands I have here at this one out but I also have the Walmart brand here it doesn't really matter they're both based in Spain porn store corn starch or baby powder do it the same thing this just says share cornstarch foaming hand soap you can also use something facial cleanser this is the Walmart brand because it was just cheap and I like the scent so I'm kind of going for a berry scent yes so I got to bury the last thing is some lotion I'm using this Jergens this is also cherry scented so it's kind of a very scent and that's all you need so let's get started pour your glue into your bowl and I've already done this I use about two bottles of glue you can use any desired amount but I use about one cup of glue the next thing you want to do is add your lotion you're probably gonna have to add some more of this at the end to give it more of a better stretch your effect I'm using about a tablespoon of lotion anywhere rollers only you slope and I kind of shake mine up a bit because it's a little watery but that's okay adding about three pumps of this next we're gonna add a shaving cream and you want to add a little bit less because the more sugar you add the more fluffy but then it will be very stiff next you wanna mix this together and you can add more shaving creams with light I probably will because I did not know what and I also forgot to mention in the beginning that you do need an actor they're using is borax laundry detergent liquid starch I dropped contact one solution I prefer we use borax but I know that makes it super stiff so I also have contact lens solution that I might easy I also going to add more in green since it's a little watery [Music] you mix it all together until it's very thick [Music] now if you mix that all together you're gonna want to add your cornstarch or baby powder again it really does not matter whichever one you have lying around that will be good now if you want your mixture to be more thick here's one then you want to add more cornstarch so then just mix this all together I'm going to add a little bit more cornstarch because I want mine to be a little bit more thick and if you're using cornstarch it tends to get chunky yet so you might want to mix it a little bit till it's like not chunky Morrisey and be careful um on this step because the concepts are like fly everywhere it make like a cloud I like to call it so it just makes it slowly until it kind of mixed in now once your make sure is very thick it kind of looks like those like chocolate commercials where they take the chocolate and they go like this then it is trying to add food coloring or whatever else you feel like you need to add more up so I played around with my mixture for quite some time and I just made it pump together a little more and now it's time to add my activator so I'm using contact lens solution this is actually my friends I'm going to return the tears so I'm not going to use that much and if I feel like I'm adding away too much then I'm going to switch over to borax it honestly really does not matter what you use so you just add it in and you want to add this very slowly because if you add too much it will make your slime very hard and then you have to fix that by adding like lotion and that makes it too light stretchy and liquidy so just take it slowly [Music] so it does start to kind of pull away from the pole like this it is time to use your hands to move it and it probably will still be pretty sticky so you just keep adding your activator to remember not to add too much or else it will become very hard [Music] [Music] I think mine's about to be ready I've just been like holding in my hands and it's pretty sticky still so I'm definitely gonna add more activator but I think it's time to pour it out after I get everything off of the spatula so now I'm going to swirl in my slime so this is how you swirl your slime you basically just pull it back and forth and connect it at the top until there are is any lines as you want I typically do this about 20 times [Music] spiral terrible light [Music] that is how you make a marshmallow fluff soft-serve fluffy slime I hope you enjoyed and you can watch after for some more ASMR but subscribe to my channel give this video a thumbs up and I will see you in my next video bye [Music] [Music] [Music]", "hrYUAQc2NE0": "[Music] hello everyone littlefield's here

the best slime ever ever ever ever this is no joke guys this is the best I'm sure you can listen to me all day saying how good this slime is sorry for my long description but again it's true so let's finally get started what you're gonna need for this project is your white PVA glue lots of shaving cream your foaming hand soap your borax solution a bowl and something to stir with start by pouring about this much of your white PVA glue into your bowl and then add a lot of shaving cream [Music] and now what you're gonna do is add seven pumps of your foaming hand soap to your mixture and then what you're gonna do is stir your mixture until it's fully combined now add your slime activator once it stops sticking to the sides knead it with your hands you don't need a lot of slime activator

Now I've had a lot of you ask me if I could\nshow you this version of a whoopie pie because I did make a chocolate version and I figured\nthere's no better time than the present, so, let's get started! The ingredients you'll need to make the actual\npies, the dough, are some all purpose flour, cocoa powder, unsweetened, baking soda, baking\npowder and salt, sugar, an egg, some unsalted butter, ideally you want it softened, mine\nmelted a little because it's been sitting on the stove, buttermilk, some red food coloring\nand you're going to need some vanilla extract. And in just a few minutes once these go into\nthe oven, I'll show you how to make the filling as well. So easy, I've got my oven pre-heated to 350,\nI've got a couple of baking sheets ready with some parchment paper so that we're ready to\nrock and roll, and I'm only making a couple dozen today, but you can, of course, double\nthe recipe and it'll make about 4 dozen, so it's up to you, the problem is if there's\n4 dozen, I will eat them! You get the drift. Ha! I'm going to make mine in my standing mixer,\nfirst thing I'm going to do is I have my paddle attachment hooked on, I've got my butter,\nI have my oven preheating and sometimes what I'll do is I'll put my butter onto my stove\nas my oven preheats and sometimes as you can see it starts to melt a little bit but that's\nfine, it'll be okay. I'm just going to cream these two together\nfor about a minute. Going to add my egg along with just a splash\nof vanilla. Not too much, just a little bit. And I'm going to let that go for just a couple\nof minutes as well, just want to make sure it's well incorporated, you know the egg and\nthe butter and everything is nicely incorporated. Okay, and of course you want to make sure\nto give everything a mix and a stir around the sides with a spatula every minute or so. And then I'm going to add all of the dry ingredients\nat once, and then along with that I'm going to add some buttermilk. Lift this up and then just mix it until you\ncan see you've got a creamy batter and it will be thick but that's what you're looking\nfor. And then at that point I can start adding\nmy food coloring. Now I can start adding my food coloring and\nyou just add enough until you get your desired color, you can also - you don't have to do\nred you can do green for St Patrick's day, you can do purple for Easter, you get it! You got it! I'm just going to keep mixing until it's the\nright red for me and then I will show you what it looks like when it gets there. That looks excellent, just make sure like\nI said you give everything a mix with your spatula just in case there are a few things\nunder there that haven't been incorporated, and then I just take a small ice cream scoop,\nthe equivalent of about a tablespoon and you just make your little mounds and you want\nto make sure you place them a couple inches apart because they do spread. So I'm going to make about two baking sheets\nworth, and then we'll bake them. Okay, last one! I'm just going to pop these in, I've got both\nbaking sheets ready, they'll take about 10 to 12 minutes, you'll know they're done when\nyou touch the top of each one and it kind of springs back, you know they're done, and\nthen as soon as they go in I'm going to clean up and then get going on our filling which\nwe need to do right away! To make the filling you're going to need some\nconfectioners sugar, this is some marshmallow fluff, you'll find it in your regular grocery\nstore near the peanut butter. I've got some unsalted butter that's been\nsoftened at room temperature, I also have a little bit of cream cheese that's also been\nsoftened and some vanilla extract. This is so easy and so simple, the first thing\nI'n going to do is make it in my mixer here, I'm going to take my butter and my cream cheese\nand I'm just going to let that mix for a few seconds just to loosen it up a bit. Alright, just like to get some of that stuff\noff. Let me lower this. I'm going to add pretty much everything else\nat this point, we've got my sugar, my marshmallow fluff, be careful because this is very, very\nsticky, so have patience. Get it all off of here. And a splash of vanilla and now all I'm going\nto do is mix this on medium speed for about two minutes or until it's really lovely. thick and well incorporated. Excellent. Okay, so, get this all off of the beater here. Now a lot of people will go ahead and frost\nthem right now, which you can, but the thing about marshmallow fluff is that, I don't know\nif you can see but it gets really loose so what I like to do is I like to pop this into\na bowl and then place it in the fridge and then what happens is it hardens a little and\nit makes it a lot easier for the filling to stay in the whoopie pie, but if you are not\ngoing to serve them right away, you're going to want to put them in the fridge because\nyou can't keep them at room temperature because the filling will sort of melt and loosen and\nbecome a mess. So what I'm going to do now is cover this,\nI know it looks like a little but it's very rich and sweet so a little goes a long way. I'm going to cover this with some plastic\nwrap and I'm going to stick it in the fridge for about a half an hour or 45 minutes or\nso and then we'll get going on stuffing them. Alright, my little cakes are ready, my frosting\nhas had some time to set, and what I like to do on the serving platter you're going\nto serve them on, go ahead and sprinkle just a little tiny bit of powdered sugar at the\nbottom of your serving platter because it helps them not stick to the serving dish. How many times can I say serving platter? Ha! So I know that each baking sheet has 15 little\ncakes on it so I'm going to go ahead and put a dollop of this frosting on each one, now\nthese are obviously small, because that's jut what I wanted to make - smaller sizes,\nsee? This is what it'll look like. Like that. How adorable! I'm just going to go ahead and pop them on\nthere, if you want to you could absolutely make really big ones, with a big ice cream\nscoop. That would be really cool, I've done it. When I made my chocolate ones, I used a whoopie\npie pan, you don't need it, I find that, to me, to be honest, it's useless because They\ncome out just as well, if not better when you do it this way, so there goes that for\nwhat it's worth, you don't need a special pan to make whoopie pies. Don't they look so cute? Now this one has my name written all over\nit, I can just see it with my own two eyes! So I'm just going to squish - look at that,\nlook how beautiful that filling is, it's not grainy at all because we gave it time to mix\nand then also it's had time to set so it's not running off all over the place, but like\nI mentioned, if you're not going to eat these right away, make sure you store them in the\nfridge, otherwise the filling will soften. Mmm! I love this so much I want to cry! In my opinion they're the perfect size because\nthey're so rich and amazing, I hoe that you give these a try, I promise you they will\nnot disappoint, they are phenomenal and I know you will love them, go to LauraintheKitchen.com\nto get the written recipe, I hope you've enjoyed spending time with me and I'll see you next\ntime!

moldable and shapeable it covers a cake as smooth as possible can be so simple all we're going to need is um a scale and you want to do it on your ounces and make sure that when you put whatever you're going to measure into back to zero so it's back to zero we're going to do 14 ounces of powdered sugar it comes out to be about three and a quarter cups if you don't have a scale but you've got to be really careful to make sure that your sugar is still really fluffy when you're measuring it out by your cups and then all you need is seven ounces of marshmallow fluff and it's that easy so you're gonna take all of the seven ounces of marshmallow fluff and put it directly into your mixer it's really important to do the marshmallow fluff first because if you were to do the powdered sugar it does not completely clump up and a lot of it sticks to the bowl so this just makes it easier it on to about two and you just slowly pour in the powdered sugar and you let the mixture do all the work if you pour the powdered sugar too fast you will have a big puff of powdered sugar all over your kitchen and yourself so you want to be careful not to go too fast in the beginning and you just let it go and it will seem like it is doing nothing and out of nowhere it will just start getting harder and it will turn into the ball okay so it's been going for about three minutes and it's just now starting to get lumpy and pull itself together [Music] okay so it has been mixing for four minutes now and it is almost completely come together as a ball got about another minute and it will be done and it's that simple okay when you're getting close again you have to be really careful because it will make your mixer stop if you're not paying attention and you don't want to burn up your engine of your motor at all so it is that simple and now it's just a matter of just a little bit of kneading and we are back to perfectly easy to pull apart fondant i store it in a ziplock bag um airtight container is the best and it will last for a very long time and when you're done and you pull it all out you will have a one pound four ounce ball of fondant okay so here's my one pound four ounces bag of fondant ready to use you can color it whatever color you want", "mvfkj5ZJvVU": "hey guys it's bro welcome back to my channel today we are making a baking video this video has been very requested every time I'm making a cake using fondant I'm always using my marshmallow fondant recipe and I mentioned that and you all were like bro please make a video showing us how to make your marshmallow fondant cuz you use it all the time for those of you out there who don't know what fondant is it is a very thick icing it has a dough like consistency you can mold it and sculpt it into any shape you'd like just like a play-doh or molding clay it's also often used on fancy extravagantly decorated cakes like wedding cakes or some of the cakes you've seen me make like the Finding Nemo themed cake My Little Pony cake and so many others you can roll it out thin and cover cakes to look very smooth and make cute little characters and designs here is the tea on fondant I made this marshmallow fondant recipe because I don't like the taste of regular fondant I kind of think it's just thick and bland and kind of gross it's just whenever I was at weddings I'd always get a piece of cake and I would peel off the outside fondant and then just eat the cake underneath because I was not a big fan so throughout the years I have been playing with a lot of different fondant recipes and I developed this one the marshmallow fondant recipe you can find it in my very first cookbook the nerdy nummies cookbook on page 37 let's take a look the recipe is so easy but I thought it would be cool to show you how to make it in a video boom there it is this recipe is so easy it only has three ingredients I'm gonna be putting all the ingredients down below ingredients are marshmallows we powdered sugar and water literally you microwave it that's how easy this is you can also die fondant any color so I'm gonna show you how to do that as well it's very very easy and this recipe is delicious the fondant actually tastes like light marshmallow fluff and it's amazing alright let's get started let's make some marshmallow fondant as I mentioned before you only need three ingredients to make marshmallow fondant you'll need six cups of powdered sugar I've just divided it into two bowls to make it a little bit easier to work with one bag of mini marshmallows this is 10 ounces of a bunch of meanies right here and three tablespoons of water step 1 we're gonna pour all of the water over the marshmallows and give them a good coat and then using a spatula mix the marshmallows around you want to make sure that the water is evenly coated over the marshmallows this next part is amazing ready for this take your bowl of marshmallows make sure you've got a heat-safe Bowl we're gonna pop it in the microwave for 3 minutes we're gonna heat the marshmallows and 30-second intervals so heat for 30 then give it a mix heat for another 30 give it a mix 30 mix took a scoop and you can still see the marshmallow lumps so we gotta keep heating until those little lumps are completely smooth so just a few more times so just a couple more lumps just a tip every microwave is different so just keep an eye on it we want the marshmallows to be melted and fully creamy all right one more time give it one more mix and then take this back to the baking station ok and this is what it should look like check that out next up we're gonna sift the powdered sugar this is so it's nice and smooth and there's no big chunks in a big bowl we're gonna sift 3 cups at a time I have 6 cups so I'm just gonna start with 1/2 this is the sifter that I'm using there's a whole bunch of different kinds of these but I really like these ones with the little hand crank so use whatever one you've got at home I'm just using a measuring cup to scoop it in here trying not to be messy then it's obsessive just keep sifting it's really important to do this because it helps separate your powdered sugar it makes it very fine which will make making your fondant very smooth you don't want clumpy bar money smooth fun day ooh see look what's left in there the clumps and chunks you want to toss that we don't want that right clumps and chunks that is my kind of mountain this is sugar Mountain then using a spatula I'm gonna make a little well in the middle of our Bowl sorry Mountain oh sorry just make a little hole here oh this is the fun part we're gonna pour all of the melted marshmallow into the center of the bowl be careful the marshmallow is warm I don't want to burn your fingers before we get in there and mix this together with our hands we're gonna sift in the second half of the powdered sugar right on top I like to break up the measurement because it's a lot of powdered sugar and I like to place the marshmallow right in the middle it makes it easier to mix together it's kind of like making a marshmallow sandwich powdered sugar marshmallow powdered sugar you don't have to do it this way but it makes it a lot easier also powdered sugar is really messy it's light it moves around a lot so if you make a little bit of a mess don't worry that's fine it cleans up really easy wheel oh look what we got left over hard lumps and chunks get out of here everything is in the bowl now roll up those sleeves it's time to get a little bit messy we're gonna be using your hands and knead everything together should take about five minutes keep kneading together until you get a taffy like consistency if your fondant is still sticky add a little bit more powdered sugar you might need to depending on where you live what climate you're in if you're in a more humid place the temperature over the room does matter I like to start kneading this in the bowl because it's very messy look at all of this but as it starts coming together I'll move to the counter this is starting to stick together look at this we've got solet it's a little crumbly this is the perfect time to move to the counter top so I'm just gonna pour the bowl out do-do-do-do-do there we go and then so it won't stick to my hands I'm gonna use little bit of bacon grease you rub up on my hands it's the same thing that you put on your hands when you're dyeing fondant and he's just gonna keep meeting right here on top of the table if it's easier you can work in small amounts like cut it in half like so and work in a smaller amount I love meeting dough's and things that's one of the most relaxing things in the world for me I really enjoy this I get a little workout I get to get my hands messy if your fondant is too dry you can add a little bit of water and if your fondant is too sticky you can add a little bit more powdered sugar whatever you need and as soon as it reaches this consistency it's kind of like a thick taffy but it's not too sticky it's perfect we've made marshmallow fondant it is delicious and it is so fun to work with it's my favorite recipe ever before you have the video I'm going to show you how to color fondant so you could make it any color you'd like this is a lot of fondant so I think I want to make rainbow colors I'm gonna divide this into six pieces three four five six okay not perfectly even but that's okay fun fact fondant is also sensitive to heat so the more you play with it with warm hands as it heats up it becomes softer and more squishy then if you let it sit and cool it will harden to color foam that you're gonna need to use gel color not a water-based color put a little drop just like so then you have some options when it comes to working with your hands you can coat your hands in the thick shortening this grease is great you rub it into your hands just like lotion so that the food coloring doesn't absorb into your skin I like to get around my nails then you can just start working it in this is beautiful it's one of my favorite things to look at it almost looks marbled when you first start mixing the dye in and twist together like this just looks really neat look at that this is so beautiful look at that blue marble I've even seen cakes dye their fondant just a little bit and then wrap the cake so it has that colored marble effect the other option if you don't have any shortening or grease at your house you can use gloves like food safe gloves just put them on like so and continue to work the fondant look at that beautiful and you just keep working the fondant together like a dough until it's evenly combined the colors mixed in now and as you can see this was only one drop and it got to this beautiful vibrant blue color so when dyeing fondant a little bit goes a long way you can see what one drop does so I would start with very little and then work your way up this is beautiful I'm gonna keep dying these ones because I have a cute little project that I want to make with them [Music] [Music] and tada there you have it homemade marshmallow fondant I really hope you guys enjoyed this recipe and enjoyed this video I really wanted to show you how easy this stuff was to make at home not only did we make marshmallow fondant but we dated a bunch of different colors easy-peasy even after you color fondant it's still the perfect texture easy to work with it looks amazing and it tastes great actually tastes like marshmallow fluff it is so good to store fondant if you want to keep it for a later date make sure it's wrapped up nice and tight in a food safe plastic wrap this stuff is so fun even just to play with it and the more you need fondant with your hands the more sticky it will get the more tacky and that's normal so if it gets too tacky and too warm you can just set it down and let it chill for a little bit and it will harden again okay that does it for this video this was so fun please let me know in the comments below if there are any other baking basic videos that you'd like to see or any simple recipes that I haven't gone over on my channel but you would like to know how does one make that alright

I'm here at the chrome Salone shop in Soho and it's turning into autumn which is one of my favorite seasons because all the colors of the leaves are really pretty and if I goes camping that's bonfires and eat s'mores but it's like me you don't get to go camping and have fun fires and eat s'mores then you can recreate the s'mores experience in your own home and I'm going to show you how with my recipe for s'mores cupcakes so all we're going to need to do is based on a smooth recipe which is biscuit marshmallow and chocolate so the first thing we're going to need to do is to make a buttery biscuit base and I have 150 grams of crushed digestive biscuits you can use any kind of biscuit you like graham crackers I like digestive biscuits because they're not too sweet and I have about 55 grams of melted butter and I'm going to pull that in and stir it around along with a little squirt of golden syrup just like no more than a tablespoon healthy and just stir that all around until it's really really well mixed now that's all really well mixed I'm just going to move that out the way and I need to line my paper cases at the bottom with these crumbs so I'm just going to use this scoop this is a good scoop and just put a little scoop at each one a little bit and then I need to flatten these down because otherwise they're going to be super crumbly when I bite into them so I'm just find anything that kind of fits your tin I'm going to use this it's like a quarter cup measure and just press down quite firmly I've got all my biscuit base is done so now it's time to turn my attention to making the cake batter I have a hundred and ten grams of self-raising flour and to that I'm going to add 15 grams of cocoa powder and in there I also have a quarter of a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda and a little pinch of salt as well and that goes in through the sieve and here I have a hundred grams of caster sugar and 25 grams of light soft brown sugar you can use dark soft brown sugar if you like as well most rich flavor so that goes into the bowl and we'll just shuffle that through the sieve just to make sure all the lumps come out sometimes brown sugar is a bit lumpy and you get a nuggets of it and what quite like that sometimes that's done and next I have 140 grams of softened unsalted butter and then two large free-range eggs and then I'm going to put on the mixer and just mix that together for about 60 seconds or a kind of medium speed and once that had had a minute it's time to add the liquid and I've got a tablespoon of whole milk and into that I've mixed about half a tablespoon of treacle I've done that beforehand because it's a bit sticky and I don't want to be faffing about without in the middle of mixing so I've done that already and that's just going to go in as well and once that's in just turn up the speed to a medium again and mix it for about 30 seconds my butter is ready so now it's time to get scooping on top of my buttery biscuit base and because that's taking up a little bit of room in there I'm not going to put quite so much in as I normally would which means I might get a couple of extra out of it but now I'm just going to get scooping and these need to be baked at 170 degrees C for about 20 minutes okay my cakes are out of the oven and they're cooling down so while they're doing that I'm going to get on with making my icing and I'm going to be using marshmallow a meringue icing you might have seen me make it before in some of my other recipes I'm using this because I can pipe it on and it's like marshmallow and I can toast it which is the best bit so I'm going to Pat put all my ingredients into a bowl first I have 90 grams of caster sugar that goes in and one large egg white now remember if you get any yolk in this it's game over for your egg whites so you have to start again so just be very careful when you're separating I have two tablespoons of golden syrup a little dash of vanilla extract a tablespoon of water and lastly a pinch of salt and about an eighth of a teaspoon of cream of tartar and that's going to help stabilize it and I'm going to put it onto a pan of simmering water this is not on its lowest temperature it's slightly higher than that and as soon as it's on I'm going to get whisking with my handy hand risk I'm going to keep whisking for about ten minutes and what this is going to do this in a cook the egg white while at the same time fluffing them up until they're really meringue in marshmallowy I've been doing this for about 10 minutes now it's time to take it off the heat and I'm going to continue stirring it whisking it for about another four or five minutes just to finish it off it is ready it's really thick as volume has increased by about three or four times and it's really mellow and sticky and it's going to be delicious but it's still quite warm as all my cakes so I'm going to just wrap the thing cling film and poke a couple of holes in the top so the steam can escape right my cakes are cool my icing is cool and it's time to get decorating so I'm going to put all of my icing into a large piping bag with a round nozzle this guy nice big fat one so remember what you do just snip the end off put the nozzle right in to the end make sure it's nice and tight and then to avoid any messy accidents turn this tall bit at the top right over and that way you're not going to end up with marshmallow a meringue icing or let your hands and once it's right at the end it's time to get squirting and I'm going to do just a big blob on top of mine so it's more like a marshmallow now all my cakes I set time for the best bit which is the blowtorching now if you don't have a blowtorch you can use grill just get your grill really SuperDuper hot and then stick them under there for a few seconds just until they start to brown on the top but my preferred method of staff is a blowtorch because though torches are cool so I'm going to get this lit now make sure you've got no flammable stuff or loose paper lying around and make sure you don't put your hand in front of it or anything crazy like that let's light this guy and they're all done so anything that remains is to drizzle them with some melted chocolate which I have here and my piping bag so I'm just going to cut the end off you get drizzling and there is the finished small cupcake got great layers here we've got buttery biscuit base that yummy chocolate sponge and that delicious sticky marshmallow a meringue icing and then all that chocolate on top so I better just test it make sure it's alright mmm it's great and that toasted marshmallow really sets the whole thing off and makes it super autumnal I feel like I should be a bonfire hope you have a good time baking this thanks for watching I hope you've enjoyed this video as much as I've enjoyed making these and eating them if you like this video give it the thumbs up and let me know how you get on in the comments box below I'll be back next week with another recipe and in the meantime if you haven't already then don't forget you can subscribe to my channel by clicking on the link at the end see you next week", "wfOtaigLzXM": "hey what's going on guys it's me Joey here from extra eagle and flamey-o gaming since this video is going to be on both so today I am going to be doing something a little bit different now as you can see with all these stuff I'm going to be making a dessert because there's marshmallows and stuff and chocolate bar whoo so in the spirit of summer what we're gonna be making is a s'more fluff type thing so what you need are two jumbo marshmallows one and two so now what you need to do is you need to take this chocolate bar right here this mini one if you don't have mini you could use the regular cheese chocolate bar but only used for little squares so we'll take this obviously so what you're going to do is you're going to break up these chocolate and place them inside the marshmallow like oh shoot like this so do two for each one more here we go so looks like this then do the same thing for this marshmallow and there we go so now that that's right easy to put this to the side and put a marshmallow to the side as well we're going to use this later so if you follow me over here we place this in the microwave for 10 seconds with let me just get paper towels out paper towel over it so the marshmallow doesn't go all over the place it's important to put it in a bowl and knock on a paper plate because the paper plate it gets stuck to it so you place it in for 10 seconds there we go so if you just drag it over here so you're going to notice that it just looks like a paper towel and stuff there we go startup ready let's take this off and it now not ready so it you know when it's ready when it's like all molded and like melted and stuff let's melt the fat again 15 seconds I think you should put it in for 15 seconds just so you know and there we go so you take out this and as you can see it has expanded by lots of much so if you take a look at this there we go so look like that you know about me over back to where we were this way now what you do is use mix this up to look like this so you could get the shot and make sure that the chocolate is it at the bottom so you're trying they're trying to do is you're trying to make it look like a chocolate marshmallow fluff type thing so it looks like this it tastes really good by itself but to top it all off to make it a s'more you have to get graham crackers now in order for it to not be all graham cracker and no more shmellow you need to use a half of one a full one is like this but this is a half so i reckon i recommend using the half moon but you could use a full one if you need to so now

marshmallow fluff slime it is super crunch time to play with and it is a fluffy slime that suppose like marshmallows so we're gonna need a lot of shaving cream so this is our key ingredients so if you don't have shaving cream I can only tell you what you can really swap it out with but I'd use shaving cream I'm mixing tool any mixing tool will do something to stir the slime in or make it in you're gonna need your PVA glue so it gets packed bacon and also you will need your activator which line is super messy but even you can't really enter your activator that you guys use I use concoct excellent so you're gonna want to take your glue and pour it into your bowl and I usually add as much glue as I want the slime to be as the size so if you're adding in a certain amount of glue you're gonna want to have it so it's the same amount as you want your slime to me so the shaving cream will make it a little bit bigger so if you add in a little bit less than you love them that's okay but I'm just gonna add it in about three blocks [Music] so now you don't want to take your shaving cream and I like adding so much shaving cream is like my favorite thing to add in slime because it makes it super fluffy and super nice and soft and it's just really awesome time in your sign so if you guys don't have any shaving cream I don't know what it's up to about with I guess you could use shaving gel but I don't think it would be the exact same thing I think would make it a little bit like stickier and you'd have to activate it a lot more so I'm going to go ahead and stir it in with my glue because that is definitely something you want to do you don't want to accidentally activate the just the shaving cream because it won't activate you need to have the glue up there as well so it's all mixed and you can activate it together and as I said before I used my baking soda and contact solution way and yes so I'm gonna add in two pumps of clear just liquid soap any so cruelly do it just adds in that little scent and it really makes the stretchy I'm not gonna use that scent because I'm gonna add a difference now you're gonna want to add in some lotion or hand cream whatever you guys want to add it makes it stretchy as well just like this so I'm gonna want to mix this in even though this is a different color it will stay very normal and it won't change the color at all [Music] so now I'm just gonna activate it in time left so you guys don't have to watch me activate it so slowly so I added in my baking soda and now I'm activating it with my contact solution and I always like to play with it because it the glue activates itself the more you play with it the less stick you can get so I just gonna go ahead and close it before I show you guys some more here's some ASMR [Music] thank you guys so much for watching and don't forget to Like and subscribe bye", "Ofb4gATwkh0": "hi everyone this is the lighthouse ladies today I'm going to make some homemade fudge I'm gonna

happens in here see if it actually reacts like regular marshmallows if you've seen some of our other videos we've put some small marshmallows put some giant marshmallows in there and they all expand really big and then they shrink down to two much smaller size than they originally start with so let's see what happens with the whole bucket of fluff oh and it's reacting already this might be messy oh it's it's alright it was don't work that's all this is yeah because the other thing you won't have to turn it off didn't block on it yeah so we turned it off because the outlet valve is right at the edge and if it gets to it it's just going to suck suck yeah it's gotta suck marshmallow directly into our pump here no don't fall over it's stuck to the top so we're gonna make a little block for our hose here and we'll cut that part out of the video okay we've create a little block for a valve and we bumped the camera around and and our fluff is kind of deflated so we're gonna see what's me reaction is at this point and let's try it again here we go again I think the air is already released from everything that came out of the top already so I'm gonna drop this camera down on the fly here because it looks like you can't get a very good view of it it's a little mushroom cloud little marshmallow nuclear explosion so it looks like when you buy marshmallow fluff you're buying about 90 years in there it just keeps expanding it's huge little marshmallow avalanche does anyone want to volunteer to come clean our chamber that's your job looks like whipped cream like shaving cream well it's actually filled about 80 or 90% of our chamber is actually a spot in the back that's a little vacant we're down to about 15 percent atmosphere right now so it's all the way to the top is like a solid sheet you can't see but oh it's growing up here now that's breathing so I think we probably would have filled this whole chamber had we had our block on there the first time so we're down at about looks like about 12% atmosphere marshmallow will begin to collapse if we let it go long enough and it's almost too my valve again to the at the top seeping back in there and we don't want to suck that into our into our pump at all so we've got a solid block of marshmallow fluff here there is just a small gap in the back all expanded forward so see where all the air back into water shrink it's actually already completely gone I'll pick up the camera and look inside because it looks like through the lens of the camera you can really only see what's stuck to the glass so this is what we have left it's quite messy and we have to go clean this up now thanks for watching you know to the channel that sucks if you want to see more videos like this please like the video and subscribe below

Is there a difference between the ones you\nmake at home, and the Peeps you just can't resist picking up at the store? Join us as we find out how marshmallows are\nreally made. Americans do love their marshmallows. As a nation, the National Confectioners Association\nsays that around 90 million pounds of marshmallow are sold every year, which is about the same\nweight as 1,286 gray whales. But what exactly is in the sugary treats? According to The American Chemical Society,\nthe ingredients in most marshmallows are pretty much what you'd expect. You have your sugar, corn syrup, modified\ncornstarch, and gelatin. And air is so important to the process that\nit's pretty much an ingredient too, because you can't achieve that pillowy texture without\nit. Some types of marshmallows might also have\nsome coloring or flavoring added, but for the most part, the ingredients are pretty\nsimple. Most of the ingredients in marshmallows are\npretty well-known, but then there's gelatin. According to the American Chemical Society,\ngelatin is important to the process because it's what gives marshmallows that fluffy,\nelastic, squishy texture. Food scientists say that when all the ingredients\nare whipped together, gelatin essentially acts to bind liquid into the mixture. That creates the fluffy foam that becomes\nyour marshmallow, and it also acts to extend the shelf life of the product. Marshmallows can kick around in the cabinet\nfor up to 24 months and still be perfectly fine. \"Most of us consume gelatin everyday. I certainly do.\" As for what gelatin is, here's where things\nget yucky. According to Healthline, gelatin is made by\ncooking collagen, which is the connective tissue found in things like bones, ligaments,\nand skin. So instead of going to waste, those parts\nare boiled to make gelatin. It's high in protein and contains vital amino\nacids, so consider your marshmallows super healthy. According to How Products Are Made, there\nare two types of ingredients that go into making marshmallows, and they are emulsifying\nagents and sweeteners. Sweeteners, like sugar and corn syrup, provide\nthe flavor. Meanwhile, emulsifiers create that distinctive\ntexture. A marshmallow needs to be able to hold its\nshape while still incorporating a lot of air, and emulsifiers are how that happens. The whole marshmallow-making process usually\nstarts by mixing sugar, corn syrup, and water, then bringing it to a boil. The gelatin is added at this point, and after\nthe mixture is strained, it's whipped, a lot. The whipping process is incredibly important,\nand at this point, the mixture will turn foamy and double or triple in size, thanks to air,\nand any additional flavors are added to the mix. Before extrusion was added to the marshmallow-making\nprocess in the 1950s, marshmallow shaping was done by hand. According to The New York Times, \"A century ago, confectioners made marshmallows\nfrom a froth of sugar, starch and gelatin, in a laborious process that involved lots\nof primping. Each candy had to 'sweat' for several hours\nto form its delicate skin, and then it was sprinkled with starch.\" However, candy company executive, Alex Doumak,\ncame up with the idea of treating the goopy, raw marshmallow dough as though it was something\nmore industrial than food, and he ultimately developed the extrusion machine that's still\nused today. Basically, the raw material gets pushed through\nlong tubes and put under extreme pressure. By the time it gets to the end of the machine,\nlong whips of marshmallows have been formed. Those are then sliced into the bite-sized\nchunks we know and love, in a fraction of the time it used to take. This clever method is sometimes dubbed jet-puffed. Pastry chefs across the country are embracing\nthe marshmallow as something sweet and delicious they can put their own spin on. As chef Peter Brett told The Washington Post, \"A homemade marshmallow is really a revelation. [...] It's like magic, simple syrup turning\ninto marshmallow. [...] I always thought marshmallow was something\nthat had to be made in 500-gallon vats in a big factory, something very mysterious.\" \"Remember, marshmallows are really healthy\nso just a small amount of sugar.\" And author Jennifer Reese told NPR, \"[T]hey just taste so much better. They're just more delicious [...] They don't\nturn out to be cheaper [\u2026] but they are better. [...] After you have tasted a sugar-white\nhomemade marshmallow you will not care. Homemade marshmallows are fairy food, pillowy,\nquivering and soft.\" According to Reese, making marshmallows at\nhome isn't particularly difficult, but it's not necessarily cheaper than buying the store-bought\nones. The process is much the same though, as you\nboil your ingredients, whip them into a foam, then let the mixture set. People have been enjoying marshmallows for\na really long time, and it goes all the way back to ancient Egypt. Those original marshmallows were made differently,\nthough. According to ThoughtCo., honey was the original\nsweetener, and it was sap from the marsh-mallow plant that was used to thicken the candies. Marsh-mallow plants were, as their name suggests,\nharvested from alongside large bodies of water. They were used well into the 19th century,\nwhen the sap was removed, cooked with egg whites and sugar, then whipped. These original marshmallow candies were also\nconsidered to be medicinal. According to Medical News Today, there have\nbeen studies that seem to confirm that the root of the marshmallow plant can be used\nto successfully treat coughs, chronic dry mouth, skin irritation, and may also speed\nwound healing. If only modern-day marshmallows had healing\nproperties. Everyone knows that there's nothing quite\nlike a fluffernutter sandwich. So, when it comes to marshmallow fluff, what's\nso different about the recipe? According to the American Chemical Society,\negg whites were previously used in most standard marshmallow recipes, but they've since been\ndropped from most store-bought products. However, egg whites are still used in marshmallow\nfluff, and that's what gives it that extra gooey texture. Marshmallow fluff was actually invented in\nthe 1890s, and it was also originally considered to be medicinal. One company sang its praises as a wrinkle\nremover, and if you can get people to smear marshmallow fluff on their faces, that's some\nbrilliant marketing. But the marshmallow fluff we know and love\ntoday is a little different, and was reportedly developed in 1917 by Archibald Query. It uses just four ingredients, which are dried\negg whites, sugar, corn syrup, and vanilla. So now you know. Check out one of our newest videos right here!

high speed and let it mix and I'll be back to show you when it's finished so as you can see it is nice and light and fluffy and has definitely doubled in size what I'm going to do now is add my icing

what I'm going to be storing it in is just like these little jars you can see that it makes quite a bit so you might need lots of jars if you're going to use jars or you could use just any type of

have done the pre prep also you can use the cups the measuring cup and the measuring spoon to pre measure because it makes it much easier if it's just here and you can buy these and the inexpensive store and they're very useful you need them they are essential okay first turn the heat on start to heat the pan here now we have measured out this goes in the garbage it's been used the evaporated

stirring this okay it's just a candy making ting ah oh yeah the camera girls going like that that's why we say it dude this is making the candy so you have to bring this to the boil the sugar the milk and the vanilla can you see that it's bubbling around the edges now it'll come up a little more and we have to bring it to the boil first that's it this does not take very long hey when you're doing this bring the family around the relatives the friends and start to talk have the talk in the kitchen this is the perfect chance there can you see the bubbles coming now there it comes it's coming - to boil just like that there is boiling okay we're going to turn to heat back to medium high back here we're going to get the timer you get these at the inexpensive store for minutes there it goes okay now you want to keep stirring now notice manfried have the high edge pan here and that's so that they does not boil over and go on to the burner now notice can you see that look at that there it's on medium heat we just want this to boil for to four minutes it does not take long to get there now when you bring the family and the friends around especially the kids you can say hey how's it going into school are you having the fun into sports and you find out a lot because the kitchen is where a lot of people do that due to chatting in that and when you bring their friends and their

not take very long Oh bubbles right up now you got to have the timer for the exact four minutes and remember when you're in the kitchen you want to make certain that you do the measuring accurately and you can learn how they do the measuring on Manfred's a webpage called manfried into kitchen comm where you get all kinds of good recipes and they're very easy to make for the candy like this the fudge you can make the cakes the icing you can make the full meal very easily also there we are how's this going okay we're down we're halfway and disturbing just keep that going yes now you can't leave the room here you can't go off and watch the TV or go anywhere else because this is one of those things that you if you don't it will stick to the bottom and to the sides of the pants and you don't want that you want to make certain that this is well mixed and well boiled together because this is all so delicious so quickly hey we're down that's it we're very close there I always enjoy the fragrance isn't that come into kitchen and this is one thing that will make the family feel very good can you smell that bad their fragrance oh yeah the tech guy and the camera girl they're just sitting here going I can hardly wait yeah sure they are okay we're down dude oh we just got one minute more to go that's how quick this is oh this is a great thing to do you kids you're beginning cook then you cook this is a great thing to do when you got the rainy day on the weekend and or after you come home from the work and you want something to do to relax because working in the kitchen is very relaxing no there's no stress yeah you know this is very very easy to do that's it we're down to okay we just got a few seconds to go here and we'll hear the beep oh look at how that is look at him Owen the fragrance is just excellent okay we're almost there just keep stirring until it's done get it right around the edges make sure that it does not stick through the edges there we are oh yeah now the next thing that we're going to do is we're going to add the peanut butter chips now you can get these at the grocery store or at the market and if you can't find them always go to the people and ask because they have the people that work there and where they know where things are man free to ask all the time oh there it is stop now set it off the heat turn the heat off that is still going to be a little bit warm take the top off the chocolate chips or the chocolate I'm sorry off the peanut butter chips and there they are just pour them in just like that set that to the side now watch that's gonna get very very tick very quickly can you see them melting oh yes look at that oh that's just excellent that's it this melding manfried gonna set it on there just for it a second give a little more heat it doesn't take much there they are look at that they are all melted now here's the trick we're going to add the marshmallows but we do not want the marshmallows to completely melt we want a few of them just so that they're just a little bit oh look at that yes that's it because you don't want the marshmallows to melt all the way in you want a few of them that are still like the marshmallow because it gives a nice flavor and it gives the nice look to the to the fudge hey that's it that's it back here we have pre-prepared the pan you can see why you need to do the pre prep you have to get it ready now be very careful putting this in manfried have to do it this way just for today there we are there we are scrape that around there now do you want to just make sure that this gets put all around the edges just like that oh there okay that will smooth out you can give this to somebody that they can eat that up in the in the oh hey that's enough this just now has to sit to cool that's all you have to do leave it to cool don't put it in the fridge yet just set it back there now look manfried have pre prepared for the example here we are this is going to be very quick here is the finished product that we have already prepared there we are now if necessary you take the knife back here there we are and you just loosen it around the edges when it comes loose oh

"UEXVGNyw7ZY": "today Kevin and I are going to make a fluffernutter Kevin and I have never tried a fluffernutter in our lives and Elizabeth told me that we needed to drive us in that green sir think I like yellow but yeah I mean I don't know how we can go wrong but we've never had this together it's a bread which I have here marshmallow cream and peanut butter nothing happened go ahead wikipedia says this was invented in Rhode Island during the War World War one the name was created by an ad agency as a more effective way to market the sandwich it is particularly popular in New England and has been proposed as the official state sandwich of Massachusetts so what's interesting is it was invented in Rhode Island but Massachusetts wants it to be it doesn't apparently that's what what the media says so what you is you put peanut butter on half of your sandwich [Music] actually it's funny when actually makes Ben averse and --which she she puts the peanut butter on the bread so thin it's a better mix of red wine yeah really I mean it's it's not my idea of a peanut butter sandwich at all but okay so there's no peanut butter and now you put your marshmallow cream on this gosh how do you get it to say it doesn't he wanna oh my god I don't think anymore oh you know anymore yeah but you want to be able to taste it oh you'll be over tons did I want to be able to taste the the fluffer I guess that's the netter the peanut butter what does it makes you fluffy okay so okay oh I didn't get it even you'll be fluffy have to either keep these on them okay so we need to cut this in half good luck my mom I'll cut it with that yeah okay okay Wow cut the corner to corner oh wow you always cut up and down that way that way everybody gets screwed with the top crust I cut corner to corner because normally I'm not sharing a sandwich with you hmm that is so unbelievable you know as much they do that yeah that marshmallow cream Carly hard taste it on mmm oh that tastes so good that reminds me of like oh I've like that when you when you buy these and like a Russell Stover some of course all Russell Stover is enveloped in milk chocolate or dark chocolate or white pastel but this reminds me of that without the chocolate can you imagine what this would taste like if you put chocolate on there to be good that's good it's very good I'm amazed that that marshmallow cream is not stronger and not I mean it makes very sweet anyway but no no I like that Oh better kind of overrun the marshmallow cream the peanut butter peanut butter it's delicious I love the combination oh wait I can touch there I could taste it's just not as strong as I would've thought so you would maybe make your peanut butter a lot thinner I'd make it a lot of less peanut butter okay oh my did you sloppy burger you saw him well I really liked it it's good it's better better oh we won't even get there marshmallow cream peanut butter but but not man I think these letters that's different that's different and other people have said you were repulsive and other people so they logged in so yeah thank you I think moment I've read with me that was gross I'm thinking let's you've tried it you can't something never ever drawn that if you say it sounds gross we've never tried you need to try before you say it sounds good this is sweet though this is like a wait yeah if the manager says apartment you could make it like we use $35 break because that's what we have you could use like pb2 you could even use like I only buy chocolate and I buy the kroger brand which is simple truth you could put the chocolate simple truth powder on here and use that with with the bread and it wouldn't be that many calories at all I think I think do they make it they don't make a lower calorie you would do what mini marshmallow we can taste the same probably different but I'm saying you probably less calories I don't think they make a low-calorie marshmallow cream yeah but the me may make a lower Marcel I don't know I mean if you're eating a fluffernutter trying to get low calorie give me a Portuguese I think you can get lower I think it could be lower but I want if you just switched out the peanut butter with yeah powder right there you're gonna count your calories I have more than in half sandwich truth yeah so Elizabeth thank you so much for being new to us recipe we appreciate it

baby chef here to help me Salo to everyone say hi hi so let's go what are you doing get a medium to large sized saucepan have you heat on medium and chuck in about 125 grams of softened butter salted or unsalted now add about 150 mils of evaporated milk and 1 cup of granulated sugar now stir it want to stir this constantly until the sugar has dissolved and this is starting to boil around the edges alright now you get to the stage where it's starting to bubble around the side and start to boil just keep stirring for about 5 to 7 minutes as this is happening so what'll what will happen once this gets to a complete boil like as you can see the lik will be frothy and we'll have the sort of consistency of warm pudding once it's finished alright that's almost ready you can see what it looks like and the sort of consistency it's getting now just remember to keep stirring it you can use a silicone spatula or something prefer I'm using a whisk because I find that's easier now remove that from the heat as I've just done there and put in 200 grams of chocolate can be milk chocolate or dark oh and two and a half cups of mini marshmallows any flavor it doesn't matter now stir this in until it's all melted and has become one with the mixture now get a cupcake or muffin tin normal size large size mini size that's if you want to make it this way if you just want to make it as regular fudge put it in a 8 by 8 or 10 by 10 square baking tin or something and chuck it in there now just pop these in the fridge for a couple of hours to completely set could take a little long it depends on what your fridge is set to but anywhere between one and a half to three hours should be enough there you go just take them out now these ended up actually only taking about 45 minutes in the fridge so because I've got my fridge set to two degrees most people have their fridges set to about four so if your fridge is set to what mine is 45 minutes should do it but if it's a four degrees or five degrees it will probably take an hour and a half two hours well I hope you like these yeah um so good I'll just take one bite one giant light Oh oh sorry good that's my calorie intake for the month

for today's video we will be turning this shut Puft Marshmallow cream into slime and to be honest this really do look like slime wheres Lincoln will look like it if you know the recipe and can make something like it first off we are going to ask some Elmer's school glue into our Bowl and keep in mind that we will be adding shaving cream later so it will expand its size a lot and then some lotion any kind of lotion will work and you only need two to three pumps of lotion next up is facial wash and same thing only to dirty oh my gosh only two three pumps next we're gonna add some shaving cream into it and this all really depends on how flippin yourself you want the slime to be I don't even know how much added probably have the amount of the glue [Music] [Music] lastly we are going to add about 1 to 2 spoonfuls of cornstarch I recommend to but I only added one here [Music] last but not least I'm going start adding the work my activator and we can really use any kind activator borax contact long solution liquid starch but I don't recommend laundry detergent since it has a smell and color and it doesn't really fit for this type of sign and I know last clip I said that was the last step but no it's this one so just excuse that [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] now this is it for today's video our marshmallow slime that we created I

and they're absolute delicious I'll leave a clickable link at the end of this video to my playlist so all my lovely marshmallow recipes this one is a unique recipe but it's a delicious one because it has my all-time favorite ingredients so join me today as make my version of salted caramel marshmallows now first things first we're going to start by softening up our gelatin mixture so into a mixing bowl that we're going to use the aerator marshmallows we're going to add half a cup of water and three tablespoons of gelatine powder so just sprinkle that on top and we're just going to let that sit there for ten minutes while we work on our sugar mixture okay so walnut gelatin is soaking up all of our water I've got a pot on the stove on a medium to high heat so to that I'm going to add in two cups of sugar hey think of what that's a lot of sugar well honestly that's exactly what marshmallows are they're basically pure sugar so to that sugar I'm going to add a quarter cup of water and lastly two thirds of a cup of glucose syrup or so-called corn syrup so just pour it straight in and as a tip on microwave this glucose syrup for about 30 seconds it just makes a lot easier to pour which makes it obviously easier to work with so basically right now it's just a super matter of stirring it over there's medium to high heat just until the sugar is dissolved no whiskey because we'd only get too much of the syrup on the side there because that can help form crystals but just keep on stirring a giving our stir just until the sugar is completely dissolved and to make life a lot easier I'm going to use a candy thermometer now a candy thermometer I highly recommend it any kitchen they just make life it's so much easier especially for candy type recipes like this they're perfect for marshmallows or any type of sugar mixture that you go into use even chocolate they're also incredibly cheap too you can pick them up for about $15 on eBay or Amazon so we're going for the hardball stage which is a hundred and seventy degrees Fahrenheit and it also works out to about 125 degrees Celsius so just keep on stirring it she was almost as old as you can see and we want to bring this up to a nice simmer so we don't boil it too hard just want to simmer we want to bring it up slowly but it should only take about five minutes okay so as you can see it's simmering away now so I've just turned the temperature down a little bit we don't want to over do it we don't a too hot too fast so this point we're just going to wait for it to come up to the hardball stage and again I should only take a few minutes say about three to four minutes at most but as soon as it reaches our temperature we're going to take it straight off the heat and while it's coming up to the temperature don't forget to check out Todd's kitchen comm as well as my social media which is facebook.com forward slash Todd's kitchen and Instagram as you can see down below that's Thailand double zero seven so please do me a huge favor by following me on my social media where I always put up new and interesting photos and the occasional funny meme okay so as you can see it has just reach the hardball stage so don't cook it any more we don't overdo it so just take it straight off the heat okay so this is where it definitely helps to have a stand mixer but you can use a hand mixer with this that's completely fine because we're going to be mixing this for about ten to twelve minutes so just make sure we're using the whisk attachment of course and as you can see our gelatin is soaked up all that water so it's nice and soft now this is where you need to be incredibly careful because this sugar mixture is incredibly hot so I'm going to have a mix on low to start off with and we just failed to slowly pour in our hot sugar mixture so just slowly put it in and again make sure it's on a low speed while you're doing this have to start off with because of this sugar mixture gets on your skin it will burn pretty bad so make sure this isn't done by an adult at all times and very carefully - so just pour it all in okay so as you can see with the bowl there's going to be some sugar mixture left in just soak it in water and about half an hour so that'll all dissolve that way you don't have to worry about scrape it at all out so circular water and it'll just disappear like magic that's the trick to getting all the sugar mixture back out of your bowl okay so he's your mixtures starting to pick up we're just found to slowly increase the speed and what this is going to do is it's going to cool down the mixture while air I need it at the same time so come to 10 to 12 minute I'm it's going to be just lukewarm so you can even touch it or won't burn you but just over the next two minutes just slowly increase the speed we don't increase it too fast simply because we don't the sugar mixture to splash on us and burn our skin so the longer its bit supporter thicker it gets and after about 10 to 12 minutes you're going to get a nice white fluffy consistency okay so it's almost made 5 minutes and look at this it's already started to come up to a nice buttery consistency it now looks great we still give it another 5 minutes to get to the right temperature and texture [Applause] [Music] okay so as you can see it is now a nice white fluffy consistency next I'm just going to add some vanilla bean paste to or vanilla extract it's just what everyone at hand so that it table should work that or two tablespoons of vanilla extract this is just what people a lot more cuts are trying to say use half the amount then as this is a salted caramel we're going to add some salt let that mix through very well so about a tablespoon of sold as well again that's completely up to you how much you want to use and just let that mix through for about a minute on high [Music] and we're done look at that that is a perfect marshmallow consistency okay so I'm just got a normal baking tray here lined with non-stick baking paper so with our marshmallow mixture we're going to place half in to start off with and just spread it around so it also comes down to the size of your pan so you can have these as thick as you want earth then as you want there really is no limit on how thick you can have them okay so once that's done I'm going to use some caramel now I've done a video before and how to make this stuff from sweetened condensed milk at home it's actually very simple and cheaper and I'll leave a link at the end of this video that you can click on on my video on how to make your own because it's just so much cheaper so with that caramel I'm just going to just place it on top use as little or as much as you like it's up to you I'm just gonna use a whole can waste not whatnot and this stuff is very good yeah we're just going to do the best we can just to spread it out on top of our marshmallow you have to break it up as much as you can so we just want it all over so every time you have a bite you're going to get that lovely caramel taste with a marshmallow like so what this actually smells very very good the caramel is one of my favorite so I cannot describe how good this smells okay so once it's all mixed in like that we're just going to grab the rest of our marshmallow mixture place it on top and you go do this relatively fast because this will start getting pretty sticky pretty fast and to clean up this bowl just do the same that you did with a sugar mixture in the pot just soaking in water it'll easily fix itself up so just going to spread that as best as we can and the thing about this is don't try to make it look neat and tidy and exact you really want that lovely homemade feel by having a nice and messy there's nothing wrong with that you can take the extra time to do it but I just love this type of look so it's incredibly simple very very easy but delicious definitely the best marshmallow you ever got to try and just quickly what's still sticky on top we're just going to sprinkle on powdered sugar and this will just help stop it from being sticky on top and that's it it's that simple so simply leave it at room temperature for about three to four hours to completely set okay so as you can see our marshmallow is nicely set now personally I find the best way to cut up fresh marshmallows is with a pizza roller so just simply cut them into your desired shapes and see how easy that is so much better than using a knife [Music] and just look at how delicious those marshmallows are look at the way the caramel just oozes out of those marshmallows it really doesn't get much better than that no I'm certainly not going to say they're the prettiest marshmallows around but I guarantee they're going to be their tastiest ones around if you love caramel you will love these marshmallows I mean honestly how can you beat caramel you just can't so they're one of those treats you're gonna have now and then but I guarantee when you do it's going to be worth it because they taste simply delicious [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "q8XDHmYfEzU": "what's up guys so who here doesn't know what marshmallow fluff is anybody anybody well okay so my friend Janelle didn't know what marshmallow fluff pause and it's literally the best tasting stuff ever it's that little white stuff yeah I just said that so basically all you need is a marshmallow I got one lonely marshmallow here take it out of the package make sure it's good though and not expired because then it probably tastes really bad so cool here's marshmallow it's better to get the Jumbo ones cuz little ones are really tiny and you're gonna have to match like a bunch of them together so just get just get like one large marshmallow so you kind of like taking marshmallow and use your index finger and your what is this your thumbs dear God and you kind of like put them like that and then you just kind of like need it back and forth between your two fingers and that's pretty much it you just do that for a long time I know yesterday I did it for 45 minutes yeah I have no life and it tastes really good because the longer you do it the softer it gets then you can like pull it apart I guess more it's so good if you want it to get like not all weird and chunky and kind of like sticky feeling you can add some spit a little bit weird but yeah so for any of you you are lame and want to go out and buy the the jar full of it if you get it have to try it with like Lay's potato chips or something because that's pretty good no sounds weird but it's kind of good but if you want to be cool and have nothing else to do on a Friday night like me you can buy some jumbo marshmallows and need them in between your hands and make some marshmallow fluff so yeah see now see it's getting all you like stretched apart now be like cool little snake yep that happened so it rained today you're like monsoon today actually it's like really cool if anybody likes thunderstorms like I do like real thunderstorms like Tennessee thunderstorms like not this late thunderstorms in Ohio we're just kind of like oh it's raining sooo you don't like when you get a Tennessee and you happen to catch a Tennessee thunderstorm it is literally the best thing ever I swear like all the trees or sideways and it was like raining sideways which I've never seen it rain sideways so that's pretty awesome in its own but yeah so let me know if it rained wherever you're watching this because i like to know about weather and i'm a nerd what can I say see what okay so so like hate hate hi oh yeah and then engaged it I think a nuisance pit so yeah so if it tastes a little funky it doesn't taste like is is gonna sound gross if it doesn't taste slimy I'm say he's kind of like like mashed potatoes that aren't mashed without the potato taste so if it's kind of like lumpy there we go that's the word he can add some spit and just like it you don't have to like hock a loogie in it that's where your roommates gonna be like oh my god what is she doing in your room why is she's spinning on things no I just feel like I'm making marshmallow fluff here yeah try some although i don't recommend sharing because God knows where your mouth has been and God knows where your hands and been so i recommend unless you or your significant other you're really close best friend likes to taste your spit and wherever your hands have been I would probably wash my hands before and then Mike you be the only one that needs it I think that's pretty good how long it's been but like I said yeah yesterday I did it like 4 45 minutes cuz i was teaching my friend i do it my shape where you go there's where it's good air is where it's good where it tastes like white chocolate it's weird you know but yeah we just play with it play with your white stuff Oh anyways no no um that's pretty much how you make my fell off enjoy", "QDXCghvRvRU": "hi guys welcome to my Xena today we're gonna be real making marshmallow now let's get started well before we start we have to wash our hands then we have seven jumbo marshmallows right put them in you put them in the microwave and microwave you know see as you can see the marshmallows would be a little bit fluffy like this and you mushroom with the mushy thing so it will be sticking to your utensil so you have to use a fork to get the marshmallow ah so now we need to add a cheesy bit of a now which is one option whoa okay so now you can get your salt and you just put it on this side works this wrinkled side put one sprinkle on your hand and you pinch the salt into the thing and that's only one pinch to even out the sugar so now just have to stir it with a fork so that is just the fork it's sticky sticky so now let's stir it all the way when it's not brown anymore and it's back to white you have your marshmallows let's if you want to like squeeze it in between you have to get so get get a spatula back and you put the marshmallow cream into your bag you cut a hole into your bag and you squeeze it out between one of the cookies hope you like this marshmallow cream this is my version I made a joke I didn't copy it from any recipe bye-bye have a good day and this is mr.", "Vymxpxo-1xc": "[Music] hi I'm Verna's welcome to local teacher recipes and having fun I never knew making marshmallows was such a simple and easy process this is the first time I've tried this recipe myself and let me tell you they are foolproof so let me show you the little batch that I made and I'll do a taste test too now look at that these are my marshmallows little baby pink ones beautiful and let me do a taste tester oh my god marshmallows so easy anyway since we are standing in my kitchen let's get cookin so here are the things we'll need we will need some gelatin powder three tablespoons of it 1/2 a cup of any sweetener of your choice vanilla extract or you can use any other kind of extract banana whatever one cup of water which will be divided into two parts and this is food coloring this is where I've made my marshmallows pink so I used red food coloring it's completely optional they'll look good in white also so let's begin with the recipe you take a bowl and you put half a cup of water into it now it's not on the burner I have just the cameras lying there so I've just placed it there and you add you sprinkle three tablespoons of gelatin powder on it now what will happen is that you will leave this to rest for about five to ten minutes and gelatin powder has the capability to soak in the water and become a gooey thick consistency so that's what we are doing with this is our first part now the other half of a cup of water you take a saucepan and you put on your stove and you pour in your water onto the stovetop take your half cup of sweetener I've use a little it's up to you you want it sweeter but I thought half cup was more than enough okay now give this a stir and begin to stir it such that your sweetener gets dissolved and not only stir it we want this water to come to a boiling consistency completely bubbling up like over the boiling point so it's going to can you see now it's been a bit of a while and the water is piping hot and bubbling and this is where we want it to be so that is the second part of it so hot water with your sweetener boiling hot now this is the gelatine after ten minutes and can you see it's all got gooey and that's exactly the way we wanted it to be you can give it a little bit of a mix but you are going to be using a mix a stand mixer blender or a food processor so don't worry about mixing it too much I'm using a hand mixer and it's going to be eight to ten minutes of mixing the whole entire mixture together so that's the little tedious part so I put on my hand mixer and start blending it sorry for the noise but I have to show you how it's done and you just give it a little bit of a mix and you begin pouring in your hot water and sweetener mixture into this carry on with the mixing between using the food processor then just graphics dropped all the hot water mixture in and put on your food processor and what we are looking for in this mixture stick feet like he be with egg whites now after mixing it a little bit I'm adding some vanilla extract 1 teaspoon or vanilla is there's never too much of vanilla even up to 2 teaspoons so you begin with the mixing to what point the consistency should meet and this is after about 8 7 8 minutes of mixing it's still a runny consistency we still need to mix it a little more so this is now after about 10 to 12 minutes now look at the mixture can you see it's not falling off the blades and that is how we won't want it ok so now what we're doing is we are adding this is completely optional I wanted lovely pink marshmallows so I have added 3/4 drops of red food color so that look at that how beautiful the color is changing into a few you think I thought they'd look really pretty as pink marshmallows and can you see how thick it is I'm showing you the consistency okay now I've taken a rectangle glass dish and I've lined it with baking paper and we are going to be pouring it in there is no baking in this it's going to be kept in the fridge after we pour it in I'm sprinkling a bit of a sweetener at the base of the baking paper that's it just that so that the marshmallow when it's setting picked up a bit of the granules of the sweetener okay now we are going to pour in the mixture into the glass dish which has been lined with the paper and this is the part which probably is a little bit cumbersome you have to start leveling it out such that it becomes like how you do with a cake batter but you'll need to do it a little bit more I'm going to show you how take a spatula and do it and that's how it will become easy for you so see this is the way I've spread it into end into my glass dish and I want to show you a little trick in case you feel it's not settling down just take your spatula and put some little hot water on your spatula and then again begin to level it out it just helps because it starts giving the smoother loop don't worry if there are little bubbles in it that's what I'm doing now I'm just dipping it in a little bit of hot water and that way it just starts levelling out even better okay so it's ready for the fridge and now I've taken it out of the fridge it went into the fridge for two hours or more you can keep it up two to three hours just so that it firms up and now we are about to cut our marshmallows just look at that take a sharp knife and cut it to whatever size you like I'm making really big ones I thought since this is the first time I'm making it the bigger the better and how beautifully they set in the fridge and look at that that's my first marshmallow spongy much better than the store bought one and gelatin is even good for your health it's very good for your bones I hope you like my recipe and do subscribe to my channel bye then enjoy [Music]", "rSOvk31ssBw": "all right guys we're back nader's food review today i am very excited we are having almost like a dessert sandwich we have forgive me we have

going to be a kid and cut it into squares okay there you go the consistent so far with the consistency or your kind of turned off by it yeah moga you get a little bit of a stuffy nose yeah I have a

strawberry jam but it's not terrible okay good it's not like a tamale you're eating the entrails of us no no it's not that yeah it's basically candy is what it is and when my kids ask for something like this basically they're asking that's your dessert right there fluffernutter sandwich said that was something he would pack in a school lunch I don't think so nobody's it just I mean maybe maybe on a rare occasion as a tree but we go she's not even going for a second fight I think she's done do I have it all over my face yeah my name is probably a little mysterious it's very messy yeah and I

we are partners and slime I am slime master and I important and we are here to teach you how to make marshmallow this slime has a light and fluffy consistency which is where it got its name this slime is not edible however the components you will need are a bowl something to mix with foaming hand soap white Elmer's school glue and liquid starch add some glue into a bowl then add a few squirts of your foaming hand soap then add a few more squirts and just add a couple more squirts until you get consistency of a thick shaving cream now add your liquid starch little by little until it looks a little something like this then knead if your marshmallow fluff is too sticky then add more liquid starch and you're done remember to keep your fluff in an airtight container and enjoy see you next time on partners and slime", "6rTIUUiiN7U": "you can't go camping without s'mores it's probably the biggest temptation for me when camping this camp trip I came prepared with a batch of Kido s'mores and today I'm going to show you how to make those Kido graham crackers and marshmallows these s'mores taste like the real deal they're easy to make and they can be made days ahead of time so follow along so you can enjoy s'mores too [Music] or the graham crackers you want to add two and a half cups of almond flour to a food processor then 1/3 cup of coconut flour and a half a cup of a canto monk fruit also you need a quarter cup of swerve one teaspoon of baking powder and xanthan gum and a half a teaspoon of baking soda also the salt too then you're going to pulse that a couple of times in the food processor to combine everything up then you're going to add three ounces of cold butter cut into cubes and you just give it a good pulse again until it forms coarse crumbles [Music] then add three tablespoons of heavy cream and a teaspoon of vanilla too then pulls it all again until it forms a dough ball [Music] but there's a nice dough ball right there press the dough out onto parchment paper until it forms a one-inch thick disc then refrigerate it for 30 minutes [Music] [Music] next you're gonna roll the dough out until it's about an eighth of an inch thick I find it easiest to roll if you have a piece of parchment paper on top of the dough using a pizza cutter cut the dough into one and a half inch squares you could also use a knife for this too but I just find that pizza cutters a lot easier [Music] [Music] then with a fork just prick each square about three or four times this is gonna allow for air to escape when it's baking then just pop it on a baking tray and bake at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes after the crackers have cooled running knife along the scored edges to break them off into individual crackers cheeto graham crackers can be stored at room temperature in an airtight container for about a couple of weeks Torgo marshmallows start with three tablespoons of gelatin and dissolve it in a half a cup of cold water plus a tablespoon of vanilla whisk it all together until it looks like applesauce and then you're gonna set it aside so you work on the rest of the marshmallow ingredients using a saucepan you want to add a cup of water and a cup of confectioner's swerve and also a quarter teaspoon of salt whisk it all together until it's combined and you're going to cook this over medium-high heat until it reaches a temperature of 240 degrees on a thermometer this will take about 10 minutes to achieve once you've reached softball stage on the thermometer pour it into the gelatin mixture and then use an electric mixture and beat it until you have a creamy marshmallow consistency this is probably gonna take about 7 to 10 minutes of beating but you'll know it's done because it's gonna be marshmallow creamy it can look like marshmallow cream then you're gonna pour this into a square baking dish that's lined with parchment paper and spread it out with a spatula you're also gonna let it cool for about four hours uncovered at room temperature and once it's ready just cut it out into its desired shape I like to use little squares and then you're gonna dust each little square with confectioner's swerve these keto marshmallows can

bowl and sprinkle in two packets of gelatin give it a quick stir for 1/2 cup of cold water in a small pot and add 2 cups of granulated sugar on high heat cook the sugar water until it comes to a boil give it a stir and then turn the heat down to low simmer for 10 to 15 minutes you're aiming for about 240 degrees Celsius which is called the softball stage in candy making if you drop some of the syrup into cold water it will form a soft ball on your fingers but it's not that important as long as your syrup is simmered for about 10 minutes you're probably fine take your syrup off the heat while your circles down a bit line an 8 by 8 inch pan with parchment paper you could also use plastic wrap or aluminum foil add 1 tablespoon of cornstarch to 4 tablespoons of icing sugar and mix grease the bottom of the pan with a bit of vegetable oil then grease all the other sides of the pan sprinkle some of the sugar cornstarch mixture onto the parchment paper and tap the pan to evenly distribute it pour the syrup into the bowl with the gelatin and beat it with a hand blender for 5 minutes until it's white and second this is a lot like beating egg whites add one teaspoon of vanilla or any other flavoring or coloring you want to use beat for another seven to eight minutes until the mixture is tripled in volume and almost able to stand up on its own oil your rubber spatula because the marshmallow fluff is going to be super sticky scrape the marshmallow fluff into the pan and smooth at the top the best you can use the sieve to dust the top with some of the sugar cornstarch mixture give it a couple taps - even at the top then set it aside for a few hours to let it set 6 to 8 hours is good lift the marshmallow out using the size of the parchment paper and put it down on a cutting board covered with another piece of parchment paper peel the parchment paper off the sides dust your surface with sugar cornstarch flip your marshmallow out and dust the top with more sugar cornstarch oil your knife little and dust it with sugar cornstarch then carefully Saul your marshmallow into strips roll the strip's around in sugar cornstarch and then cut them into squares you may have to clean and riyo your knife in between cuts dust each marshmallow and more sugar cornstarch to prevent them from sticking and there you have your finished marshmallows they're so fluffy soft and squishy and exactly like the real thing but fresher and yummier tasting now let's watch some marshmallows in slow motion boy that's how I make marshmallows oh oh I guess I have to eat that one ok here

loyal subscribers today I'm gonna be doing a review of this Nutella and marshmallow fluff sandwich now it's already like half way eaten because about half way through eating the sandwich I was like I should do a food review on this and let me tell you this smear is because this piece of Nutella hit the paper so we're gonna we're going to take a bite - it but I'm gonna tell you how good the sandwiches out of 10 [Music] okay very sticky let's go for another bite [Music] alright let me tell you this much this is freaking amazing now I'm not sure but I'm pretty sure this will be better than peanut butter [Music] but anyways it's it's pretty good you when when you first bite you feel the texture of the bread don't really taste it though and then you get hit with that uh marshmallow fluff and the marshmallow fluff is just the gore glorious the marshmallow fluff is very sweet very light very creamy so that's nice and then after you chew a little bit you get that marshmallow fluff mixed in with the Nutella and then the telehealth at hazelnut creamy nutty flavor you know chocolaty a little bit so you get you get the UM the marshmallow fluff and then Nutella but the texture of the bread all mixed together if you have Nutella marshmallow flying around some bread this sandwich is possibly one of the best sandwiches you can make on this planet because let me tell you this much it is so good 10 out of 10", "8_MviJEjydo": "hey everyone got another action-packed video for you with another review of one of my food items that have brought right the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to put the toaster down because it's not going to be a lot of good if we don't have any toast so all the toast is cooking i'm going to show you what we're going to have on it and the product that we are going to have on our toast tonight is this marshmallow fluff what i would call the real McCoy now i know that in England you can get some variations of this of the more continental versions in some of our supermarkets but this is what I call the real McCoy from the United States now I first saw this particular product about 20 months ago on a YouTube advert well it was a YouTube video it was where some American kid decided to put a jar of fluff in a microwave to see what would happen to be honest not a lot happen really and we'll just have a look at the nutrition facts because they are very very interesting to read in fact you might be able to read that only 40 calories per serving it says here that we can that serve in size is two tablespoons servings per container is about 18 and look at the fat total fat Neil trans fat Neil sodium five milligrams total by carbohydrate ten percent sugar six percent protein 0 0 grams and it's even more interesting when you look at the-- when we can actually find the ingredients if we can find the ingredients just hold on because the toast is ready and our here we go the ingredients contains corn syrup sugar egg whites and vanilla I've got that spelling right anyway my toast is ready so if we get that on put it on to their and unfortunately I'm afraid I'm not going to be able to do the next bit so I'm afraid you're going to have to look at the sky for a moment cuz i know some people got annoyed by plunging the screen into total darkness but just to show you i'm going to pull the sealant off oh my god lee and in fact if i get to come up up i will be able to show you what i can see there we go there's the lid and it's all quite strange really really quite strange it's like em it's like sort of it is exactly how I thought it would look like looks like the inside of tea cakes where you get in there tea cakes in England think it's truffles tea cakes so right there not be about the bottom otherwise the time already well cold so there we go we'll look at the sky again just for a moment we'll see how it comes into the yeah that's not too bad actually spreading was and will now show you the ceremonial spreading there we go I just nurse it up there yeah this is really fun something this is there we go we've got a bit spread onto there oh i forgot to say i forgot to say that this is the vanilla flavor so there we go we'll go over here and we'll sit down like we normally do Admiral eat it bit by bit okay so here we go first bit for my first ever taste of marshmallow marshmallow fluff from the United States hmm sweet but not overly that empowering which I was kind of expecting it's being much much sweeter than than that I suppose hmm but yeah definitely a marshmallow zing to it hmm yeah yeah it's nice even got some on the ipod touches I'm filming this yeah yeah it definitely goes with the bread I never thought I never thought I'd ever be eating bread math mellow while toast and marshmallow on the same thing but yeah definitely works don't know about sandwiches always imagined doing I can imagine knowing like something up Baked Alaska or something with it don't know whether it would work but just random thoughts later hmm nearly done with this laughs bet yeah that were very very nice not overpowering it just goes together just gives the toast a little bit of a kick which is all the merrier hmm absolutely well thank you very much for watching and see you later", "vVmgxo_srPA": "hello again ladies I'm going to do a review this is a first impressions review I want the Heritage hydration marshmallow fluff cream and this is what it looks like the label and this stuff smells like toasted marshmallows it smells so good and this is I've been using this off and on during the week as a daily moisturizing I got it a couple of days ago it's really light and this is the consistency of it but it is a good moisturizer now this is my first time today using it on my hair and if you would look in my video when I first put this on my hair and like I said before I tend to overlook things and not really pay attention to the description of it so much especially when it smells really good so when I first put this on my hair I thought it was 11 and I looked at the description again and it says marshmallow fluff cream softened condition and help beat frizz with this custard light hair cream made with marshmallow root for extra slip also made with rich butters to help lock in moisture apply to wet hair and finger comb for finger comb through for easy to tingling or apply as a daily moisturizer great foot two strand twists may be used as a hair custody so by reading that that told me this was not considered a leaving it was more like a detangler or a moisturizer so as I'm putting this on my hair um it is a really good detangler I'm like I was finger combing my hair and I was really able to like really go through my hair really easily which you know it's not easy for me and I did use quite a bit so it's a cream so I probably used about this much on each section on my hair and then spread some on to my ends but I want to say this is really a good detangler and this will definitely be a part of my staple that i will put on my hair prior to putting in my leave in conditioner because it also can be used as a moisturizer so on those days where I just need to retwist my hair I Wilkin definitely spritz my hair with my ACV put this on and then put my moisturizer on and sit under my steamer and my hair is so soft but I want to say this is really a good detangler I don't know for me if this would be a good moisturizer because it's so light in the ingredients on marshmallow root infused water avocado butter aloe vera gel tuk-tuks takuma butter babess of oil he whacks jump Jamal plus mallow extract and fragrance so um this is not really and I mean it's moisturizing but I don't think this would be I would have to use a really good moisturizing leaving to use this as a moisturizer because it's unless I'm just doing like maybe a twist out Lidge you know or not a twist down by the wash and go in my wash and go video basically i had this on my hair the leaving the pinkberry lemon leaving and a butter that i got from her which I would do a separate review and I just left my hair and so I was running my mouth on the phone but basically I really like this this will be a staple product in my stash my regiment whatever you want to call it and um y'all need to really give her a try her stuff is her products is really good and I think I'm kind of you know everything that I've tried I really like it did what it says it's supposed to do you know so um and it smells really good i know i'm a sucker for stuff that smell good probably whether it works or not so marshmallow fluff cream um really good detangler I mean really good evicted detangle this Curly's stuff is a good detangler so if i try heritage hydration really I'm sweet girl um fast shipping she would get your stuff out to you I haven't had to wait over a week and she does makes this stuff fresh so all her products so I'm really fast shipping she always shifts priority and reasonable price is really really good product so give it a try I check her out go to her site a new website I just want to say thanks for watching please like my video give me thumbs up leave your comment in the box below peace", "Q_jZdMaFPXw": "[Music] hey look it's Reagan today we show you different types of marshmallow frosting now we will hear the word marshmallow dessert Oh still see a certain flavor and texture with the frosting I'm talking to you about the differences between the recipes and their techniques these are quite easy and hard to get bro now any recipe uses egg whites and ever uses melted marshmallows the last one uses marshmallow cream now which one you use depends on only the taste but also we use this for the frosting and so let's get started the first two recipes are your basic marshmallow frosting from egg whites and sugar they like Swiss buttercream versus the Italian buttercream frosting the ingredients are the same which is that the order is different with the first technique combine the eggs sugar cream of tartar and salt on top of the double boiler you can use an equal amount of brown sugar instead of white sugar for a slightly different taste stir occasionally while cooking until the mixture reaches 160 degrees Fahrenheit remove them the heat and pour into the mixing bowl whip on high until stiff glossy peaks form and the frosting is cool [Music] [Music] here you can see how easy it is to spread the frosting that's it done second technique uses similar ingredients but starts by making a syrup of sugar and water and then adding it to the egg whites first add the sugar and water into a small saucepan you can use brown sugar here as well [Music] bring the mixture to a rapid boil in now add the egg whites to mixing bowl and whip into soft peaks form slowly pour the hot syrup into the egg whites and then whip on high until stiff and shiny peaks form [Music] you [Music] if you want you can add an extract of your choice that's it here you can see how thick the frosting is the third marshmallow frosting is made of marshmallows combined heavy cream confectioners sugar and marshmallows into a saucepan [Music] heat and stir over medium heat until the marshmallows have completely melted pour into the bowl and quickly whisk all the ingredients together place the mixture in the refrigerator for several hours to overnight I'll give the mixtures in the refrigerator the stiff of the frosting will be you can mixture out look the mixture on high with an electric mixer a whisk attachment works best but beaters work too will not be a really fluffy frosting so just be creamy frosting is made from a marshmallow cream this is the easiest frosting to make since it requires no cooking at all first eat the butter with the mixer then add confectionery sugar add in any extract finally mix the marshmallow cream that's it done [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] the marshmallow frosting made from egg whites is very sweet and fluffy I really like this frosting was made with brown sugar and use the top fall desserts like pumpkin sweet potato and Apple now this project is best served the same day because over time it just gets to here the next day it will stick to night they'll be really hard cupping dessert this frosting Buscemi a lot of the time just play dolls on top of that you easily cut around it now also this frosting I do like to toast it and to me this does need some acts of patience of a marshmallow frosting the marshmallow frosting that uses heavy cream and marshmallows is definitely being mildest of the frosting now this is also a sugary of these three crossings now some things about the frosted absolutely love is how creamy and easily it goes on to your cake and something else that's great about stock that over time it does not get sticky like the egg white frosting but sadly because of how soft and creamy it is you can also not decorate them see marshmallow frosting wait for me marshmallow cream it's about the middle-of-the-road sweetness and because the butter it comes across as a marshmallow flavored buttercream which honestly is pretty much what it is now what I love about this process and basically creamy smooth you can easily put it onto your cake it also does not get sticky so it can still cut through it for days and you can do some simple decorations with it the recipes are down below and if you like this video be sure to hit the subscribe button and thank you for watching you you", "nv6Is9_MHlk": "hey guys it's slam master and today we will be making slime out of just one two three and at least three ingredients now I'm gonna use glitter but you don't have to but if you don't use glitter and it's just gonna be white slime unless you add color which that is also optional so let's just get right onto the video okay hey guys so this is going to be my storage container and my making thing cuz I forgot to get it but so first we're going to add the glue so that is what it looks like when the UM the glue is poured in I'm going to make a smaller batch because I already have enough but I have to put in the shaving cream next so let's go so there's the shaving cream I love the feeling of shaving cream it's so soft I just don't love it love it love it okay so now we're gonna mix I will show you it when it's mixed okay so now it's mix now we have to put in contact solution so what contact solution saline solution so let's do it so you can't really see it that I like to add it in in but it's there so let me mix it and I'll show you it and see if it starts to come together so it's not really coming together yet it's like sort of but I think I don't know maybe let's try to add some friend let's mix it in I'll show you I don't know if it really came together or not you guys comment down below and say if it's gone it's done enough this is my first slime well it's actually not my first time I made it and then all my signs got ruined I don't know how but they got ruined and so this is my new slime my first new slime so now I'm going to get into it with my hands start mixing around maybe I should use to spin some more I don't know but once I kind of get it like slime I will show you okay so after mixing for about 20 minutes this is kind of what it looks like close up of the marshmallows light comment down below what what I should name my slime and you should name it marshmallows also comment down below if you think it should be much more less line let's take a vote marshmallow slime or fluffy glitter slide I'll give you 20 seconds to comment down below which one it should be 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 Wow well then 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 done you can do that in 20 seconds then you are as fast as Google that's why new saying so yep let me get it out with my hands and start filling with that and then I'll show you hey guys so I'm back my hands are so so messy sort of coming together I don't know hopefully this works cuz I use polish a whole bottle please work sign guys please just kidding the only God so I just took it out and so there it is it is super duper fluffy and sticky and just oh my goodness so it's kind of cleaning my hands a little bit not really maybe I should have more let me try that so after about an hour of mixing and adding contact lens solution I actually had to start adding some of my son anyway this is what it came out to be I think this worked I don't know so when I try to stretch it doesn't really stretch but it did clean my hands off so I don't think it's slime because whenever your hands are super dirty with glue and shaving cream and your slime is good it usually can just clean your hands right off and it's cleaning my table too which would really be helping because so I'm gonna give this one a thumbs up that I did it so I'm gonna give you 10 seconds to click that subscribe button like it and say what your channel is so I can subscribe to you if

that well once that's well combined add your 1/3 cup of powdered sugar and mix that all well and once everything is incorporated well again you can add in your fourth cup of powdered sugar and then mix that until it's all smooth and well combined and then I just scrape the bowl you can see here it is a pretty thick buttercream but then we're going to add in that marshmallow cream I had a half a can of it at a time and just fold it in with a spatula and then here did other half of the jar and then I just combined that again with the spatula just fold it in this buttercream does have a thick

there's a family-owned business it creates delicious marshmallow treats to help keep you cool I think that could work it's called fluffy marshmallow Gibby is there it's near Gilbert and whadda Lupe you are so lucky with this assignment Gib well who else to send but the fluffiest of us all and you know if it comes to treat so you got to send me to turn around and try it out but guys I got to tell you it smells amazing in here and these treats look oh so good that I can't wait to try these out but as we turn around and show you here around the fluffy they have everything from s'mores the cool drinks as you can see some of them being made here tricia RSA who started this about three years ago how'd you come up with the whole idea of marshmallow marshmallows was just at a contest I had at work and I found I love making marshmallows and it was a therapy when I lost my grandmother and I just kept going with it so I mean it is literally everything marshmallow that you can see here and how'd you just come up with this is something you just kind of just tried yeah it doesn't they I just tried and found that I really love the the science behind marshmallow and I figured you know there's cake shops cupcake shops ice cream shops right on a marshmallow shop and what can I do with marshmallows and let's show them what you can do as we can see here first of all is keeping people cool because when you look at these drinks they are going to keep you cool what are we taking a look at here these three these three drinks we have our Cookie Monster which is amazing and then we have our lava flow which I brought back from Hawaii and then we have our frozen hot chocolate we'll definitely keep you cool throughout the summer and let's talk about what she just put on the top that is the marshmallow there and you guys make that back here oh yeah that's our marshmallow whip we make that fresh every single day we make it by the gallons here in the store here's the thing summertime comes in people love camping for some it's too hot to go camping guess what you made it up or then you said I got you hooked on the s'mores and that's what you have yeah I got you we make our s'mores here in the store so you want to worry about the heat out there you want to worry about picking up a fire you don't about cleaning up the messes we'll do it all for a year in the store so right now she is making our strawberry shortcake some more sort of vanilla marshmallow strawberries yellow cake and frosting so it's awesome one thing we got to tell them though when you look at the bar of those Gerardo not only do they have the cookies but they make these graham cracker bowls right out back we make them all fresh every day our graham cracker bowls it's a lot less Messier and easier to pick up and just dive right into it oh and I could tell because look at this we have our superstar over here who's going to turn around to take a big bite for us over here all these folks who are coming out here getting out of heat this is the amazing part is you guys are open here you're closed on Sundays you're on Gilbert and water Lupe and when it comes to marshmallows you could pretty much say you own the market I own the market out here yeah definitely have free AC it's nice and full cool tunes great Suites and we're fun to have around alright so what do you want me to try I'm gonna take a bite of something here because I gotta try something over here you can try the strawberry shortcake and dive right into it let's see how you do it okay is there any rules I mean are there rules to this I the mores are posed to be messy so what do you thinks gonna happen oh yeah just do it alright guys I really don't know I tried I really really tried I tried it I try to be clean ha ha ha but it kind of just yeah that deserves it oh yeah that looks good oh yeah yes Gabey I feel like we'll leave you alone this is this is a moment between you and your marshmallows I love you it's true love cam who could blame him yeah", "oJpFC3WUXro": "good afternoon everybody how are you guys doing hope you are having a good day wherever you are it is for 15 in the afternoon Saturday afternoon and I almost forgot for some reason I thought it was Thursday but it's Saturday I'm beginning to forget what day is so today I decided to make make something I've never tried it but um it's a - including dessert using marshmallow and milk and we'll see how it turns out the only thing though one mistake I made is this I don't have the finished product and at the end I have two chili in the refrigerator for three hours so I can't really show you the finished product but it is like a pudding it's like a like a really simple pudding in a cup kind of dessert anyway let's make it okay let's make it shall we so the ingredients are as follows all we need are marshmallows and milk so we need a hundred grams of marshmallows and we need 200 cc's of milk 200 cc is 200 milliliters of milk so we're gonna give a milk from the refrigerator there's my milk hello Danielle hello gene hi Tokyo drew how are you guys doing hello Laura oh past midnight in LA I see you know we've been filming all day long today we have this it's not really an epic video but it's a video that demands the entire day so I we've been filming since we woke up and we're we're not finished filming yet we're actually it's gonna take until like the end of the day at night actually but this video is gonna be coming out next Saturday did you guys watch today's video the picnic I hope you guys did and if so did you guys enjoy it I hope you did hello Tracy from California hello Cheryl 3 7 3 17 am so early are you are you just going to bed or did you wake up or what simply Jean deadbeat three three hours of sleep oh my goodness gracious shady hello from Tunisia thanks for joining us yeah simply gene you like the video oh good awesome Laura so happy that you guys enjoyed that video alright so first of all I have to measure out the marshmallow so the way I'm gonna do it is let me show you the little scale that we have here so this is a scale so it's off right now so you put the bowl on top and then you press on and then it actually calculates the weight of the bowl so it starts at zero right here see so it's really easy to use we're gonna put this back here so I can film it okie dokie okie dokie and by the way your wondering oh my goodness I have to say maybe it's doing the live streams that's making Justin bark because he starts to bark again it's so weird okay so we need a hundred grams okay I'm glad I have another package of marshmallow right here because that's only 40 48 grams Justin Justin what's wrong what's wrong okay so hundred grams that's okay that's 99 there we go that's exactly a hundred grams of marshmallow that's more than I thought we'll be using okay and then we'll take that off we no longer need the skill I need this now and I need two hundred milliliters of milk but in two batches so if I can get my milk abysmal there we go so I'm gonna add 100 milliliters of milk right so that is about like a little over 1/3 cup if you are in America okay ah just didn't why every bump the milk into the marshmallows and it says to microwave this for I think I'm ended and a half so I think that's what we're doing what's wrong with him why is he upset that I'm doing the live streams so weird okay so we're going to put that you can't see the milk yeah there is a milking here don't you see there's smoke in here just in stop stop why why why are you doing this what you gonna turn it on so sorry I I don't know what's wrong with him I really don't know what's wrong him by the way this recipe is not my original but I bought a new cookbook and it's great although I haven't I tried two recipes from that cookbook totally failed totally failed now where is that cookbook it's gone I was gonna show it to you guys where did I put it it's so weird um okay that's weird anyway I'm gonna show you guys a package of kick get that I brought alright maybe he wants a little Oh No you want to snack or something all right Justin no goes hiking so local I feel to know God well so good yeah okay I think I'm gonna check on the marshmallow to see how it's going okay looks like that right now maybe I'll zap it for just a little bit more and then it says I have to whisk it with my umm mix it with my whisk and then melt the marshmallows so you know I'm gonna take it out now I made two things out of this recipe book and for some reason neither of them have come out for some reason I don't know why oh oh thank you took you drew you like my shorts thanks a lot it's from G you very very um reasonable it was like 900 yen okay and it says to whisk this until the marshmallows have melted hey hey smells yummy smells good at least huh oh that was easy oh it's already melted okay and at this point it says to add in a hundred milliliters of milk so there's a second batch of milk one moment okay here we go I'm gonna add the milk inside mix it up like so okay and then it says to divide divide it into little container so I have these four right here front of me so just divide them in here there are different sizes that one's a little big but that's okay and I'll use my lado I think yes I use my later so let's do that yeah so really hope really glad that most of you enjoy the picnic video it's the first time we did something like that on table eats we needed to do something creative on the topic its channel because usually it's all about travel going outside and we thought you know we can't go outside right now so bring the outdoors in instead and I thought you know it's a good idea for those of you that's getting bored at home and today's video that we're making the reason why it's taking us the entire day is because the title of the video is what we eat in a day yeah we're making one of those videos and we're filming every single morsel of food that we put into our mouth all day long all day long thank you Dad I'm so glad you you you like the picnic flowers Oh Thank You Tokyo drew I'm so glad you enjoyed it thank you is it best to fill it to the top um it doesn't really matter Nancy it doesn't really matter and that's great in me like four perfect cups of dessert and basically you chill this in the refrigerator and the top is supposed to sort of separate from the bottom so you get two different textures you get like an airy bubbly texture on the top well as the bottom is more like supposed to be more like gelatin but yeah you know I've never tried this before so I'm kind of looking forward to it so this goes into the refrigerator hopefully that turns out and once again I apologize because I forgot I was there's no way of me showing you the finished product unless I had made this once and put in the refrigerator which I should do next time so maybe I'll show this to you guys the finished product on my Instagram feed instead so let me put this in the refrigerator and I'll share the kick kack with you guys okay so please you guys want to see our very very messy refrigerator it's really messy I need to look for space in there for sure this is our messy refrigerator we've been cooking all day long for the filming these are like leftover ginger and chikuwa fish cake that's cream for another recipe and then subtle she made this last night this is a these are Mountain yams simmered in a like a soy sauce thing so that's for later and then we will put the desserts in the refrigerator to chill all righty and you know what I hope it's okay if I put the camera down this will take forever okay that's the sound of the refrigerator letting me know that the door is open alrighty so that's pretty much the recipe and and since it was so easy to make isn't that easy so hopefully that turns out yummy I'm I'm praying that that turns out fine I'm pretty sure it will so oh it's hot today it's like a beginning of summer today the weather so suddenly my face is all oily so this is that package of Kit Kats that I actually shared with people on only in Japan Jon's Channel the other day and this is the ocean salt of flavor KitKat and I gotta say that this is what you know I was not expecting much from this I Nissan konichiwa this is actually from - uh-oh - I thank you so much for this for a near sukhoi Co Korea I was not expecting much because it's you know it's just ocean salt flavor so I mean how good could it be right but I actually found this to be very delicious and I think it's all my favorite cats I think so let me let me show you guys here I need to show you guys what it looks like okay the cool thing number one the first cool thing about this is the packaging look each packaging each little packet of KitKat has a different design look you have dolphin you have jellyfish you have starfish you have a seal you even have a war Asst you have a shark and you have simply one that says ocean salt but isn't it great and all Japanese Kit Kats these days have this on the back where you can actually write a little message and give it to a friend yeah I I never do that but okay so maybe we'll open up the starfish yes is 28 degrees Celsius now in Tokyo I Nissan daijoubu Nagar I know but in Ionia and yeah it looks simple you know it looks unassuming it looks like your typical white chocolate KitKat right but let me tell you it is delicious it it tastes because of the salt and because you're using ocean salt the salt has a little bit of sweetness and depth as well it kind of reminds me of like salted caramel you know what I mean but without the caramel and it's so hard to explain but this is one of the most delicious KitKat I've had in my life in Japan at least I don't know what's wrong with Justin but once again I apologize mmm delicious so good hmm so ah I found the cookbook I found the cookbook alright let me share with you guys this is a pretty cool cookbook you know how I like up I like cookbooks that show you shortcuts you know show you hacks and tricks I like cookbooks like that I have a lot of cookbooks that teach you how to make um things from scratch which is fine you know I don't mind making things from scratch sorry sorry trying to get the right why is the lighting it's so weird okay just did just did sorry Justin really once attention doesn't he does he doesn't he thank you so much avocado how do you got though you know what it is so hot today I'm not used to this I didn't think I was I would feel so hot today so Nancy you too huh right because Oh Justin sorry justice but is in the way Justin you okay okay okay Oh righty please excuse me he needs some attention right now he's not going to leave me alone okay is that enough for now is that enough I hope so okay here you go here's a book here's the book ah oh my gosh you you what's wrong with you today what is wrong with you what is wrong with you today oh my gosh how do I exercise at home well if I'm on the floor Justin ends up kissing me but I'm I'm kind of used to it either that or I'll like pet him with one hand while I do something with mother oh my gosh all right Justin oh all right you're not gonna let me show them the cookbook anyway this is the cookbook guys it's Japanese obviously and now he's sitting in front of the book oh now he's oh no now he has his hand on the book dude you don't want me to open the book for some reason anyway Justin is uh almost 12 years old actually right Justin look look at that he's thick the cool thing about this book is that it's very very easy there are 73 recipes in here and like I said I tried two of them and for some reason it didn't turn out right so I'm hoping that this one does and the first chapter is all about two ingredient recipes so basically this is to make these chocolate cookies all you need are two ingredients you only need a hundred grams of chocolate and all-purpose flour that's it but for some reason it didn't turn out maybe I was using wrong type of chocolate I'm not sure so these are all two ingredient recipes like this is called is two ingredients oh this is the one that I just made for you guys this is the two ingredient marshmallow mousse pudding yeah and so that's how it's supposed to look when it finishes right Justin I think this one is gonna turn out okay I think so I'll share it with you guys once it's uh once it's done you know my good then you see how he like he sits in he sits where I noticed him that that's what he he does all the time like he'll he'll switch positions is if I'm not looking his way right and then the next chapter is three ingredients and then it's like four ingredients I think five ingredients is the most but isn't this great and the other thing I want to try oh this is the other one that I failed it was to make Japanese pudding I like flan Japanese flan in the microwave and for some reason I totally failed it didn't turn out right and the one I'm really interested is this one this is a souffle cheesecake you know the the Japanese style cheesecake the really fluffy one this is making it with only three ingredients it's only three eggs sugar and cream cheese yeah and and so I kind of want to try this one out and let's see isn't this a cool book I love this book I mean is if this dessert turns out good then I love this book so far two recipes have failed me but I think it's my fault probably maybe I was rushing not sure yes Justin please be careful and this one I'm thinking of making this one as well do you guys know on the almond tofu the onion dough foo in Chinese is written like this maybe you know what I'm talking about I don't know what you call it in English maybe it's called almond tofu but you can make this in a milk carton like this and with just one two three four five ingredients and yeah you just make everything in a milk carton put everything in the milk carton put in the refrigerator and serve it out of the milk carton isn't that cool so I really want to try this one out yeah hello nan show Brad and this is a cheesecake made inside a milk carton as well so I kind of want to do like a maybe I don't know like a variation on this so that I don't make exactly the same thing and that's jell-o made in a milk carton as well but anyway I think this is really cool yeah anyways it's a really good book it's called I'm not this book does not sponsor me at all whatsoever but called Mahalo can you kill yet to me which means the magic recipes are easy magic recipes something like that that's what it means all right so that's it I just wanted to make something for you guys you're really really simple I know a lot of you guys made the cinnamon rolls and you liked it I'm so happy I know a few of you tried the chocolate cake and I know that one of you made a much of version of it which looks really really cool but yeah I'm gonna like experiment with these like easy recipes on this channel I think it's a lot of fun and it seems like you guys like it as well avocado no this is not the bread book this is a different book yeah the bread book is another book yeah this one is um another book that I got I ordered online recently because I no longer can go to the book store unfortunately alright so um please join us tomorrow Sunday we have another weekly live stream over on top eats at 1:00 p.m. Japan time I have no idea what we're gonna be doing but we'll figure something out and I have to go and call Satoshi we have to continue our filming for the day Thanks so so much for watching hello a 1 I hope you guys I hope you're doing

stuff it's my dog and he thinks I have food over here so yeah so what you need is a bull ain't nothing in it a bowl I'll show you guys oh he just really wants he loves food so you need a bowl something can mix with and I'm making you mixing you lit the purple spoon and some light blue light blue clear blue contact lens solution and stand cream so let's get to it so the first thing you'll want to use is this white glue you're gonna want to take the cap off do not have to use this kind of white glue Elmer's glue is the best glue T mu but and I'm going to dance that's why I have this trap you just want to pour the whole thing in or less it doesn't matter up to you your choice and at the end you can add optional things to put influenced make sure one thing I recommend not doing is adding those you know those when you fill the things up on the side like so there's like a kind of B they you don't want to use and because it melts your slime and it they melt in your slime and next thing you want to add is your shaving cream wait no your contact lens solution and it will not activate it so don't worry the shaving cream well now you want your shaving cream but don't add too much shaving cream because you don't want your son to beat you I know you're gonna mix it mix see it's not activating because the shaving cream is not actual activator if you want an actual activator need a liquid starch or five contacts one solution and baking soda but you could also make it my way and then just add some shaving cream mmm make your slime smell really good too so you just want to add that much about that much and just keep stirring and if your mixture does not form it's a spawn just keep mixing or just add more time to collection and you could add different kinds of activators until if your son doesn't activate all right so I'm gonna add baking soda so I'll be right back my baking soda right now so I'm just gonna add my liquid starch make sure that's odd too much my baking soda [Music] and here we go we're getting somewhere we're getting somewhere in the video that nobody's getting bored and if you get this contact from Fujian you're I didn't hurt him it is for your eyes if you want a kick so I'm just add a medium up I'm out of activator I'm gonna open my starch does this a lot yeah mom will you help me cuz as you can see it's it's just whipped cream comment down below if you want me to do edibles on Monday no my spoon filling again okay I'm just gonna go in with my hands cuz it's a time there's one time and wife on them get down under right now it's gonna be right now so I'm just gonna hold the ball and get going okay hey let's just see if it's activating in it's not it's just a lump and if it's just one you need more activator okay okay okay so I added more later now now it's not just one now it's something it's something now it's something now at least it's something it at one point was just nothing a little bit more a solanum and you might want to add a little bit more activator it's okay to add more activator because sometimes it just doesn't activate Miller activator so I'm just gonna dump this I'll have a table and get my favorite dirty more ugly not probably no no no I mean it does much out over there so thanks very sticky gonna go somewhere I got blue in it sign it and trust me next week I got it on camera okay oh oh and gee did that just really happen did that really just happen oh my gosh I just I just got the slime on camera on my camera okay oh my god oh my god ad is way too much way too much way too much activator emergency

yeah so this is an invention I mean so let's try it now and it's also s'mores basically it I lost him I was actually pretty good and so it tasted just like s'mores but instead of the cracker it's basically just toast like see here is the Nutella and there's the s'mores Larry if you guys are interested in trying this all you need is to toast it and make your average toast with Nutella and then if you have marshmallow fluff you could just put it on and then just toast it look at that okay and then you just toast it and it'll turn out with this and it's actually pretty good and now it's time for me to try it without after the video so now you know open this here's what put it on there scoop it and AH wait three two one mmm delicious I like I like the tape it's taste like your average

don't think it'll be that interesting but I'll do it anyway yeah I'm gonna put the fluff into the microwave sans led of course because that'll just be a huge sticky mess to clean up and put the fluff right there close this bad boy up and figure six minutes should be enough all right time to examine what we did the post product looks very messy this is a real to clean up hot marshmallow not the most fun thing to clean out of your microwave it doesn't smell too bad so is this safe to microwave well technically yes should you microwave it now now I guess you could microwave it is kind of entertaining but doesn't really do anything to improve your marshmallows in fact you're going to be throwing some marshmallows away but it is safe to microwave so there's really no harm in doing this and I have to say that this is a push unlike doing straight marshmallows where marshmallows melt into a kind of edible sauce it's just leaks everywhere burns and isn't really best kind of consistency doing anything with and smells nice but tastes like so I'm gonna have to declare this a push you", "m61__yo16Zo": "a child showed this would be shortest better I've ever made by the way ignore the

who describes it as the creamiest peanut butter fudge ever other members describe it simply as fudge perfection and melt in your mouth delicious let's get started by lining a 9 by 13 inch baking dish with parchment paper and then spraying the paper with vegetable spray in a large saucepan over medium heat add four cups of sugar one cup of light brown sugar half a cup of butter and a 12-ounce can of evaporated milk combine the mixture and stir it constantly until it comes to a full rolling boil once the mixture starts boiling stop stirring and let the mixture boil for seven minutes the duration is important so be sure to set your timer letting it boil without stirring keeps sugar crystals from forming and makes for a creamier smoother fudge take the mixture off the heat and add 1 7 ounce jar of marshmallow cream stir the cream in until it's melted and well incorporated then add a 16-ounce jar of peanut butter a teaspoon of vanilla and stir it all together until it's smooth make sure the peanut butter doesn't sink to the bottom and is well combined pour the fudge into the prepared pan spread it out evenly allow the fudge to cool completely before cutting it into squares as Allrecipes member irenan oats this makes a huge recipe but the upside is that you'll always have fudge in the freezer for that craving", "TOSC1v0wJm0": "[Music] hello and welcome to my kitchen today I made these ghost cupcakes that orange velvet cupcakes with marshmallow icing so if you'd like to see how I made them keep watching so the ingredients are we using today a 60 grams of softened butter 3/4 of a cup of sugar 1 egg 1/4 TSP of gel food coloring I've mixed together yellow and red to make orange half a cup of buttermilk 1 and a quarter cup of plain flour 1/2 a teaspoon of salt 1 teaspoon of orange zest half a teaspoon of vanilla extract 1/2 a tbsp of vinegar and half a teaspoon of bicarbonate soda I have other preheating at 170 degrees Celsius and I've also placed cases into the cupcake tube to get started with the cupcake batter I'm going to create together the butter and sugar next step is to add the food coloring and the eggs [Music] and now for the orange zest vanilla salt butter milk and flour now for the vinegar and bicarb soda I'm popping the vinegar in first and giving that a bit of stir and then I'll add the back half [Music] now it's time to scoop the cupcake batter into the prepared pieces now these are going in the oven for about 20 minutes okay I'm just going to pop these cupcakes to the side and allow them to cool in the tin for 10 minutes and then a completely cool on a wire rack now that those cupcakes have cooled I'm going to make the marshmallow icing so for that I need 1 cup of sugar 3 tablespoons of water 2 egg whites a pinch of cream of tartar and a pinch of salt first up I need to bring to the ball the sugar and the water and I'm just going to constantly stir it until the sugar has dissolved [Music] now that that syrup is ready I'm going to beat together the egg cream of tarter and the salt just until it forms soft peaks I'm going to pop my fix on medium and just smelt it in the syrup here and I'm going to bake that on the medium speed for about five minutes and the egg white mixture should call and be nice and fluffy so I've just put my icing in a piping bag and I'm just going to pry it little blobs on top so they kind of look like ghosts and I'm going to add just some little spots with black food coloring so they look like ice and here they are orange velvet ghost cupcakes with marshmallow icing thanks for watching

need is a bunch of marshmallows mini marshmallows and big marshmallows and i made this stretchy marshmallow edible like slime kind of stuff so it looks like this you can stretch it around make it different shapes you can make it a ball do a bunch of things with it you can also eat it it's kind of hard to get a piece off it's got like a weird hard time texture but again like marshmallowy it feels like a bunch of marshmallows just got stacked on top of each other and melted together and just became one giant hard marshmallow um but all you need is a microwave marshmallows in a bowl and a spoon so here's how to make it so you want to have a bowl out and mini marshmallows or big marshmallows i don't care it doesn't really matter and pour a bunch into the bowl and then go put the marshmallows with the bowl into a microwave then microwave it for 30 seconds then take it out start like whisking it around with your spoon until it becomes soft and like you can feel it you can kind of it like you can see that it's kind of like being able now to just you can just pull it off the spoon and then um just keep kneading it around like this and stretching it and stuff and then you'll have the marshmallow fluff um so i hope you guys enjoyed this video and yeah so please like and subscribe and bye guys", "wGZYo3PAojE": "hi guys what's up welcome back to my channel so in today's video I'm going Cerie I'm going to it show you how to make marshmallow fluff slime so the ingredients okay so I was testing this recipe out and it made this actually really decent slime this is not how it's supposed to turn how I added too much cornstarch so yeah so the ingredients that you'll need is some school glue some contact solution and baking soda or any other activator cornstarch water two spoons and a bowl so what you want to do first is take your school glue which I'm gonna be more exact with this and actually listen to what she did okay so she sent to one to which I actually have two of these three woops form sorry about the background noise five and last but not least number six so now that I have that she said to add in honey to get an extra spoon which is totally okay so then she said to add in six tablespoons of corn starch which I think I added too much cream search in my other one so I'm gonna try not to add too much to three four five six so that was really heat so yeah now I'm getting corn starch all over the place but so mix that in also you will need 6 pinches of baking soda 3 4 5 6 6 pinches of that mix all of that up [Music] sorry again without the background noises so once that gets all mixed up you will have this not full dough yet then add in one tablespoon of water which um if you're making less or more you know it will depend on how much glue and cornstarch and stuff you have so 1 tablespoon of water now the reason I did like 2 is because the first one didn't have enough water in it so mix all of that up and I think I'm gonna need more of my water here in a second but I'm gonna try so then I said to take 8 tablespoons of the contact solution which um I didn't really want to add that much because I wanted this to actually not be over activated so you the video actually said for it to be 8 tablespoons with 6 teaspoons of glue but I didn't want this to over activate like my other way so now I should be able to touch it with my hands now this is the consistency that I was hoping for whenever I first made it sorry about the bowl hitting the table wow this is such a good consistency now that I actually followed her rules okay which I watched mmm think about it hey I watched knocked around this is such a good consistency I really like this consistency um this is actually the best consistency of slime that I've ever heard this is such a good slime I love it whenever macaron did it I had no idea it was this good of a texture like Baz you guys are at home you're thinking oh I don't think is that good of a texture this is the best texture ever now it's a little stiff so I'm gonna add one not even one like half of a table spoon more of water to it just to give it more of a sticky extra texture sorry yeah okay I love this texture now it's like really good like guys if you have all the ingredients that I have here you need to make this it's the best line ever now um you can take a marshmallow fluff container and clean it out now I don't have one that is almost empty I have one that is a fool so this is a really good consistency I want it to be more stretchier so I'm adding in all wah - wah - wah - wah - which is totally optional now it was a really good texture at first but I mean the more water you add the more stretchy it'll be now I would feel like um I would feel like marshmallow fluff is more as it's sticky because it's marsh mellows but no so it actually is but I mean this is really good I love it thank you all so much for watching this video make sure - like some super rad and um and to make this line because it is really good so bye", "MckejvZ16WA": "and it's cutting marshmallow fluff cuz I didn't have any food coloring and I don't have any shaving cream but I so-called I don't know I

a lot of sweet !!! This is Oreo cupcake ! I bought it in ASDA ( UK supermarket ) I bought these rocks from a souvenir shop in Stonehenge Let's eat the brown rock first !!! Chocolate inside~~ Not hard to bite , but super sweet I love the texture of it ( hard to explain HaHa ) Which color do you like the most : Brown ? Black ? White ? Too sweet for breakfast haha Let me ask you guys a question . Do you know what stone in stonehenge made of ? There are two types of stone The massive one are sandstone and the smaller one are bluestones So now , let's eat the Oreo donut I bought the donut from a small supermarket which is near to my school It is not fresh actually. I bought it two days ago That is why the texture is a bit tough Strong chocolate flavor but not Oreo Anyone like Oreo dessert too ? I remember one of my schoolmate share one of the Oreo donut to me. That's why I fall in love in it >< It doesn't have any filling inside It's just like a tough chocolate donut So now, let's move on to the Oreo muffin Surprised ! It is so soft ~ Strong flavor of butter and chocolate The muffin is much more tastier than the donut But the Oreo cream on top is too sweet for me So I will only eat the muffin I wish you guys can try it. It is so soft I bought it in Asda too ^^ One more bite  Hehe I promise this is the last bite Ok I'm done with this Finally the last dessert is Marshmallow fluff It is like a dream to have it Do you guys remember Clementine ( Clem ) ? She asked her friend to buy this for me I went to different supermarket in UK but still cannot find it Do you have this in your country ? For Hong Kong , we don't have this It smells so good. Can't wait to have it ! Do you like the sound ? It looks soft and sticky Oh yes , I love it It is extremely sweet. It taste familiar with melted marshmallow I'm sure if I put it on a roasted toast , it will be so tasty I saw a lot of Korean ate this on the video . And today it's my turn to try it >< But I think roasted marshmallow taste better than marshmallow fluff . coz roasted marshmallow have a crunch on the outside ! But for me , it is already the best dessert Cannot stop eating even though it is sweet I am so happy I can show you guys what I bought from UK. And the place that I stay is Bournemouth ^^ I went there to have a study tour for 12 days Don't forget to like and subscribe ~ Bye Bye ~~", "MuXQELUCArM": "hey I'm Beth I'm Tosh and today we are doing

watching our video and we will see you later", "EixpnQRC2hw": "[Music] one dimensional sugary candies aren't usually my thing but marshmallows are a different story make a s'more and I'll come running before your campfire toasting twig has a chance to cool but a few years ago when I was prepping for a s'mores making party I just couldn't pull the trigger on the jet puffed purchase it's been a few years since my day sitting around the camp Longhorn campfire and today I know a lot more about what goes into processed foods I don't want tetrasodium pyrophosphate or blue one in my marshmallows making marshmallows at home is fun simple and a little bit messy but they're super easy to clean up after homemade aren't just better because they're additive free the texture is so much better than store-bought plus they melt and toast like a dream since the marshmallow mixture is really sticky I start by lining a 13 by 9 inch baking pan with a foil sling remember to let the edges hang over by a few inches this will give you something to hold on to when it's time to remove the firm marshmallow from the pan I also spray the sling with vegetable oil spray to prevent sticking the key to marshmallow structure is gelatin without it they can't set up and you'd end up with something more like marshmallow fluff start by blooming two and a half tablespoons of gelatin and your mixer bowl with half a cup of cold water to soften it just sprinkle the gelatin over the water and let it sit for at least 15 minutes while that's sitting you can switch gears and prepare the sugar mixture in a saucepan combine half a cup of water 1/3 cup of corn syrup 2 cups of granulated sugar and 1/4 teaspoon of salt since we want to avoid any possible crystallization be careful when pouring the sugar into the pan pour it into the center of the pan and try not to get any on the pan sides now just one note about corn syrup I'm not a huge fan but I decided there's no getting around it here I tried making them without it and they just didn't come out right and weren't worth the hassle plus this is the plain corn syrup not the high-fructose stuff so it's not all that bad bring everything to a boil over medium I heat you can swirl the pan gently from time to time but don't stir it let the mixture go for about six to eight minutes until the syrup reaches 240 degrees at this point the 15 minutes for the gelatin should be up go ahead and secure your whisk attachment and flip the mixer to low to break up the gelatin a bit then slowly and carefully pour in the hot sugar syrup try not to hit the side of the bowl or the Wyss to avoid splattering now gradually increase the mixer speed to high after a few minutes of beating that steaming near translucent and kind of smelly liquid will turn opaque white and expand to nearly fill the bowl you'll think gee I better stop well don't it isn't quite firm enough keep going you want to mix it for a full 10 to 12 minutes the key is to keep going into the bowl feels to just barely warm I just touched the bottom outside of the bowl every few minutes to check it you don't want it to totally cool off and you'll make a heck of a mess getting it out of the bowl but push it as far as you can to ensure firm springy marshmallows toward the end I also like to add two teaspoons of vanilla extract if you want to get creative you could also try another extract like mint or coconut what happens next should happen fast using a spatula you've sprayed with oil scrape the marshmallow into the prepared baking pan this mixture is sticky and stringy and gets harder to work with the cooler it gets so be speedy don't try to scrape every last bit out of the bowl if you start futzing with that stuff the blob and the dish is gonna firm up into some strange weird uneven shape once you've gotten what you can out of the bowl smooth the top and set it aside in a small bowl whisk together half a cup of cornstarch and half a cup of confectioner's sugar sift a couple tablespoons of this mixture over the marshmallow and save the rest for dusting the marshmallows later then cover the marshmallow and let it set up overnight the next day dust a little of the cornstarch mixture on a cutting board and spray a chef's knife with oil the marshmallow will be nice and firm at this point so you can pull the foil sling out of the pan and peel off the foil sift another two tablespoons of the cornstarch mixture on top of the marshmallow before cutting it into 1-inch wide strips then cut these strips into cubes respray your chef's knife if you feel like it's starting to stay you could also cut them smaller if you wanted to make cute little minis working with a few marshmallows at a time roll them around in the cornstarch mixture then toss them in the strainer over the sink to get off the excess powder the marshmallow can be stored in a ziploc bag or airtight container for up to two weeks but take them to a cookout or a winter party and I don't think he'll be coming home with any leftovers and that's it homemade marshmallows your s'mores and your hot chocolate will never be the same they also make a great holiday gift especially when you pair them with some homemade hot cocoa or mix them with graham crackers you can find this recipe and 100 others in the America's Test Kitchen DIY cookbook there's something in here for everyone from how to make those graham crackers and hot cocoa mix I mentioned to Greek yogurt and sriracha it's really cool stuff so check it out [Music]", "tOcCPxEh1GA": "hey y'all so i know it's been a while since i did a video but i wanted to do a quick video for you guys um about the marshmallow fluff so as you can see we changed the packaging this is how it comes now and this is how it used to come um now believe it or not for new followers this is how it originally came this is where we started um but the orders the purchases for it was like so fast like they were selling out so fast we couldn't really keep up with these containers we couldn't get them shipped to us fast enough um so we started using these um and when we did i kind of started liking them so i just stuck with them a little longer it was supposed to be a temporary change but i stuck with them a little bit um longer this was around christmas time so the orders for christmas was coming in a little faster and more than we expected so um so yeah it was supposed to be a temporary change and we just kind of stuck with it for a while just never went back but i actually prefer these containers i like these um and we're not totally getting rid of this container this container will be used for something else and we'll talk about that another time but um so yeah if you purchased your marshmallow fluff and it came like this now when you purchase it's going to come like this so um so don't be confused wondering what you got in the mail it's going to come like this if it looks like this it's going to come like this it's the same thing same recipe we actually added a little more moisture to it we added a little more shea butter to it um and i think this one had about seven ounces this one is eight ounces so it's like a extra ounce something like that um this is our best seller this marshmallow fluff is the best seller selling product we have right now um of course the lotion ranks up there too but the marshmallow fluff is one of our best sellers um it has shea butter in it and marshmallow root in it um most people are familiar with shea butter it's moisturizing properties and marshmallow root is really good like helping us the skin to heal and it's really good at helping um the whip to glide on your skin smooth because you use this to you can use this to shave or you can use this to bathe it's a two in one let's see if y'all could see that it's a two in one and you use it to shave or you use it to bathe and what i like to do let y'all see it you can see that smells so good so so so good what i like to do is i scoop up a little bit in my hand and i use my hand to rub it all over my body in the shower i do it after i wash it whatever soap or whatever i use or you can use this as so it works as a soap but i like to use whatever cleanser i want to use and then i rub this on here kind of like that um that extra moisturizing buffing kind of thing after i'm done cleaning my skin um so yeah these are the three i wish i can't pick them all up at once these are the three scents that it comes in um so yeah just to give y'all a little update on the packaging in case you're looking and wondering what's going on you see a different packaging that's what the deal is with the marshmallow fluff so y'all go on the website also sign up on a website um those who sign up on a website will get

seems to love these squares and they're so quick and easy to make the only thing if you've ever made these before you know that this mixture is really sticky so the trick is to either butter or spray all your bowls your utensils pots pans and then everything will work out perfectly so I'm going to use a nine inch square which is 23 centimeter baking pan now if you want because I like my rice krispies treats quite thick you could use a 9 by 13 23 by 33 centimeter pan if you like a thinner square so as you can see just spray or you could butter it and then in a large bowl I've also sprayed this bowl put 6 cups of rice krispies that's 150 grams and have that ready and then I am going to spray my spatula again and I'm going to spray we need a medium sized saucepan so I'm also gonna spray the inside of that because we're going to melt some marshmallows and we don't want that mixture to stick to the pot so the first thing we're gonna do is put 3 tablespoons about 40 grams I'm using unsalted butter and I'm just gonna put that in my saucepan and along with the quarter or just an eighth of a teaspoon of salt just a touch of salt now you could instead use salted butter you could use margarine you could use one of those soft buttery spreads if you like to use that as well and then I'm just going to melt this over medium heat and have ready a 10 ounce which is about 285 gram bag of I just like to use the miniature marshmallows because they melt fast but you could use a large marshmallows or you could even use homemade marshmallows that you just kind of cut out so just melt your butter okay and now jump in my marshmallows and then you want to stir constantly and just heat until all the marshmallows are melted and you have a nice smooth mixture okay so remove that from the heat I didn't mention but try to use marshmallows that are really fresh because they melt really nicely if you've ever used ones that are a little stale they don't melt quite as nicely as the fresh ones so then I'm just going to add a half a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract just add a little extra flavor and then just pour over your rice krispies as you can see and these are really fast to make great afterschool treat for the kids and then just stir to coat all your Rice Krispies now some people like to fold ins you know eating raisins or chocolate chips or M&M something like that or sprinkles I just like mine plain and then looks pretty good hopefully I've got it off sure you get the bottom of the bowl and then pour into your pan it's a sticky part here I didn't spray this so make sure you spray everything I'm just going to what I often do is just spray my hands and then find that the easiest I mean you could use a butter or a piece of wax paper and do that but I find it easier just use my hands okay so just press firmly and you're done so um just let these cool you know 10-15 minutes and then just use a sharp knife and cut them and they can be covered and stored for a few days so until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm [Music]", "JRktudjrArM": "[Music] it's me makes me shake share this Miguel I just want to show you finish the video I need to

let's get a bit comfy yeah so while we was shopping on the weekend I found this marshmallow fluff and it's like an American thing and we've never had it before and it was the first time that I had seen it so we decided to get it and I don't think we would give it a try but if you're watching and regularly consume this marshmallow fluff what do you do with it I noticed on the side there was said something like mush Miller fluff and peanut butter as a sad which is it like a spread is that why are you doing it no don't we just give it a whirl oh it's quite thick it's kind of its kind of amazing it's like sickly-sweet let me just try one little bit more and I'm double dipping this you know okay that's totally good I can't eat peanuts I'm allergic but I do have almond butter I wonder if it would be the same kind of thing you know it's good to please um if you do you know regularly had this Oh know what you meant to do with it please let me know it because I would love to try it out in a recipe or something is it good didn't you see no it's not medicine does it taste like medicine yeah well it's just like a a spread or something I think like Vegemite or almonds better it's pretty

left have a baby and when she had it baby she's set up happy Malo which makes marshmallows excellent yes really tasty ones and I've never made Marshall eyes mellows before so he's going to show me what to do apparently really easy fun good don't be scared easy and delicious and got the best thing ever so what kind of marshmallows we gonna make we are gonna make vanilla marshmallows these particular ones are going to be egg free you can make marshmallows with egg but I prefer this because it's slightly firmer texture and I think they last longer and I just like them more and less it makes my eyes brilliant let's go so first we're going to need 24 grams of powdered gelatin it looks like this to start with and then you mix it with a quarter of a cup of water and just get a little whisk and it blooms like this and then you're going to need half a cup of liquid glucose which is roughly 140 grams and then 3/4 of a cup of castor sugar and then some water about half a cup and also a bit of vanilla oh yeah a bit of vanilla about 2 teaspoons equipment-wise what else we going to use okay so you need a saw preferably one that's quite deep because your sugar syrup is going to boil up a little bit and you need a sugar thermometer you need a mixer with a whisk attachment a couple of spatulas and they've got oil on them as well just one rather than my like least one not greased mixing it up you also need an 8 by 8 inch tin and that's just been lined with a bit of cling film and then grease all over with a bit of flavorless oil okay so this is the consistency you're looking for after your gelatine has bloomed for a minimum of 5 minutes it's kind of like an a grainy jelly looks like a massive freak cast oh yeah it doesn't taste like that I wish it was about me to know this is going to go in the microwave for 30 seconds so that's done and this is what you want so just got back to liquid form give it a little whisk just check there's no lumps so this just goes into the mixer straight up it makes all of it alright and then what else then you want half of your liquid glucose in nurses say for the other half just do that have to be exactly half looking like we know it can be winged I'm gonna win this yeah because it's quite sticky so you can yeah oh it's really cool it quickly occurs and you could buy this at the supermarket right yeah it comes usually in tubes of about 140 grams which is pretty much exactly what you need in the baking section the baking is already so that's you reckon that's about all I'll do right so now what happens now you just need to pop it on to the lowest speed and just keep that running so that when you pour in your sugar syrup the whisk is already moving which is much safer and just stops crystallization like that stuff no faith burning my face back right there we go whew oK we've got that going and I'm guessing she desserts I know Gesserit fine so we've gone the time danger yeah three chords to a cup of sugar yeah that goes in doesn't my or deep in him well you to put the water and fast but it's gonna be fine and then half a cup of water what about two milliliters and then the rest of your liquid glucose as well and you shouldn't really do this without a thermometer right I'm thinking you can but you'd want to do it if you after you've made it a few times and you know what you're looking for right with whisk it because she would rise again she's done there's a load of times and you just need to heat that until it gets between 112 and 115 degrees Celsius right yes so pretty pretty out sights it is and it's you don't wanna go any further back because you end up with chewing gum so you gave me really good tip earlier I'm gonna give these guys a tip I think you need with tip because a lot of people have trouble making marshmallows and it's all down to calibration of your thermometer calibration do that by putting your thermometer into a saucepan or boiling water on a voyage rolling boil and make a note of the temperature it gets to and if it's anything above or below 100 degrees then you know you need to subtract or add that to the temperature that we take the syrup to it's ready to go so you need to take your thermometer out okay be careful we're good daddy I'm scared and time movers quickly spot already poor him it's whatever syrup and slowly instead right that all in okay so one sitting and it looks like it's all incorporating you want to turn it up to a medium to high speed and you running for about five minutes all right do it ha half of it come hither and you can see that it's kind of gone I pay and it's kind of almost doubled in size doesn't in size I'm still very drippy though nowhere near marshmallow so at this point we need to turn it up to an even higher speed and go for about another five minutes it's got a nice long trip again kind of holding its shape on the whisk wow this is the point that I like to put in vanilla okay so two teaspoons of vanilla mm-hmm into there and then that needs to go back on to your really high speed for about two minutes until it's all with whipped in and looking fluffy and lovely alright then you've got a spatula here will lightly grease you just going to help and just tip all that out into your pre line to contain that oh it's a lovely look once you've done that just smooth out as much as you can to all the edges and you've got to move quite quickly because it's setting all the time that's had about a minute just sitting around doing nothing it's some tacky on top okay and then you need to sprinkle it with this mixture here which is 50/50 of corn flour and icing sugar about one to two cups of each which is more than enough and just take a generous handful and sprinkle it on top right so it's all is powder on it and now it happened and now I'm afraid you have to leave overnight or four to six hours minimum average temperature but don't worry Gemma for the purpose of YouTube I have made one earlier thank you babe and it's here whew laughter I get to turn out yeah you do want a nice dusted surface so that's just the same stuff with yep exactly the same tip it out Oh smooth and lovely Oh need to peel back this cling film oh look at that magical something that really happy opposites is still really sticky is a nice sharp knife that's been sitting in some boiling water got that right here and then just slice through it right left cut all my pieces up and they're all really sticky now ah but if you're squishy so we're going to toss them in this mixture that we've had ready made by our own icing sugar get your hands in okay no probably I'll toss just sipping now all right let's get rid of the excess and then I'll just pop them in it yeah yay well I need to have one I think you do okay banging him yeah take take the biggest one they get strong shove it in your mouth I'm not gonna shove it in my mouth yeah just say goodbye okay hmm they're good aren't they mm-hmm Wow they're not like know if they've mark too they're really light on yeah they're really light and not too sickly come on melt in your mouth hmm I'm really not rotating because we've used really nice vanilla yeah makes all the different really does anything homemade is always better than shop-made yeah and do these these toast just as well are so good definitely toast them definitely taste them without doubt and have fun with flavors too I won't even go mad with flavors and colors what can people do what sort of things well I would probably kind of keep it simple to start with maybe try fruit juices or extracts so you could do lemon one just bloom your gelatin and some lemon juice and then shave a bit of lemon zest into it at the end into the mixture you've got nice lemon marshmallow so you can go wild so there's your perfect really really super simple vanilla marshmallows and if you liked that video and you want to see more videos then subscribe to my channel by clicking that link and if you want to buy

guys um make sure to comment down below any suggestions you have and share this video if your friends and family too [Applause]", "TR__5cI-bm8": "today Kevin and I have two different things to try for you but I think they're gonna go well in the Sun video I have the chip a natural creamy peanut butter and I have a strawberry marshmallow fluff mishmash sends us the marshmallow fluff from Michigan she bought it at the Christmas tree shops for a dollar twenty nine we bought the Jeff natural creamy peanut butter at Walmart we pay 208 for it and we bought it because Sherri requested that we review it so I figured I would put them both together in the same video quickly good together actually and that's what I'm thinking I'm thinking we can try them on their own and then move trom together and see how good they're this jiff natural creamy peanut butter is low sodium it says no need to stir because you do with a lot of natural peanut butters you do have to separate yes peanut butter spread contains 90% peanuts 7 grams of protein per serving non-gmo gluten-free 14 servings are in the this container which is 1 pound 16 ounces 2 tablespoons is 190 count but the ingredients in it just just out of curiosity ingredients may well just be nice made from peanuts sugar palm oil contains 2% or less of salt and molasses coz we've seen the other peanut butter or butter natural canoers really just peanuts yes you know there's a recipe on the back of this marshmallow fluff for like marshmallow treats so it smells just like regular peanut butter Oh marshmallow this it it looks just like a regular peanut better what is it natural neighbor Cupido mm-hmm sometimes the natural peanut butters tastes more like just peanuts good it is it's not a sweet no it's not a sweet but it's still very very good mm-hmm it's very thick it's very very very thick very thick um okay I'm used to eating the powder painted better that you know so for me it's thank yeah that's pretty it's pretty thick anyway I mean that's a thick peanut butter okay so you think it's thicker and it is it's like sticky mess together I really like the flavor I don't taste it the peanuts are getting strong it's it's not I don't think it's a sweet as regular gym but I think that any time oh yeah yeah if it was less calories or whatever it's healthy it was fewer calories I would totally go for it but I have to stick with my powder because it's not fewer calories right and this one is the strawberry marshmallow fluff which is definitely not a lower calorie this is 2 tablespoons or are only 40 calories okay but it's very whipped up I mean it's huge tablespoons are 40 and 2 tablespoons are 190 so I mean that's that's a low calorie snack that is yeah really you can actually marry this marshmallow treats you take a jar of this and 3 tablespoons of margarine and it's the Rice Krispies cereal and make rice krispies treats basically out of it I don't know if there's anything else should I read about it no it says it is colored now with the vegetable juice instead these artificial colors it's using actual that's and it is like heaven is a very light container you touch those in you and you immediately get sticky SAP or you try to avoid touching all that your ears is meant to get sticky sticky I did that on purpose I gave him now marshmallow cream is very good enough it's very sticky and thick you can't really spread it I wonder how oh yeah this is good this looks softer Dunham's bread would not be my choice what does this print this on no way no I mean normally and I considered getting a Ritz cracker yeah Ritz cracker or something whatever I didn't want to because the a finger Ritz crackers are very buttery yeah yes this is a neutral thanks for that that's why cuz I don't have any fine crackers I can picture putting that in rice krispies oh yeah it's got a good strong gurgler so you want to trap with PML oh it together mm-hmm I think if that happened I'll get that I figured you want to try to be like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich this strawberry and then peanut butter all the tons let me get go a little lighter on this because it is so thick yeah I mean they'll mix with us at what yeah can you cut that out yeah the noisier is guido snoring I'm gonna have a wall animal wonder you know oh that's good though I like that that's a sweetness that peanut butter though mm-hmm it's kind of missing and then add that strawberry flavor yeah I like the strawberry flavor with it hmm that's a very good sandwich my mom I do hmm yeah that is a very good sandwich I predict that bought by the spoonfuls well I mean that's good it's deep it's very sticky peanut butter something you almost need a drink though that's very good mmm I like both of us yeah both of our oil I like both of them on their own I like them together I think that's a very very nice so to Sherry who was wondering about this if it was good peanut butter I can't go for it I would say forget it it's good peanut butter just not as super super sweet but you don't really need super super sweet peanut butter anyway and if you see this fluff I would totally get it what's your under the Christmas tree shops but I don't think fluff is I think just the regular fluff I think that's something that's more common in other parts of the country than here up here yeah we don't have flow so but if you see this I would get that out with Travis if you've never tried the strawberry Woodmoor yeah it's very very nice and it's good paired with your peanut butter so I hope you all enjoyed

haven't check out part one please go check it out so bye [Music] bye bye bye", "X4goQg0MaUo": "hi my name is Ashley rice and welcome to a YouTube channel okay guys today I'm going to share some different vegan marshmallow and marshmallow fluff brands that you can find in either the US or the UK I know there are some outside of the ones that I'm listing but they are smaller companies so I'm just not as aware of them but I know there are some smaller companies out there that might be more local in which case go support that and also share information about them down below in the comments because I would love to check them out as well I am going to show you some that I was able to find in my local area and then I'm going to talk about some that you can find in the UK that look amazing and I wish I could order them but the shipping is like so expensive and then also I'm going to talk about some other ones that I just couldn't get my hands on but you should be able to find in the US as well obviously I'm gonna mention the big vegan marshmallow brands that almost all vegans know about and that is gonna be dandies right here I actually started using dandies when I was vegetarian cuz I didn't do gelatin as a vegetarian and I'm obsessed with them they are my go-to vegan marshmallow brand is Dandy's here and so I got some mini ones that I'm going to be using in a recipe that's gonna be coming out next week I believe and I also got some big guys right here but dandies as a brand you're gonna be able to find out a lot of your local stores it is such a big one too this is the main one that I think is used by most vegans so I mean you're definitely gonna find a whole food some targets you're definitely gonna find it out we found some at Cub Foods which is awesome Walmart should carry them as well so you should be able to depending on how vegan-friendly your area is you should be able to find them in most stores near you and if you can't you can actually also order them off a thrive market if you do a subscription through them another one that you'll be able to find in a particular store is actually Trader Joe's they're marshmallows are vegan which is amazing they don't have gelatin and on which I absolutely love I think I've tried these once so I'm gonna be having a video coming out comparing dandies to Trader Joe's and we're going to be trying them in some s'mores I love the fact that Trader Joe's has vegan marshmallows it makes my heart's so happy and you should be able to find these at any Trader Joe's near you there are also some fun vegan marshmallows and I'm gonna talk about one brand right now but you can only find in the UK and I really really really wanted to get these because they had some really fun flavors to try out unfortunately shipping was just way too expensive and they were gonna arrive in time for this video so I thought yeah sometime later when I'm more well-off and I can order them I will and I will try them out for you guys because they look fan-freaking-tastic and that is gonna be the amyntas vanilla gelatin free marshmallows they have some different flavors I'm gonna leave links to all of these different brands down below in the description box so if you want to check out any of them you definitely can that way but this brand looked amazing so if you're in the UK like get them because they look fantastic and I can't wait for the day that I can try them because there were some yummy flavors another brand that I was looking at but I could only get one flavor and again they were gonna arrive in time for this video and I would like to get more than one flavor if I'm gonna buy them and you can get these on vegan essentials and those guys are the freedom confectionery marshmallows and they have a few different flavors that you check out as well so at some point I'm definitely going to order those and I'm gonna try them out for you guys because they look really really yummy and I don't know about you guys but I can't remember what the cereal is called but as a kid they were the ones that had the mini marshmallows in them and all I would eat was the mini marshmallows I actually found out there's a brand that carries the vegan versions of those and it is sweet and Sara dried cereal marshmallows that's the company and the product however I couldn't order those because they were all sold out which makes me so sad so at some point maybe I'll get those and I'll use it in like some homemade cereal recipe or something like that because they look amazing but now let's talk about marshmallow fluff I enjoy using marshmallow fluff on like dessert sandwiches or dessert wraps or something like that if I'm making like a wrap that has banana sometimes I put a little bit of marshmallow fluff on there and sometimes if I'm looking for like a dessert chai I'll just put like a layer of marshmallow fluff on the top not very good for me at all but it's delicious I can only find one brand in my area which makes me so sad because I'm so sure I've seen this other company that I'm about to talk about before and we just we couldn't find it anywhere near us at this point in time so the one brand that you'll be able to find is the susan's rice mellow cream and it is 100% vegan non-dairy gluten-free as well and when I looked it up it said that I would be able to find it in Whole Foods and there's some other stores as well but that was the one that I recognized out of their list so I'm hoping eventually I'll be able to find that guy but I wasn't able to find it for today's video which is so sad however I did find this one that I had no idea was just accidentally vegan and it makes me so happy and that is Smuckers right here it's just a marshmallow like ice cream topping that you can use and it's just marshmallow fluff and it just happens to be vegan which i think is amazing because I mean who would not have pinned Smuckers for having like a vegan marshmallow fluff toppings markers we found at our local Cub Foods I'm assuming you should be able to find this at stores that are similar to that maybe even Target and Walmart as well just because Smuckers is such a well-known brand and the other ones depending on where you located or what you're able to order from or if they're even in stock you should be able to order those other ones but hopefully this gives you a good starting point to finding some vegan marshmallow or marshmallow fluff in your area so that you can use it in a recipes or because it is summer for campfires when you are roasting marshmallows for s'mores because who doesn't love goods more but other than that I hope you liked this short sweet and simple video let me know in the comments below which of these you have tried or which ones you're most interested in trying and also if you know of any other companies that have it vegan rationals because I would love to check them out as well these were just the ones that I

last one but it was quite hard thank you for watching this video guys and as always be safe you're out", "RT8TM54AxpM": "hi everyone it's me Darlene my mother's little candy dish is empty that means it is time to whip up another concoction before I get into this one I'm going to put a playlist linked down below to my other concoctions and you can see why it is I do things the way I do it's because I like to just mix stuff together I don't measure I don't practice in advance I just like to experiment and we get to see together how it turns out I do plan on putting this in the freezer when it's done so that I can show you the final results at the end let's just hope I can make something this time she wants something made with her marshmallow fluff which is just 8 marshmallow cream obviously she wants some of her walnuts because she has that in everything we were going to include some of the little candies that I got her just yesterday when I was at Roger's but we decided not to because she is afraid it's going to take away from the flavor of the peanut butter that I have decided we have to use I was just going to mix marshmallow fluff with powdered sugar and add walnuts and see how that worked however I played with a little tiny bit of it in a cup I just wanted to see if I could get the marshmallow and confection at sugar powdered sugar to mix and I don't know if it would have ever hardened up so I put a little bit of peanut butter and this looks like it's a much better texture and not as sticky because the peanut butter has some oil in it so we're going with the peanut butter because of the peanut butter we're going to skip these candies for now one thing I thought of though is maybe adding some crushed graham crackers because that might be good give a little crunch but let's just start I'm using a smaller Bowl than usual because I just don't want the marshmallow to stick all around to the side of the bowl let's start by adding the get butter so let's do that and I think I'll add the marshmallow at this point and mix those two things together it's a fluffernutter candy get in there I gotta go wash my fingers let's just mix this I really like the texture of this I mean it feels good and I haven't even put the confection of sugar in yet all right I'm going to need more than that though so let's do a little bit more of this get in there I guess I'm just going to be dirtying a bunch of spoons and some more peanut butter okay let me chop some walnuts my handy dandy little chopper not too many good I might as well add that little bit that I made let that go to waste I think this might be good I'm going to start adding the powdered sugar I would say that this was pretty much equal parts of peanut butter and marshmallow fluff in case you're taking notes do I want to put some pieces of graham in there it would taste like when my mother used to make peanut butter and marshmallow graham sandwiches she actually used to freeze those and it was so good I could crush a gram in there I think I will and we'll put that in here chocolate chips would certainly be good but we don't have any M&Ms would be good too oh that's kind of a lot of graham that's alright you'll like it I think I'm going to use my hands my hands clean that I washed some days ago I just washed them oh I like the texture I really do okay let's start kneading in some powdered sugar starting to crumble a little bit so I'm going to get a couple drops of water I don't even know if that's a tablespoon oh yeah that was at least a tablespoon doesn't take much and if you put too much then you just add more powdered sugar the water dries don't ever mix oil into it because then it won't dry want to make this like cuttable like fudge if not then it's a candy that you eat with a spoon okay we need more powdered sugar now cuz that's the way it always happens I am calling this done now because there's the peanut butter there's enough oil that I do not expect it to stick but if I thought it would stick I could just put some powdered sugar in the bottom and I think we're good looks like I made just enough I think she's going to like the little crunch of grams in there I am going to the cover on her little candy dish that we have been using for her special confections and I'm going to put this in the freezer for about 30 minutes and then I will take it out and let it thaw for like a minute or two I will cut it hopefully it will cut I will show you be right back it's time to test this this has been in the freezer for a half an hour and I didn't let it thaw because I think this is probably going to be softer so I thought it would be easier to cut frozen did not stick not that bad let's cut it this way if it was sticky I was going to like roll it in some confectioner sugar but I don't think I'm going to have to that looks pretty good I wish the little pan was square and let's just cut that there it's certainly holding its shape it is you know going to be a little bit softer but to me it looks like perfect fudge so give it a try start with equal amounts of peanut butter and marshmallow fluff and then add whatever you want and then add some confectioner sugar until you can make a ball of dough and then just press it into any plate or any container and you have some fudge so thank you so much for watching I will be back with more soon bye my mother said this is by far her favorite batch yet she has always loved cooked peanut butter fudge that has marshmallow in the recipe and I don't like to make cooked fudge she said this tastes exactly like the cooked peanut butter fudge that she loved so much and she liked the graham in there she said that it's soft it's not crunchy she ate quite a bit of this fudge [Laughter] you", "KYgc5NEj7Co": "guys wait you know what is a quiet vlogs welcome to the video and we'll play hide and seek with my blood though and it seems like you ain't finding us and I'm hearing music outside

slime it's glittery marshmallow fluff and it's really unique has the recipe and the unusual glitter I'm really excited to show you guys the texture texture is amazing like it is crazy you guys won't believe it okay so it's like literally marshmallow fluff it is amazing see like it is perfect I mean it only has two ingredients so that's probably why it's not exactly the best line you could have but it's not the worst either it's far from worst way far way it's like really really I'm just gonna take this lotion and I'll put some in here come behold that I make so when I put it in the hole that created this line my lotion and then I'm just going to knead it and do this line and what it is is it is Model Magic clay with you guessed it lotion and I am excited to sell on it I'm excited to sell this one um it is and this this is just from me adding the lotion this isn't what the slime actually does so it's actually a really good slime once you get to start playing with it like I know it doesn't look like a good time but it is as long as you agree as long as you put it in the bag when you are done and this is kind of gonna be really expensive but that's only because um the amount of model magic clay I used was an entire bag of it and bags are like this big like almost there then they are taller than this bottle of lotion and if you look at it like in the right wave camera it is really tall and and so I used all of it in from the bag and then turned it into slime / putty so yeah that is what I did miss all of it and I'm not gonna be able to make more for a long while because I don't know when I'm getting more so just a heads up but if you want any and you actually have the money for it call me and let me know because this is limited edition it is a Christmas edition and if you do want some just comment below and then I will give you a price it's gonna be somewhere between five and seven dollars just sayin so I hope you guys enjoyed this video please like and

we're gonna go in and open my marshmallow fluff and I all remember these names so this one's my fluff it's still pretty good but it got like dried up so that made up really bad and I'm sad because it wasn't pretty good okay now we get hope pink eyeliner okay look looks like it so I'm here to tell you it feels like rosy sticky it is usually in your Bible it does really cute but it doesn't seem to be sticky yeah it's not sticky guys stuff it's not sticky it's a really small patch I came wrong the color is so disgusting no flat spot and realized it's beautiful maybe if I pull my shoe down that would happen because maybe that's what maybe I put a glob of orange it what I put in this election I think I made this on camera I'm not exactly sure I remember it now that I was getting more pink I'm wonderful Taylor pick on so much oh now to me it still seemed a cuddler that what ultimate still same color but when your life the color really changed like oh boy like oh my god I'm probably gonna bring this but okay I probably just it was it yesterday I don't find you hide me do orange Oh Thursday yeah Thursday we had orange sock there okay so it's kind of hard but I think it's a really lucky and stretchy oh my god can't watch on the stage that color pink eyeliner wasn't a camera no I promise it's not I promise it's not the same slime like the difference color I can't play my camera's neck I kind of wall zoom in but I don't want to pet peeve hit like a pet peeve is like when he's doing with everyone thinks uh someone configured on this kids you was just a tiny bit this doesn't sound like a beggar bigger why that zoom did I hopefully I'm sorry I have to I have it for you I feel like weird I can't look like I'm looking right now like comment and please be a member of this farm squad bye guys", "ukHKF0NS18A": "okay today I'm gonna make the things you'll need is glue I'm using Elmer's school glue shaving cream and baby powder you don't have to use it for a while I'm making I'm making marshmallow fluff huh first I'm going to add in some glue oh yeah I also have lotion a friend ends it I'm gonna add some water into here to get some glue out okay walk down here shake it up

Works okay now I'm going to stir it next is the baby powder I'm using Johnson's baby powder and that should be enough and now I'm going to stir it up and I'm gonna add some more shaping the cream because it's not really fluffy and it's marshmallow slime so I want it to be fluffy sorry I got some stuff on my hands now we're gonna add the activator I have pre-made in a small cup should be enough right now it's really sticky but I don't need to add any more activator because when I mix and it's not going to be this bad see it doesn't stick to me anymore sorry about my messy hands and I'm gonna add some more lunch into this and I'm going to mix that in sorry about the background noises I'm next to a window so you might be hearing stuff and there's construction so it looks so weird okay

reviewing this song I made yesterday and that I'm not sure now seriously oh my god you joking that doesn't matter I like another monster so he's paying for nice widespread porn I'm reviewing this matter yo she just went past me Bob I'm 21 now so I'm gonna be reviewing this massive slime it's about 10 ounce lime please hey this is a 10 ounce lime and it's cool I'm not sure for now you might call it and then this I made this last night it's 10 out it's a 10 ounce lime and it's very squishy I'm not it's not very stretchy cuz it will just break but it's nice it's very squishy and I'm not I do like to poke it so I'll be back in a minute and you'll I'll be down there on the mat and you can well I can review it properly okay so hi guys welcome back today we're not well we're back now on the Maxwell not the mat or on the whiteboard cuz I can't find them so that's not the man it's a massive mat that goes on so it's quite pokey she might be able to see babies children look it's really nice and pokey the TV's up there that if she ones your eyes looking up there so this slime is really good really really really good but it's it goes hard after a while all because you make it with oil flour I'm not sure else yeast but Washington's not hard it does have quite a nice texture to it because if it does ever go to sticky all you have to do is add more flour and I'll leave the the recipe in the description actually all I'll leave the website to the dip to the recipe into the description that I don't know I love all the discs that I'll have all the ingredients on it so you can make it yourself because it is it does this last a few days like maybe like a week you could this slime ass about a week before it just go hard and you couldn't you you couldn't have this for more than about two months because cutters flour and yeast in it it will go mouldy because it is food ingredients so my go bit moldy if you don't if you don't do them if you don't know what but it's quite easy to make wait there Ronnie's just gonna entertain lots of checks are you joking me so I guess really rubbish then but soon as I they come to the person he gets a scar okay so this video is not going to be that long traveling the shortest video I've ever done because there's not much to review on this slime because this is the only time I have at the minute because the other one got a bit hard I had three slimes actually below wants it hard this one is in their heart for a couple of days zero whiteness yo so we're loading a taught night video later so you'll be able to see what it's doing this step you have to stay tuned for a bit it's gonna be it won't be long before it's still gonna be uploaded on this is so squishy look I really got it slime but it's kind of hard to make because you need like from pound and if you wanted if you wanted to buy this the ingredients for the slabs and panel and it's probably gonna end up like five pounds cuz of Aldi and green actually no because I found an ingredient probably about seven pounds so you got to be aware of that you need warm water but it does turn out really good do you never felt it did not it's quite nice it does get it's kind of hard I need to color it I'm gonna color in a might be ugly me to get this high sets come to the about edge it comes nice always media it's come to I the end of this another video on my channel because there's nothing else to review on this line if you want to make this slide I will not begin a giveaway because you can make it yourself it's very easy you can make stuff so the wave you giveaway for this and I hope you've enjoyed this video if you don't just like it but I really hope you don't subscribe I hope you don't dislike it and then like please like subscribe thanks for watching on my

hope you've enjoyed thanks like Jenga", "8Y5WpOJO9CA": "what it do baby today i'm gonna be seeing if i can take down one dozen glazed krispy kreme donuts i got two packs of six right here fresh well hopefully they're fresh man i feel like the softer they are the better they are i can't really tell i don't really eat donuts too often you know i try to stay away from sweet foods as much as possible just because i mean the calorie ratio to filling this ratio just not just not hitting it for me i'll tell you what one box of these says it's a 1206 k calories so all together it's over 2400 i guess but um either way that's a lot of calories a lot of sugar in here and this cost me about 17 bucks or so like sweet food man that was with the coffee i'll give it that but man sweet food i'll tell you what i'll take i'll take a couple bites and my damn that's that's really nice but um yeah i ain't got no narwhal sweet tooth would it eventually i'll just hit a hit a real hard wall and uh and i'll go down like stonewall jackson man so anyway i'm not even sure if i can do this i got a timer here just in case but i'm not going to be challenging any top times i probably won't even be going top speed um probably be going about 80 to start off with at least but let's see what we can do i mean i'm just kind of genuinely curious to see what this is like so let's go for it yeah all right yo i thought that would be like soft and fluffy that's the denser i imagine damn it's gonna be tough so foreign this is terrible time should i go for a dunk i'll tell you what they are good though i want to show it sorry one or two of these is like really nice but should i dunk it i'm gonna try it [Applause] so i'm pretty sure i'm not starting to do this in like under a minute like 35 seconds or something which is insane that's so crazy that's just wild the eyes balcony [Applause] no jeez my news this is both harder than i thought and easier than i thought i don't care about the time at this point but like eating a singular donut like it's a lot more chewy what is this oil dripping down man jeez it's so uh it's it gets so dense like you take a couple bites as fluffy but as you chew it condenses into this like tough sugary mass it's quite hard to chew when you do the whole maybe i've been doing the technique wrong maybe i gotta [Applause] that being said let me try to go for five minutes [Applause] um [Applause] so ah tasty all right that's like somewhat respectable i guess i was gonna say it's like somewhat easier than i thought it would be just because i really didn't think i'd be able to do that i thought i would really start hitting the wall around halfway but uh i didn't i could even probably get a few more if i really wanted to uh and i could probably shave off some seconds but there it is you know at least i can say i've done it now man i can't even lie i'm not even feeling that bad right now i'm feeling pretty good to be honest with you i'm betting that will change in about an hour or so but anyway yeah if you want to challenge it 4 48 and there's my time and see what you can do anyway hope you guys enjoyed this one thank you for watching i'll catch you in the next video peace", "XlM9aEaQSyg": "ok so today I'm going to be making a peanut butter and marshmallow fluff sandwich paper I like my nature's own butter bread so first you start taking out two pieces of

single men out there how you doing anyways what are you whether you look for in your list ship um I look for just someone that supports my decisions in life because obviously you know I have plans for myself and either get with me or you don't know until you walk alongside me or you're following time and I just kick to the curb exist so um I look for someone that challenges me you know we me and my boyfriend we like I really he's a giant teddy bear we're really mean to each other but it's okay because we just challenged each other whence and we have to be on point all time and I know it's just I look for someone that's really funny and will get my weirdness I get your weirdness make any lesbian lovers oh my god i just became lesbian lovers you too is nothing wrong that we don't judge American this is my girlfriend hey hey done all right what do you look for I what do I look for as you can clearly see I am a little bit psychotic so I need someone you know can catch up with my speed you're such a penis on YouTube exactly and I have no shame in that no tea no shade call you drunk all you drag you racers or RuPaul Watchers tea no shade no tea no shade okay pause in for the male part t

to school and working a job and just trying to find my way in the world and i'm doing all by myself so I can just know get a little rhyme applause for myself right here hello and basically bottom line also this is my little little thing facial hair and tattoos are sexy guy say that just cause you can't grow that what's okay if you don't this Rogaine it you just put roguery about your yes I yeah and it's hair that's its skin whatever and you days it's okay cuz if you have really good tattoos she would love it has to be meaningful them not not like you know Rachel ex-girlfriend of like one day you know I've seen people with that missus cuffs don't even do em likes i don't even do it okay so anyways back to you have an example of relationships my dear friend who shall be nameless her she's going through her a little personal try right now she's only been going out with him for about six months now but for what relationship is it does it get like it's been like a year and a half basically because what you're saying that was like me it's just tough what happened it the story stars this the story is that it's kinda easy really depressed moment in his life right now and he doesn't know how to you know filter his anger and stuff so since she's the only one that seems you they are just kind of catching the tail end of everything Jean you know she's she's like getting neglected and you know um he's not like loving her like she should I mean she's basically doing everything a good support girlfriend should be like she's being there for him trying to talk to him you know show that like someone's actually they had to care for him and he's just like nope don't do that sorry you know I'm gonna have a drum a little pity party and I'm looking here are you looking here i'm looking here two all-stars that's where people looking into your eyes because I've been looking here don't work there I bet here anyways moving on yeah if your man abuses you leave that relationship I'm not even kidding you if if you feel threatened please leave you know call for help you know hotline we don't we don't want you guys to to be heard so but it's not an abuse though it's like what I meant it's like it's it's a neglecting thing but it took it to give it every relationship is a give-and-take type of thing if someone's just constantly giving them you know can be and completely vulnerable and giving their heart out to that person oh no other person it's just you know be like yeah okay whatever I mean the guy was so freaking nike no upset with his own so for valentine's day he didn't beginner it and he didn't like you know acknowledged to the day and say hey babe don't have any money sorry i couldnt get anything but happy valentine's day i love you i am thinking about he'd even do that it's like really you came and speak a few words your own girlfriend cuz you supposedly love her right yeah I swim if my guy I don't care if you have money or not as long as you just say you love me any of your thinking about me I'm cool with that but if you have an exciting it's gonna be you and me in the parking lot three o'clock be there so ho ho mush it hold on oh so no I've been there before you know I gave like a hundred ten percent to relationships and i only get back twenty percent you know you might say i love you but you don't actually like try to do anything so that's not fun but i mean like women like to be spoiled about her man if a true girl loves you she doesn't mind spoiling you but you're not a baby we shouldn't be happy you know we shouldn't have to tell you to do the dishes for a month and a half it's a thing we'll get we'll go wash dishes later but we shouldn't have to you know be basically being your mother your mother raised you you came out of her but JJ you didn't come on ours so Jeremiah called me his mother he he called her his mother he said that I was acting like his mother and I was like oh hell no we are not we are not your mother know your girlfriend's treat us like you actually care in love about is not the opposite to do knock your friends your mother's hectic some people don't know how long you need to know how your man treat your mom because he's gonna treat you the same way actually so there's that nothing else we love men we do we have no problem with oh well we do have problems with them but that's okay because they have tons of problem with us the point is though if you're really willing to work the relationship it will work but it's a give-and-take type of thing if it's meant to be it going to happen and if you're still looking for a guy stop looking it happened it will happen that's what i did i stop looking and then time will come there's people that just walk into my life also relationships if you know it's not if you've been in Lycia if it doesn't matter how long it's been if you know it's not working and even if you tried everything or they tried everything are you guys both driving together don't try to you know preserve it keep it like in a box and like duct tape in saran wrap it and staple it and glue surrender that's ghetto yeah that's that's good you're basically having a good relationship it's gonna fall apart so just let it fall apart yet it's gonna Dart fall apart just just leave it just leave in essence just go just leave the relationship and then take the time yourself pamper yourself up figure out what you want what you both need a bigger out your life yeah like okay I'm sorry I've been watching a lot of RuPaul's gonna quote it like like he always says if you can't love yourself how about hell are you gonna love someone else kind of any money amen amen okay hey men see ya it's sooner than the Bible yeah so but I mean we just we want everyone to be happy so because you know happiness we didn't give you any advice in this thing except for talking about relationships cuz we just like to talk we are yeah whoops okay so we're gonna go cuz this video's like eight

the courtesy to tell you when you get off I like that it's like you're a dumbass go here really appreciate that game oops I've been going here let's see okay what does this day some new trick hit the block to the right when an egg and some platform with flips some platforms and flip so you see that we do this it flips so now it's walkable but I kind of jumped into it we don't even keep we just need to jump in it so here do that now we need to get a red switch what is this war more dancing stars sweetheart come on come all right let's keep in the stem your shirt this growing kind of often this game doesn't follow you directly kind of you gonna need to do their part this parts important reason to hit it like that and we need to get that so you walk through here not jump into that we get

platforms Yoshi there we go perfect now we got the key open that door we head to the boss area oh not yet now this thing when you jump on it it goes the direction you stop that and we need to go up so

"DXH00pJ-buY": "guys Kevin here in Japan I'm at Sony Plaza which is an import shop in Japan and just proof that I've been abroad far too long guys I had no idea but there was such a thing as

to actually have to show Japanese people and people like Kevin what to do with this stuff no idea but that's why people are getting so big in America I guess", "IX-BlEmA7Iw": "hey guys let's go my again everyone is pretty there's video I'll be showing you how to make marshmallow fluff stop so let's just get into the video so first thing you need is something to mix in something and shaving cream in google and see activate so let's just get steak into this video so first thing you'll need to do is add some glue into your ball going to be either come out of it by the time i'm not using food color paint or anything cuz if it's much more fluff i'm gonna make it straight white so i'm not gonna use a lot of this it's not bad because i knew some--this good this isn't or max pick their nose is but oh don't really matter so i just add it not that much I mean my seem like a lot to you cuz it's more than just in bottle so i just edited this much so just go smooth there this girl is over thick some clue this group of course is already take just go to mix it next thing you'll be getting do is at some shake shake it up real good never enough so it can be my supply just gonna mix so you're just gonna add a little bit more that won't lie to be a puppet I just how much so after you do that you're going to take your slam it better to set this is borax solution just as soon as you add soon as you add in your activator it's just a clump clumping up immediately if it don't and if it don't take us more but at the sm more if it don't come up immediately I mean it's not working or you don't have the right after if you have Boris of course the story I'd do it but if you use detergent see you use the wrong detergent it's not going to flip up and it's not going to turn it just one and the good detergents to use are tight you could use the type powder the white tie n Pepa time this has to be the brand side and get you but it's only a spit of stuff was only one of the games which is it's not fabric softener well Pete is not bad but something cuz if you use fabrics and it is not gonna work hard to try the game turkey lon to Detective no fabric softener not the game records on the game laundry detergent and the bottle has to be clean and this item you're using the right one I'm just going to add a little more of my activator and just good you're just going to add a little bit more up to activator and the star clipper really well so I'm not to start needing it but you're not yet you have to wait it's a it clamps up and come all the way up for you so start to knead it in your hand so it's not all the way it's not out the way it's not out the way I'm sticky so I'm a little bit more step and as you can see you start to see it clip of the world cup flip up up up the bow and starting to come up but if you're still over 250 you've got add a little bit more of your solution so now mine is still a little sticky but I'm just going to start to meet it so I'm just going to take my little mix's tool and check all this line of it just dip that into the side sniffing we just go with that blew up today step aside we're going to take it out it's best to leave it it might be a little sticky as you meet put there if you just keep meeting it with your hands and playing with it it will turn it will not use the wolf not be sticky in mine is just a little bit sticky but that's fine just got to keep playing with it good jess is it does it so I don't even get still a little bit more sticky so what you can do is set your slide down on the table deflected spread it out take to your solution add two drops of it in the middle and succinate it some more and as you can see it's nuts sticky as it was now because I have add some more solution it is still a little sticky still stick it into my hands so I'm going to do is it the same thing again and I'm just going to spread it down onto my table and add two more drops a solution fold it and cook it and eat it up get it now after that as you can see it's not sticking to my hands anymore let's look at all of the slide on my hands so what I'm trying to do is I better take that off but it's still just a little bit sticky so if it's just a little bit sticky see you're just gonna this time you're just going to add just one more drop because it only needs one more jump because it sounds a little bit sticky let's one drop spread it around my store and just need it is the last one now my sign is that stick at all I'm just invisible and get all of my stuff off the ball and my marble is stained blue because making over 100k sum up all this thing it a little bit the boot if after my honey is it did you can see right now could you can see Amanda King a little bit yes stays blue makes a move so I'm just going to suck up all this line if a some around down it was another so cause the West I'll be right back I have to pump it so I'll be right back so guys I'm back and the last step is super motion and if you want your slime just no good you could use some scented lotion I just I'm just lotion the scent is this called Jackson mess and body works and just because um your own losha is a color it will not make your whites lime in color because it is Russia is not for coming for pimps a water or colored water so I'm just going to sprint this one out onto the table now I'm gonna open my lotion and 30 in the middle let's go spread better but I'm going to make that in the first one more stretch you need that into my slide and as you can see it didn't make it Pete stay playing what like I said it will now I'm just going to spread it out again all over the board a little more to the middle and I'm going to need it in a sorry about the background noise that's just the seat just stick it out there's now

"rb_FtoaieCY": "hello um Fritz yeah you've eaten all the marshmallow fluff oh but it is so delicious that was supposed to last us another 10 years we've already been down here for 30 I get so hungry I think you should eat something with nutritive value marshmallow fluff has no true to value me it has sugar which is a complex carbohydrate I I've been reading a lot lots of books all the books that we didn't burn there are three of them and one of them is on complex carbohydrate fortunate for you yeah I'm very educated now I practically have my daughter it and so dr. Fritz decided to look at the pantry and ignore all of the fruits and the vegetables and the meats and aunt all of the other things and concentrate solely on the marshmallow fluff who's the doctor here certainly not you I don't like it Sudama hmm that is because we do not have any more paper we ran out that's Tuesday you've used also paper now as well well I had to build a house of cards and it to have a house of cards and certainly unique cards we did not have cards so I use a paper to make cards and to make the house of cards out of them are you telling me we have real can't now no I'm saying we have a house of cards star together with marshmallow fluff so it does not fall apart you did not even eat the marshmallow fluff 9 is bad for you well you're not listening hello I'm so confused why why would you create cards which has it capability to entertain us yeah and then ruin them with a very limited food supply also ruining the food supply I am a fan of architecture or Fritz I can't stay mad at you it is true I mean that the house of cards is it's a force it's a tour de force it is as strong as this bunker the ones that I designs that we are currently in its hold strong for over 30 years of course it has held strong because there's no way in or out but still very strong very strong small small design flaws my design it was a it was a crazy time i would say ninety eight percent very good exactly two percent we have been very happy with doors or windows would have been nice but that's all right that's right we've been fine recycle their farts only lasts for 1 36 hours I wish you stop that it holds the sauerkraut in the worst when bottles butters lasts I mean sauerkraut you let it sit there and what would happen more vinegar it gets better with age it's good oh I have sauerkraut with everything why wouldn't you some people say it does not go this marshmallow fluff no it goes with marshmallow fluff absolutely I would need nothing else with marshmallow fluff but

marshmallow fluff oh I try to make it as best as I can I mean as good as I can what it takes it doesn't take that long so first what you are going to do is you done to denim marshmallow put it in a microwave-safe Bowl so I got it in my microwave safe Bowl I got my huge ones because I have your memories so what you're going to New in for this round here is microwave a spoon a bowl now I put it this on a 10 second or nine second increments what to do we're going to cover it with something a 30 second and exploding all over my just need to do this get down tonight I can implement or ten to nine I always flattering because women safe yarding I know it doesn't look like it but it was good like it's just gonna be a little here like it's going to be a little stickier and school here it's not going to believe that like hard anymore it's going to be a little school sheer then we're gonna do this you're the backing and my pillows in july second a little and then i'll be back so this is my second time doing it it went up a little more so you're going to just do is go get see if it's like creamy i get is now i'm going to take us kind of that's good warrior flop but we're not done yet i still have to do it a couple more times to make sure that it's good so i will be back when this is fully done now it's going to get messy in this process so what you're going to need to do is your spoons are gonna have to be like plastic or something because it will probably not really come off of your spoons that are metal whenever they make with those so yeah another tip if you want to use this again nazario fluff like for like cupcakes or something anything like that then you're going to have to eat if you put it in the draw you're gonna have to heat it up a little again before you do use it well I don't only know if it's Oreo fluff but I mean marshmallow fluff I place three more in my boom and almost ready here you go you got some yourself some laureate fluff and yeah i will be posting maybe later today because i'm not gonna have anything to do and plus one thing", "ck1qSVrWBtI": "ok peach", "Ai1Kc4A-Z48": "this recipe is brought to you by recipe lion calm nothing says the holidays are coming like a big batch of creamy chocolate fudge in the large heatproof bowl combine two sticks of softened butter a 5 ounce jar of marshmallow cream one teaspoon of vanilla and three cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips then set the bowl aside in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan combine four and a half cups of sugar and one can of evaporated milk with your heat on medium to medium-high stir constantly and bring the mixture to a boil as soon as it begins to bubble up turn the temperature down until it just barely simmers make sure you stir this constantly it burns easily and will begin sticking to the bottom of the pan set the timer for 10 minutes and keep stirring pour the hot sugar mixture over the chocolate chips and everything in the bowl stir it making sure everything is melting from the hot liquid and combines beat it hard for a few minutes until the fudge gets a beautiful shine this is where I always ask my husband for help because the longer and the harder you beat it the creamier it will be after it cools if you're going to add nuts to the fudge do it just before pouring it into your prepared pan some people chop their pecans or walnuts and some leave them whole whatever your preference is is fine pour the hot fudge into a buttered 9 inch by 13 inch baking dish cover it with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight until the fudge is completely cool and set use a sharp knife to slice into pieces to prevent the knife from sticking and tearing your slice dip it in hot water and it should slide right through thank you recipe line.com for

slime i will show you a little bit of my slime this is  fine but today we're just going to make a little time but see why we're making slime today yes so let's get straight into it ok so first we can you need a little cup and where'd the lid go oh my god lid ok there you are the lid the lid with a puff it attaches then you're going to need some baking soda not baking powder baking soda and contact solution any brand works even the cheaper ones this is your activator then you will need some lotion it does not matter what brand it just needs to be lotion [Music] and you also need it sorry you also need some glue okay so okay so let's get straight into this first you need to input to put open your glue and then you need to put a little bit here let's zoom in on this [Music] okay you need to pour in some glue [Music] oh and also you need this is Elmer's glue but you need any clue with NBA cool ppl in it and I'm just using clear blue it doesn't matter what Elmer soon you use it just need to the Elmer's glue and then you want to pour in just a little bit okay then you see that I have barely any girl in there and then you want to take your lotion and since i only did a little dip it low she make sure lotion I mean slime stretchier so let me just zoom out okay so then just going to add in a few pumps of this and you then what you want to do is you need to get a mixing tool which you can use the end of your little measuring thing and you want to mix this up and it should look like this and it still should kind of be like glue but its solution solution and glue and then using your TSP one-fourth teaspoon you ever so slightly you can you just for a little bit of slime now let's zoom in here you want to ever so slightly turn the tiniest amount baking soda you see oh okay focus I only put the tiniest amount in there you can't see it I'm really sorry about that but then you just want to mix it up it doesn't matter it's going to start to get thick and if it's not coming if it's not getting thicker then you can just add a little bit more glue so I'm just going to add the tiniest bit more room okay I me a little bit and then you want to mix that and then we're going to take your contact solution and you want to pour some in there like this and it's going to start coming together you only want to put in small amounts at a time and if it's still not coming together if it's just not slamming up you can add more baking soda because baking soda and this is a thickener so you just want to take this you want to mix it and you see how it's become thick well it's going to do that and then you're just going to keep mixing until until you feel like we're ready to meet it you want to add as less activator as you possibly can because you want to make it you see how mine is starting not to stick and it's becoming very slimy you wink when you can touch it and your finger comes out clean so your mind didn't mind didn't you just want to keep mixing do you see this you see how my fingers still six you want to just wipe that back in there and then you want to keep mixing and then you want to just keep stirring and stirring and you see that it's coming off this edges which is a good sign and then you want to just touch it again and if it's still not ready just keep mixing don't add more activator because I'll make it stiff and hard and at this stage you want to add just the time you just want to keep mixing and if it's still a little sticky oh no oh no okay you get back in there okay this is the this is the problem with making son a little messy okay then ever so slightly I'm just going to add rest of it you just want to add the tiniest bit of activator and it's going to come together like that and you just want to you can clean the best part about slime okay so okay so you see this stage right here where it's still sticky but like it's see this part you can pick it up you can see you see how how it's like super stretchy you just want to need it it does it's going to get a little messy that you want to need it you want to need it and your hands you just want to need it in your hands but I'm zooming out okay and then you just want to want to grab your slime like this and then you just want to need it it's going to be sticky because you know you're not done but don't do not add more activator it will make it hard and then it's not going to

fluff at marshmallows you may have seen on social media that I have been trying for a few days now to get to the popular marshmallow dessert shop I finally did and I picked up a few goodies ah today I'm gonna be trying the Reese's Pieces marshmallow treat it's dipped in Belgian chocolate has some peanut butter Reese's Pieces on it and the marshmallow itself it's not sticky when you touch it which is really nice it is a little a little flaky so that it doesn't stick to you and a mallow pie pretty traditional and then this is supposed to be the owners favorite dessert it's called a brownie bomb and it has cherry pie filling a brownie of course a marshmallow and then of course you have the bowl that it sits in so I am gonna dig in and kind of give you guys my opinion on what I think about it so I'm gonna try the crust really quick just rose like a cookie Frost there's pretty good you can definitely taste the burnt part well it's not burnt but like where they toasted the marshmallow inside because if you look at the dessert itself it's toasted here so they put the marshmallow in and then they toast it in the bowl itself so the cookie on it is pretty good I'm gonna try this little guy I'm not getting a whole lot of peanut butter it's good but I would like to see a little bit more peanut butter or that like peanut buttery Reese's Pieces taste that you get when you have Reese's Pieces at the movie theater I think that that would be a very welcome flavor to it the marshmallow itself is really good it's pretty fluffy I'm an area just like a traditional marshmallow would the marshmallow that they used with this is a vanilla marshmallow and it's really good so let's try the model pie now it's pretty good I think they've done a really great job of choosing a solid chocolate to go along with it and the only critique I have on this is that the cookie or the Joe that's inside along this bite of the mallow pie here that you can see it's a little cakey and like crumbly which is which is fine I don't mind it but for someone who doesn't like my retainer to get full of food I'm kind of like oh alright so now that have chocolate all over my hands let's try the owners favourite dish and see how it measures out a little bit of marshmallow a little difficult to get out and let's try the cherry alright and we'll top it off with some cookie so there you can see the bite right there the brownie is really good I love brownies marshmallow despite the fact that it was a little difficult to get out I did take this to go so I would assume that in store it would be a little easier to get out of the bowl but the cherry pie topping I'm not a huge fan of it and I do like cherry pie the filling itself is the cherry pie filling that is is pretty good but you kind of lose the cherry taste when you take a bite of the brownie and the cookie and the marshmallow and the chocolate drizzle that they put on top of it so I would have to say that I would get the brownie bomb without the cherry because you don't really get that cherry feeling when you feel the filling taste of when you're eating it it's more just the brownie bomb itself but other than that I mean it's pretty good I suggest going there and trying it there's definitely a lot more items on the menu that I haven't tried and I do plan to try so I'll keep you updated on that as well as their famous coffee drink so I'm sure Nikki will be hitting them up and tasting out one of those I'm a very traditional espresso kind of girl so thank you for watching me taste all this amazing food go check out fluff it and see what fluff it desert you want to try Thanks see you later", "LWcxN0Zf8nA": "hi guys and today I'm gonna be making matter not meeting making some white slime and because I'm gonna do a

"wSzPby-5iR0": "Hi, I'm Ashlee Marie. And today, we're making Truffle S'more pops. Don't forget to subscribe so you don't miss anything. And down below in the comment box, leave me a comment. What is your favorite thing to make on a cookout over a fire? Now, ganache is super simple. It is two ingredients, cream and chocolate. That's it. And the ratio is two parts chocolate to one part cream. Bring the whipping cream up to a simmer and pour it over your chocolate. Let this sit for 5 minutes, then stir the ganache until the chocolate and cream are fully incorporated and it's nice and smooth. Stick it in the fridge and chill it until it's nice and firm. You want to take a small cookie scoop and just like you're scooping ice cream, you want to scoop this truffle material and pull it out. Take it between your hands and roll it into a nice ball. Now, I keep a rag close by so I can wipe my fingers off. And what you're going to do now is take a lollipop stick and stick down inside that truffle. Alright, now, this truffle is nice and gooey and ooey and warm from our hands. So now, what you want to do is dip it into some crushed graham cracker. Pick the big chunks up. And set it aside. We're going to stick it in the fridge and let it chill. To make this version of marshmallow cr\u00e8me, we're going to take the egg whites and put them in a mixer. Add some cream of tarter. Cream of tarter helps when you're beating egg whites. And then, finally, we have some sugar. Now, we're going to start beating these and once it gets white and fluffy and starts to get foamy and creamy, we're going to carefully add the granulated sugar a little bit at a time. And you want to keep beating that until it gets soft peaks. Now, we're going to make the syrup mixture. So, we have sugar and water. And you can make your own syrup with sugar and water, but I also like to use some light corn syrup. Now, I want to take the sugar just past soft ball stage, which is 240. Then, we want to take it to kind of a firm but not all the way to hard ball. So I'm going for 245. Now remember, that's a sea level measurement. So if you live at sea level, go all the way to 245. You'll be great. Now, I live way up in the mountains. So, I have to adjust the candy thermometer temperature to meet my altitude. So with as high up as I am, I knock off 20 degrees. Alright, our sugar is now up to the correct temperature. It's nice and thick and ready to add to our egg whites. We're going to turn the mixer on low and we're going to add the sugar in a slow stream which this beats. Once the sugar is all added, we're going to turn it up to high, add vanilla, and then whip it until it's the right texture. Alright. And there you have it. Homemade marshmallow cr\u00e8me. Now, take your chocolate ganache topped with graham crackers, and your homemade marshmallow cr\u00e8me or frosting and dip it in and swirl it to cover it, and swirl it as you pull it out. Then you want to take a torch and turn it on. Leave it on continuous. And then torch your pop. Getting all sides. And we're done. They look great. They smell great. I've always loved the smell of roasted marshmallows. In the description box down below, you'll find the recipes for the truffles, as well as the marshmallow cr\u00e8me. Time to give these a try. Toasted marshmallow, soft ganache- rich and soft, the marshmallow is still nice and melty and ooey and gooey, and just like a marshmallow should be. It's really rich with that truffle center.\n43\n00:03:58,223 --> 00:00:00,000\nIt's totally delicious and everybody is going to love these. Thanks for watching.", "8KedZdF0NSo": "- Hi, I'm Sally from\nSally's Baking Addiction and today I'm showing you how to make homemade marshmallow cream,\na four-ingredient combination that I love to use in\ns'mores baked treats, as a frosting on Baked\nAlaska, and so much more. In terms of preparation, it's close to Swiss meringue buttercream, only without the actual buttercream. It tastes like melted\nmarshmallows and is delicious when toasted with a kitchen torch. Combine egg whites, granulated\nsugar, and cream of tartar together on the stove, then whisk until the sugar has dissolved. You can test its doneness with\nan instant-read thermometer. After that, add vanilla extract and then beat until stiff peaks form. You can find this full recipe on my blog, SallysBakingAddiction.com. (upbeat music) Thank you so much for watching.

Homemade marshmallow recipes often contain\ncorn syrup, which is not widely available. So I\u2019m going to show you how you can make\nfluffy homemade marshmallows with no corn syrup, and I\u2019m going to show you how you\ncan make them vegan. It\u2019s really easy. We\u2019re going to start out in a little bowl. Add in some water, and sprinkle over some\npowdered gelatin. Once you have sprinkled it, give it a stir\nall together. So we\u2019re just going to set this aside and\nlet this set. It will take around ten minutes, and it will\nbecome nice and firm. So if you are vegan or if you don\u2019t want\nto use gelatin, you can always replace the gelatin with the same amount of powdered agar\nagar; that works really well. If you have agar flakes, that is a different\nquantity, and I\u2019m going to put that information on my website, so you can read through what\nworks for you. So in a heavy-bottom saucepan, we\u2019re going\nto add in our water, and our sugar. Now, for marshmallows, it is best that you\nuse plain, white sugar. It\u2019s not a good idea if you substitute out\nthis sugar. Just turn on your heat, really, really low,\nand you just want to let this sugar dissolve. We don\u2019t want it to simmer yet. At this stage, feel free to stir your sugar. Once your sugar has dissolved, and there are\nno more grains, we are going to add in our firm gelatin. And we\u2019re just going to stir this until\nit dissolves. Once our gelatin has dissolved, we are going\nto take out our spatula, and after this, there is no more stirring once we take out the spatula,\nbecause we are going to put in a candy thermometer. Now a candy thermometer is really important\nfor this recipe because we need precision. We need to get it to 240o Fahrenheit, which\nis \u201csoft ball stage,\u201d so it\u2019s really, really important to yield you lovely, fluffy\nmarshmallows at the end, so I\u2019m going to put a link on my website, BiggerBolderBaking.com,\nthe recipe for the marshmallows, and where you can buy these. They\u2019re actually really inexpensive. And they\u2019re really handy. So just clip it on to the side of your pot,\nand we\u2019re going to turn up the heat and bring this mix to a simmer. We just want a gentle, controlled simmer. And we\u2019re not going to stir it, we\u2019re\njust going to leave it be until it comes to 240 degrees. Being in control in a kitchen is really important,\nwhether you\u2019re making caramels, candy, marshmallows, whatever it is, so just keep an eye on your\nheat, and be in control of how high and how low it is. So this mix is simmering perfectly. I want your mix to look like this as well. So it has been simmering for quite a while\nnow. It does take a bit of time. But you see the way it\u2019s hanging around\n220 or so? It does that for quite a while before it reaches\na point, and then it will get to 240, so hold your nerve, and it\u2019ll get there! Okay, great! So we\u2019ve reached soft ball stage. So we\u2019re going to turn off the heat, and\ncarefully take out the candy thermometer. So I\u2019m going to put on some oven gloves,\nand I\u2019m going to move it off the heat. Take very good care when you\u2019re doing this. Have your Kitchenaid ready, and pour the hot\nsugar mix, straight into the bowl. Into this mix we\u2019re going to add in a little\nbit of vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. Put on your whisk attachment, and now we\u2019re\ngoing to turn on our machine onto a low speed, and we\u2019re going to whip it up for two minutes. So after the two minutes, I\u2019m going to turn\nthe machine up to high speed, and we\u2019re going to whip it up until this mix has almost\ntripled in size and it\u2019s lovely and soft. While your marshmallows are mixing, we are\ngoing to prepare our tray. So line your tray with some parchment, and\nthen brush it with some flavorless oil, like vegetable oil, sunflower oil\u2026 and then give\nit a generous dusting of icing sugar. This will prevent your marshmallows from sticking\nto your tray. So our marshmallows are done. Look at that\u2014it looks great. Scrape it out of the bowl and onto your tray. Once your marshmallows are spread out, we\nare going to dust the top with icing sugar. So what you want to do is let it sit out and\nroom temperature for three hours, and that will form a skin on top of your marshmallows. Once the three hours is up, flip your marshmallows,\nand then dust again with icing sugar. Let this sit out again for another three hours,\nand then we\u2019re ready to cut. Cut your marshmallows into any shape that\nyou like. As you can see, our homemade marshmallows\nare lovely and squishy. They do have a little bit of a different texture\nto store-bought, but they\u2019re still delicious. Store your marshmallows in an airtight container\nat room temperature for up to six weeks.

and welcome to Bold Baking Basics. This\nis where we get stuck into the fundamentals of baking. These videos are about getting\nyou to bake with confidence, anytime, anywhere. Corn syrup is a really common ingredient in\nthe United States, however growing up in Ireland if I saw it in a recipe I knew I couldn't\nmake it. In this video I am gonna show you how you can make a corn syrup substitute.\nAs always, the recipe can be found on BiggerBolderBaking.com along with lots more information about corn\nsyrup so make sure you check that out. Okay, let's get started in a nice heavy-bottomed\nsaucepan. Add in your water, sugar, pinch of salt, lemon juice, and lastly, cream of\ntartar. Okay so cream of tartar, let me tell you why this is a really important ingredient\nin here. It stops your corn syrup from crystallizing over time. So you want to have that in there\nfor sure. You can buy it really easily online or you can buy it in supermarkets. I strongly\nsuggest you have some in your cupboard because I do use it every so often. And that's it,\nthat's all you need to make a corn syrup substitute. So now what I'm gonna do is turn the heat\non to medium and then just wait until your sugar dissolves. So just as I'm stirring it\nhere I can see that all the sugar is dissolved, this is the perfect time to now let this mix\ncome to a simmer. So turn up the heat if you need to, and now we\u2019re gonna let this bubble\naway for around 15-20 minutes until we get a nice thick syrup. So now the reason that\nthis is a corn syrup substitute and not actual corn syrup is because corn syrup is made from\ncorn, this is a substitute, it still works really well, it\u2019s just a different method.\nSo now if you don't want to make your own corn syrup you can buy different substitutes,\nlike rice syrup and golden syrup. I\u2019ve got all that information on my website. So at\nthis stage just be patient, let it simmer away gently, I'm going to show you the telltale\nsigns that you're looking for to know that it\u2019s ready. So like I said it'll take around\n15-20 minutes, you'll notice that it is getting quite syrupy and it reduced down a lot, let\nme show you how you can tell that it\u2019s done. If you put in a spatula or a wooden spoon,\nand it drops off really slowly and it starts to kind of almost form a line, it\u2019s getting\nthicker and thicker, that's how you know when it\u2019s done. Perfect, it\u2019s slowly coming\noff your spatula. That means that when you turn it off the heat and it goes cold, it\u2019ll\nbecome even thicker. Okay so it looks like it\u2019s ready, I'm gonna turn it off the heat,\npush it over to the side, and just wait for it to cool down. So if you want to be really\nprecise with this recipe, you can put in a candy thermometer and once it reaches 230\u00baF,\nit\u2019s ready to go. So my corn syrup has cooled down, now all I'm going to do is just pour\nit into my jar. You can store it in whatever you like. Look you can see already how thick\nit\u2019s getting. So there you go, corn syrup substitute. Now you'll be happy to know that\nthis guy will live in your cupboard at room temperature for around 3 months. And I'm gonna\ntell you a little secret. I made this before and it did crystallize on me after a few weeks,\nso here's what you want to do. Pop it into the microwave, get it nice and hot, and those\nsugar crystals will dissolve and it will be ready to go again. Just so you know, this\nyields you around 1 \u2153 cup of corn syrup, or around 400g. Head over to my website for\ntons of recipes including ones where you can use my corn syrup in.

gonna use a cup my family does not like nuts I don't like a lot of nuts I like a little bit the recipe calls for one cup I am using less than that I'll comment I won't even measure it I'll just fill it out but for the sake of the recipe you need 1 cup and you've also need a 9 inch square baking tray I do not have a 9 inch I'm using an 8 inch I started to get a disposable one but I thought I had a 9 inch at home and I was wrong so we're gonna be using this right now and she's already over here measuring out ingredients but the first thing that I'm going to do is wanna line this with foil so that's the first thing one do right now I'm smile - pan [Applause] and you know in this house we don't use really any good foil for cooking what the good old nonstick [Music] you're gonna actually take two pieces and then crisscross them like that there's probably what I should have done but that's not what I did I did it this way Oh what you could do it that way I'm not wasting any for you yeah bad work it's lined oh wow no she's now put a tearing like I was they asking for something happen right so what look down in the bottom shelf and get that sauce pan hot and put that second I'm struggling so we're going to start not good ingredients in there I'm just gonna give her her instructions so that's the first thing you're going to do you're gonna put the butter in you're gonna let that melt and you're gonna put the sugar in and then you're gonna put the milk in okay those are the first three things and you're gonna bring it to a boil sky come to a rolling voice so she can do that we'll set our pan over here I'll wait for that to melt and she'll get that open should be done so yeah so what we're going to do is we're going to be constantly staring these guys because we don't want the sugar to burn and we're going to bring the temperature of that mixture to 234 degrees so that's going to be about four minutes once it starts boiling or a milky anything I thought that butter star brown and then concerning to this is a good time guys to take your thermometer alright let me as we started pasta okay alright I'll do that let me put them all going in so this needs to be stirred constantly  and we're gonna do this and there's a thermometer you see today at part they're passing us they're almost like this for four minutes [Music] meantime let's go down a little bit huh that's hot - B - how I just need that stick oh boy oh boy alright while she's doing that waiting at the monitor to move up to the correct temperature you got to change this battery boy temperature at almost be right - it's moving toward 220 it's about just getting there Thomas it's almost ready look like rocker moving into so once this reaches the correct temperature guys we're going to remove it I'm gonna turn heat down a little bit we'll remove this from the heat and then we will add our marshmallow fluff and our chocolate but it's not quite it's just about there's just a little little more to go and then we'll be there temperature-wise I'm gonna take a big bite okay start up in the chocolate is that's going in here it's not all nice and frothing guys look at that [Applause] okay alright we're about there so I'm gonna turn this off and put the chocolate in and fluff so all right you come in here and start dropping the chocolate in here all right break it up good you have to all three bars in you let that melt in your sugar for a second I'm gonna open this flow where she can open the floor you just keep staring into this all melty I'm Nettie it's all three okay open this fluff marshmallow fuel if you call the toughest marshmallow fluff all right here oh yeah can't even wait here yeah but I can't like literally right you can't Vicki so don't say stick like marshmallows but anyway you need to be stirring this just needs to get stirred and hold the hand of a stir alright I am going to get a full and I want to start dropping this fluff in here just get all the fluffy in the Navy stir this the marshmallow fluff guy make it quite full of it I almost threw the whole container in there don't know me on the strength all right get that fluff in there all right let me set up now I'm gonna start is until it's well mixed and then we'll add that tablespoon of vanilla and some of the want us and then going to pour this into the tray Lucky's mine doesn't taste like that except this time yeah you can actually eat it so guys you're going to stare this into a chocolate and the vanilla cream is I mean the fluff is all melted and then it'll uniform on its own it makes the NZ hard to start she gave me some good bits turn again need you know is it getting harder or just regular alright that looks nice and uniform okay so take um get your vanilla flavoring you might have some open up here already huh you should put one teaspoon of Danny and then we'll put the nuts in okay stir mmm that smells great doesn't it you should do that again legs thank you ah just make the snail water your nostrils all right you keep stirring it opening those walnuts and put a little walnut almost done guys had not been saying that the whole video that I'm gonna put a lot of walnuts in we have to make the dump cake or something with the recipes though why missing explicitly all right so all right so I put that much moat really started it gonna put the brakes on put the stop sign stop handsome you up alright does that mix them well enough you think alright so now we'll come over here talk straight and we will pour it into a tree oh it's all looking it's just running in didn't even really have to do anything look ahead you have to scrape it stiff fluff it's the fluff okay yes like clean guys this is gonna be easy to wash okay so basically guys now that that's that you let this sit until it cools off completely and then you can slice it and eat it then you have a fudge so we'll be back when that is all set and then I'll slice a couple of pieces of chalk really guys this is the finished product Aaron stole the chunk of my footage already how was it okay so that's the chunk that he stole but that's the finished product guy so likes it even taste it dad can't so I'm guessing he wants to stop by to some work to try some so let me call him it what are you late guys you know what to do thumbs up see you in the next video see you in the next video let me know if you try this recipe", "R4NveeUi8-8": "statistic Americans consume more than 90 million pounds of marshmallows a year Jim Douglas oh that may do it in the summertime either what s'mores are roasting it on a stick and Dan Koehler's here says there's a science there is there's a science behind everything there is but have you ever even thought about the word marshmallow because I think a lot of us it's it's strange word isn't it yeah yeah and where does this thing come from well actually if you split the word in half we can find the origin of this really spongy treat so there's a flower called the mallow and we've got a picture of this and this mallow flower grows in marshy areas it is in fact the a marsh mallow flower now inside this stem and inside the root there's this really thick SAP so in 300 BC in Egypt they whipped this sap with honey and they made a treat for the royalty and this actually is the beginning of what we would call a marshmallow and it comes from this family of candy that includes actually jello nougat taffy and then and we've got our favorite marshmallow here and I want to show you guys how how to make these at half walk us through it so easy so we came in early today to do this I got some tape about this it's a lot of fun the first thing I want to do is bloom some gelatin and the reason I'm doing this is so that all of those gelatin granules equally absorb water you don't want to get any clumps there then we're heating the sugar and I'm bringing this up with some water a little bit of corn syrup and a pinch of salt bringing this up to 240 degrees and the reason we go to 240 degrees that's called soft ball stage where the water is cooked out enough that the sugar is super concentrated and we can get the perfect texture out of our marshmallows at the end up next it's the easiest you just start beating that gelatin with the hot sugar and I swear you're gonna look at that and think there's no way that will I ever turn into Martha I bought hot seat you're all amazing as long as I was it takes about 15 minutes of beating but actually what you're doing there is you're beating all of this air into a protein structure the next thing you have to do empty it into a pan I've lined it with little cooking spray and parchment paper smooth it out use a little water on your spatula get a nice smooth top that's it that is marginal and that's marshmallow fluff there though yeah this is this is what we ended with at the end now I said a little bit there that it's a protein structure right now the sap from that marshmallow confectioner's found out was really highly concentrated with protein so as confectioner's started figuring that out they said what else can I make marshmallows with and first it went to egg whites and then it went to gelatin we've got a picture of a protein strands so gelatin is a very strong protein and then we've got a picture of a marshmallow under a microscope and what happens here is those protein strands really bond together and they trap air you saw over 15 minutes right looks like the craters on them it does we had 15 minutes of beating because what you want is to actually trap air between protein molecules now the last thing you'll either have a question go for it why aren't we eating them oh wait you got that coffee birthday cake and vanilla whey okay so while you're taking that out explain to me how you get the flavors in these yeah so the different flavors you want to use a couple of different methods for the coffee i actually bloom my gelatin in some instant freeze-dried coffee for the birthday cake i use almond extract instead of vanilla and the the plain vanilla marshmallows are really just a tablespoon of vanilla in there will you explain to everybody what blooming is if they don't know at home yes blooming is the process by which you hydrolyze gelatin so what happens there we sprinkle that gelatin over water and those granules absorb water and we do that to get it very even if you don't do it if you don't give it about 10 minutes what you end up with are really chunky clumps of gelatin and you don't want that at all now you can see I let this set for about four hours I'm coating it in a mixture of cornstarch and powdered sugar and that's where it gets that sort of chocolates Ricky yeah that's silky chalky feeling and guys this is ash a marshmallow that's all it is that's it ah last question what came first the chick are the marshmallow mark we don't have time for that today pinterest page go to renegade kitchen calm you're gonna find out all sorts
