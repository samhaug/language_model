{"AORyULfIRe0": "yo yo yo what's good youtube welcome to another live stream i'm going to raise you up just a bit sweet so gopro updated and um my new wi-fi router is in we're showing signal strength here for the stream decent it didn't show that before so now that's pretty good to see anyways let me go ahead and share the link out to instagram and we're going to go ahead and get started uh all right cool well glad we got that up and running let me go ahead and uh get this stream up on my computer oh you're right let's see i'm sure you guys want to see some of this stuff that i have here before we even get started right let me show you what we got going on first of all we weighed everything out earlier we uh pulled it out of the freeze dryer fresh this morning fat fat nineteen point four percent yield killed it one thousand one hundred and thirty grams of nug went in 220 grams of full spectrum hash came out as well as 19 grams of 25 and 160 micron so this is our test press that we use for edibles and then we'll go ahead and press out the rest of these full spectrum pucks i loaded them by hand into the bags and then after putting them in the bags i pressed them down in a rosin evolution pre-press to make sure that they stayed nice and tight and they are evenly distributed went up from uh the small little four ounce jars and uh upgraded to the six ounce jars i got tired of filling those little small ones to the brim and i said it's time to upgrade baby so we got the jar all weighed out we'll be able to weigh this when we're done tonight and see what our final yield was on this run now i'm a big fan of doing my presses a little bit warmer than what most people would i'm using my stool for you guys today so i'm gonna do this but um yeah you guys that watch me often know i will press anywhere from 200 to 225 depending on the cultivar depending on the hash um not all hash comes out the same um for example we talked about trichome density before right we talked about just because it looks like a lot of hash it may not be a lot of hash because um the oil inside may not be full you know what i'm saying the trichome may just be partially full in that case it's fluffy hash where it looks like a lot but it doesn't weigh a lot that's why this 25 micron and this 160 micron it looks like a large puck but it only weighs 19 grams compared to this puck which is smaller in comparison by about a centimeter right and it's not as fat but it weighs more probably about five to six grams more and that's because this is the full spectrum 45 through the 159 which contains higher density trichomes that are full of milk oil compared to the 25 and 160. so just a little throw that in there for you interior genetics what's going on asteroid farms if you guys aren't following asteroid farms on instagram go follow so old homie of mine platinum grove colorado who used to have a really pimp-ass girl room the nasa lab right um one of the inspirations for me initially stepping up my garden well now it's his turn to come back and he just got a brand new house with a nice ass basement and guess what it's time for a brand new build out so we're gonna help each other out take some ideas off of each other and i'm basically gonna have him record the whole thing and um show you guys how he does his build out you know and he'll give you guys pointers along the way and uh you know show you how to build a grow room so by the time you know he's done with that uh build out i'll be done uploading my video on how when i built out my grow room and uh his will be pretty much part two of a series that i'm going to be doing where it's going to be either build-outs brand new or remodels or upgrades and you guys will be able to pay for each episode um individually and absorb all the information that went into that whole build or remodel so it was actually his idea and we're gonna do his build out as episode two so it's gonna be awesome it's gonna have amazing information in there and it's gonna be great for you guys because instead of just seeing my room all the time and you're like oh that's great but not everybody has your room like yours or not everybody has a layout like yours you'll get to see different layouts different places different um climates right you're gonna get to see it all and you're gonna get to see the different thought process that goes into building these so it's gonna be really cool but anyways go check out his instagram because he's already started posting updates on it and it's not often that you get to jump on board and watch it build out brand new from the start most of the time you hop in and it's like uh the person's halfway done they've already done a bunch of [ __ ] you kind of like feel like the new guy you know what i'm saying in a crowd of old guys that been around for a long time now's your chance to get in on the bottom floor be one of those old guys he's been there forever by the time he gets done finishing you could be like i was there when you were still drawing the blueprints yo whippersnapper some of this blue icy and then i'm going to glove up the press is set to 175. we're going to do a low temp press on our test bag it's not going to be a clear indication of how the full spectrum is going to respond but it's going to give me a good enough idea to know whether or not 175 is going to provide the flow i'm looking for or if i'm going to need to go up to my 204 temperature 202 maybe i will put a link up right now i'm not sure that you guys can do it that's what's up jinder mah what's up dude i haven't seen you in forever holy moly so yeah check out asteroid farms what's going on viper what's up slug upstate what's going on we're just giving everybody a minute to trickle on in taking dabs we're enjoying life i haven't even taken a dab with you guys yet have i ah let's take a dab i'm gonna go in on some of this blue icy first oh let's get in there who wants to get in those guts with me we've got 31 left on this battery oh let's get in there the gopro doesn't focus well close up so you guys are gonna take what you get and be happy all right first time catching a live stream viper you caught a very good live stream for your first live stream this whole live stream i've already prepped all my parchment i prepped all my bags normally i'm not this prepped normally i still have full parchment and [ __ ] i wiped down the plates i'm ready to go baby it's waiting on you guys i mean what do you think we're about to press a half pound of hash a half pound cheers at 413 on the email okay ah that blue icy i swear on the exhale it tastes just like a blue icy it is so crazy every time it never fails what's up easy labs green ranger nashville how you doing freshly pressed what's up annie oh gee what's up hidden creek we got the whole [ __ ] family here i think i'm gonna do a live stream prank and start a live stream pressing hash with the hair straightener so we can get a million people asking oh no what happened did the press break fantastic so huh all righty all righty all righty let's swap out the battery you already know we got it we gotta swap out the battery we don't want it to die it'll be another short live stream i had to find it i couldn't forget i couldn't remember where the [ __ ] i put it down now i can't remember which batteries are charged now let's see lucky number nothing they'd be lying sometimes you got to pull them out and pop them back in they're not lying tonight [ __ ] [ __ ] well one of you's got to be higher than 25 [ __ ] percent let's find out i i don't feel comfortable knowing i've got 25 percent left on the battery i just took a fat ass dab and i'm about to start pressing i'm gonna get excited forget and this is gonna die by the way if the stream does go down unexpectedly please stay tuned because i will bring it right back up this is a non-stop party tonight that battery was at 100 you [ __ ] lying ass charger all right all right so for those of you that are new here i do a [ __ ] ton in a very small space so this is where i'm going to be collecting at when i'm all done here okay we're gonna move some [ __ ] out of the way shout out to roz and inc i want you guys to look at something real close here custom product for who that is who has bags like that who has bags like that do you want to know why he carries these two and a half by four and a half bags hey cuz of me baby who wants some bags i know some of you press and some of you need some bags all right anyways we've got parchment laid out we've got our bags ready to go okay and here you guys are going to go you're going to go right here look at that just for you how's that view yeah you could just chill set you down now is a good time if you got to use the restroom you got to go grab a drink you know what i'm saying whatever you got to do go handle that let me figure out this lighting i don't want it to be too bright for you guys oh [ __ ] that's too bright all right i feel good about this you guys are ordering from rosin inc make sure you guys use my coupon codes they're on my site solventlessbnb.com let's get ready get up there get up there just a little love from my homie right there you know all right remember you guys we're gonna be doing the 160 micron and the 25 micron mixed together as a test press before we move on to the full spectrum presses here we have the uh [ __ ] puck come on turn on screen doesn't recognize my gloves oh well anyways i hope that you guys were able to see that now this uh this is just some uh edibles mix of some uh the last strain that i pressed out which is the grape cosby little dark but it is [ __ ] chirpy and delicious and it will do amazing for edibles because the flavor that it will add is not too over the top but it's definitely like you notice it notice it so we're going to drip this into that edibles jar this is probably not going to flow crazy this is a test press a low temp test press at 175 all right i honestly feel like i should go up a little so so so so oh that looks like it's gonna be good well i think i found the temperature i'm gonna try for the first full spectrum maybe it'll flow a little bit more i'll take it for edibles siezer um don't worry that was just a plate on top of the press jumping around my cold plate up there good extraction well the flow was okay wasn't quite what i want it's kind of a weird flow so all right well not quite what i'm looking for believe it or not 185 that's gonna give me that awkward drip i'm gonna hold pull my audience to see what you guys think the temperature is that i'm gonna go with i already know what i'm going with i'm gonna go with uh my usual all right well we're gonna go ahead and do the first full uh spec press now all the same size that one was at 175. small bag we'll do this one first oh jesus 224 no too high 202 202 202 that's that's where i'm feeling 202 today i can feel it in my huevos rancheros pressing some cool spectrum once cash baby all right the room temperature is 74 degrees i do not believe in running a cold room during the pressing stage now bear with me you guys this is going to be a tad bit awkward as i have to deal with not only the um press this new jar which is larger and doesn't sit on the edge so i have to hold it like this in fact i don't even know what your viewpoint is now does that make sense right there where it's at for you guys i mean all right here we go we're at 191.1 191.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 six that's how slow my press heats up i love it i don't care what anybody says it doesn't overshoot temperatures during pressing because it sleeps it heats up slowly it doesn't like jump up all crazy because it has some overpowered 150 to 200 watt heaters it just has two 100 watt heaters nicely spaced out let's take a dab again next time tomorrow it sounds delicious this [ __ ] is like caramel taffy uh oh uh oh ah excuse me i felt like my nose was gonna run all over camera i didn't want that oh yeah what's up mommy my [ __ ] that'll do good that'll do oh that gets the job done i'll tell you what how you guys feeling about this prize we're at 199.7 199.7.8.9 200. 201 i'm not there and dad just [ __ ] knock me on my ass about let's get ready to remove look at that still plenty of paper towel left to clean bangers with throw that away save that puffing my man it's a good night when my boy puffin comes to visit you're pressing yourself right now huh hell yeah get it dog we are warmed up to 202 degrees let's go this is gonna be a second test press slightly lower than my normal but for some reason i'm feeling this temperature why i saw gonza say 204 and i'm like yeah yeah that's my normal i feel it but then all of a sudden my balls rumbled and spoke to me from deep within and they said no 202 now they're all right [ __ ] it the balls haven't lied yet oh what would you look at that there already me gusta come here come to daddy a little [ __ ] go what i say i knew it i felt it i felt it in my huevos rancheros oh yeah let's get messy somebody's got to make a meme out of the next big bag that squirts all over this jar so i'm feeling good about that that's a fish grab that and we're gonna move this over here i'll turn you right now 202 my [ __ ] i want to know did i get it all did i oh man that was a beautiful extraction 202 good job balls sometimes it's in your brains sometimes it's in your balls tonight it was in my balls oh check your insta i just saw you let me see let's let's see what am i checking your story i don't know maybe i jumped in at the wrong part of that conversation oh elevated uh nah there wasn't a lot on the parchment there was barely anything in here really maybe like two to three grams that was a small piece of uh that was small and that was 19 grams in there and uh [ __ ] dude not a lot left in there it's all over the [ __ ] sides of this jar is where it's at you guys want to see a big squirt huh all right let's get it gotta get off this cyber dream stuff though um all right let's get it big old fatty this one feels like a 27-30-ish somewhere in there all right let's go i don't want to listen to trap sorry i gotta get i gotta get the right music on first this is bothering me put on some good old tj hotto all right let's go i'm gonna fold this one down the center i just pinch it crease it down the center diagonal the other diagonals and that gives you kind of like a good flow right there already and then you just pinch the sides together and it's like let me check my battery here 85 percent go dude i'm all smoking one squeeze okay shout out to my man mysticalgo my official artist on sbnb records back down oh yep bomb extraction on that one let's go cross mountain ranges split cells of tomorrow it flowed so well there's like not even that much on the paper let us go yes uh let's keep this party [ __ ] going good over here peace i think i put some information in the description maybe i didn't add that i guess but 25 micron double bag from rosin inc for the uh for the bags my bad y'all i tried to put some information in there and i left out that one yo if you guys can't catch the live streams sign up for my patreon i upload them there so come to daddy um is i'm the master of my own fate i determine my own yield i grew the flowers this is the source of the single i am my own god excuse you uh is that's why i keep the ends of these parchment pieces wrap them over the parchment paper i wish i could slow this down listen listen did you [ __ ] catch it though my man [ __ ] threw it in putting him on game yo understand he let y'all know i'm putting y'all on game for free i'm gonna i'm gonna take it back one time is it too loud uh um let's go ladies and gentlemen it's time to flow i'm gonna bring you guys back some i feel like i'm not bad hold on you guys don't really need that flashlight i don't think anyways let me take it off and passed wrench squad hold it down here's a pro tip on really fat pucks make sure you leave a little extra space behind the puck so that you don't get a blowout but i can mute it that's fine didn't need that light but i'm not liking how that's lining up on the [ __ ] plates i'm gonna move it over just a tad real quick like uh is i go go go go go real big extraction what is it [ __ ] this one's really done i'm calling it now it's gonna be a dumper is nobody [ __ ] with you you know what as a kid i actually did like origami and [ __ ] you know what was better than origami paper [ __ ] planes god damn it paper planes with a [ __ ] i could fold all types of paper planes you guys when i was a kid not now you know why i can't do it now because i lost the book i didn't look that [ __ ] up read that [ __ ] in the book you know what i mean books are cool as [ __ ] you can learn how to make paper airplanes and [ __ ] who would have thought mm-hmm starting to get good at this [ __ ] so um okay well brown is foreign i until you quit this next one's gonna squirt like a [ __ ] so um okay i have that camera ready i'm gonna record this one on my phone i'm not sure how i'ma do it watch me money money all the time hey money please no worries it's only 200 degrees touch it with your [ __ ] hands that sense sorry i'm trying to align this a little bit differently here safety reasons there it is my press has a ram that can adjust positions so um it's a little bit different than most the ram isn't stationary which means that it can come out of alignment sometimes if i move it or whatever but it's all we're helping to make good taking care of your summer projects is a breeze bam summer savings on all your favorite brands make things even easier so freshen up the deck and fire up the grill summer's here and it's as close as your home yard get more done let's get it i've used this prosper [ __ ] ever you're biking like five years now i just let go of the [ __ ] bar my bad you guys the camera is on a very unsteady amount kinda i don't have the tripod leg spread out very well all right is to the place whoa the puck slit in the plates when i was adjusting it apparently almost popped out of the front no blow out though but i gotta pull it out real quick and readjust it i'm so glad that didn't blow out but somehow that slipped out that's a trip i'm so happy that i didn't blow out that's crazy what the [ __ ] i've never had that happened that's a trip that's a trip son experience saved for real he wouldn't would he he [ __ ] would let's go back on the plates you go you son of a [ __ ] that was a trippy trip trippy trip trip this thing is about i was like why is it not going like it should be leaking way more and then all of a sudden the handle slipped and i was like what the [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] what happened put that back on the plate for a second up a let that so hmm who's your daddy who's your daddy what a safe uh is before oh yeah good extraction i'll take it oh yeah let's power through it two more to go parchment gets added to the jar everything i want everything together mixed together equal even steven the stuff that sticks to the parchment might be different terpenes might be different different [ __ ] you know you don't want to leave it out shop from the comfort of your home at sprint.com that's not a lot of work bro i know i'm saying it's already time to upgrade the jar again i just got this damn jar i'm upset it's not fun i thought for sure it was going to be good enough we knew get a bigger drawer uh bertha it's time to go squirtle what the [ __ ] it did it again something's going on here is it sliding something's happening here there's no blowout but it's sliding off pressure's not being applied evenly to the plates somehow or they're too tight or i pre-packed them at an angle never had this happen okay i know what i'm about to do fix this i'm going to have to increase the pressure even slower every problem there is a solution hmm leaned on him to apply pressure for the pre-press by doing it evenly i had to have been time to upgrade and put my bigger plates on i guess for these bigger presses right inside there i hope you guys are watching this if you guys aren't [ __ ] paying attention i don't know what you're doing right now when i mess up that's when you guys need to pay attention because i don't mess up very often not to sound cocky whatsoever but i don't so if i make a mistake that's resulting in some type of mess up it would benefit everybody around me to pay attention and realize what i'm doing wrong so i got my light that's fine before i make sure i got the jar underneath there i didn't think it was going to squirt like that still this parchment is heavy from the [ __ ] first part of the press but it's still flowing good that's all that matters and no blowout fan dumb strong on the top setting don't you get a damn hum my curl is my rocker maybe i choose you and i don't even have i don't even have um i have a couple theories for what it is lots of adjusts right now it's increasing pressure too fast and also i have the press at a a pretty good angle right now leaning towards the front and i think that the hash is melting and making the puck inside uneven and then it blows out the front like that so i think i'm just going to go ahead oops just hit the table i'm going to go ahead and flatten out the press a little bit more risky with this puck anymore how would i do on the save [ __ ] crazy giving her incredible so okay my battery at 34 okay um check the alignment of the plates one more me come on gloves don't stupid i know it's not that cold in here but then mm-hmm little 74 degrees in here oh missiles contemplating life changes foreign foreign let me grab some parchment hold on i got an idea not so much as an idea that i just want to do something for this press just insurance actually all okay searching for savings on descriptions is so complex it's like getting a documentary unfortunately you just savings period not all patients eligible savings so um me yes i haven't even hit one ton of pressure you guys think i'm kidding look so just hit two and a half oh figured it out right pressure was increasing too fast and the angle probably didn't know so so well aren't you guys glad i got the internet connections really good attraction well wow please so um batteries are charged let's get a battery swap in before we do anything else we'll go from there sound good oh think so okay all right so good job bertha good job baby we're gonna take a dab and then after this dab i'm going to um go ahead and collect what's on the parchment and get it added to the jar while it's still warm man that's heavy that's heavy i mean yield wise i'm thinking it's got to be it's got to be upwards of 80 it has to be you know there's it is no [ __ ] way it's not it's a little harsh didn't it that's okay i'll turn it down i knew there was a little [ __ ] nap thingy in here a little [ __ ] flew right on me else we know there's never a good time to run out of fresh luckily our delivery and free pickup excuse me so whether it's a few extra guns from the back all right i mean you can't help it i got lights on in here when i come in through the garage little [ __ ] just came in with me i guess oh boy oh what are we taking a dab off i mean this is the 160 and 25. this

bit of runs on here i'm gonna grab some more though on the outside of one of these parchments but i smeared i know there's like a bunch on the outside i could take so i don't have to dip into the jar or anything i'm i'm weird right now you're like call that fresh press man i wish i'll give you a melt so like wood that's runs wow wow that flavor is intense now that i haven't dabbed it in a while in

what's up and welcome back to the strange show the adults-only marijuana channel where i teach you new fun facts about weed every week don't forget to subscribe and you can put some nuggets of knowledge into your stream brain today we're gonna be trying some of this wedding cake live sugar from natty realms extracts it's testing it seventy one point two seven percent THC let's see what we paid for this it's thirty dollars and forty nine cents for two grams of live sugar this was on sale for a forty percent off so I think I got a really good deal and I'm pretty stoked to try this wedding cake so let's open one of these up and see what she's looking like we've got the little natty rims logo oh you have a great endocannabinoid system sick come on mat here it's stronger than a child oh wow check it out nice and chunky alright let's scoop one of these guys out and see what it's talking about it smells good like oh it smells like a cush so hard sort of has that Girl Scout cookie smell but it's fresh out of the refrigerator so it's doesn't smell very strong yet but I assume when we dab this guy it's gonna be hella flavorful okay I have this step perfectly balanced on this stick and you see it sort of got ahead of myself oh don't fall don't fall okay and I got the right carb cap for these pearls this time this little spinning guy right here but it sucks it doesn't really spin the pearls very well it doesn't work for a carb cap very well either so we're just going to stick to this guy cuz it works really good but it doesn't spin the pearls very well so oh whoa wedding cake strange Oh [Music] oh yeah [Music] very nice very nice mMmmm no it's good got me I has a very indica taste very reminiscent of a cush or maybe a Kim dog so wedding cake is Girl Scout cookie crossed with cherry pie and I'm pretty sure that Girl Scout cookie is a Kim dog cross and I can really taste that Kim og kind of flavor in here real strong and it tastes real good I love in because I love pushes above Kim I love Girl Scout cookie I love wedding cake this is right up my alley it's a real strong kiss flavor with like citrusy hints some kind of hands it's got like a sweet also maybe that's the cookie coming through that sweet sweetness with the citrus so it's like the main flavor is boom funk funky og Kim and then it's like ooh sweet ooh a little citrus - yeah this is good I'm glad I got two grams of the same strain once I don't do a whole lot but I was like the wedding cake for the 40% off so grams was alive for 30 bucks um I'm about that all day all day and I wasn't sure about some budget hair so I good but then I looked at it and I was like I'm fine although and it did me right I'm glad I got this okay stranger who'd sometimes in slow Tim Tams go forever [Music] still so little pump left Oh still still straight phone what is that taste I would call it that super Citra Funkadelic oof yeah that tastes good quality hash indeed all right so we're gonna do the usual piece out for 20 minutes and then we'll come back and assess the high from this tasty tasty live sugar I will see you in 20 minutes and boom to the powers of multi-million dollar Hollywood special-effects 20 minutes has elapsed and I return so this high is very nice it's a really strong indica heavy hi and I'm just real chill right now super duper chill and if you like in because you will like this a lot this would probably be real good for nighttime too like for going to bed ebed my eyes feel super heavy I'm sure I look super stoned very pleased with this for 30 bucks for 32 bucks for two grams very pleased my live sugar that's what I wanted to look like and put some wedding cake that's what I want it to taste like so I'll give the wedding cake from natty rooms a nine out of 10 I want to give it a 10 out of 10 because I feel like that should be reserved for something spectacular which this was really good but I wouldn't say spectacular so let's give it a 9 out of 10 highly recommend but I am partial because I love live resin and I love indicus and I love wedding cake so you know who knows but I bet you would like this if you like it because if you like getting stoned do you like live resin give it a try thanks for watching buddy I'll see you in the next video", "qFQ0ICv5yPA": "hey everybody how's it going today well you're in for a treat here i'm pressing

and we're pressing this at 200 degrees on my crd 20 ton drip tech rosin press and if we're lucky we're going to get a chance to show you how it tilts and how it how it drips it right off the plates so here we go hope everybody is having a great thanksgiving hope you're staying safe staying medicated being good to each other out there it was a very low-key day just myself my wife and our and our kitty zina warrior today and watched a little football watched a little movies and now it's time to make a little video that's what we're doing today i hope everybody got some really good flowers some good concentrates whatever it is that you'd like to do with cannabis as far as medicating i hope that you found something that that works for you uh i definitely have this stuff is an indica heavy hybrid very endicoline and it is incredibly incredibly body heavy uh it will pouch-lock you so let's see here just let that heat start to work a little bit before i go up to full pressure let me know what you guys are hitting on in the comments please uh subscribe and and hit the thumbs up if you like this video and the videos that i put out uh bring this pressure up a little bit now see if we can get him to start sweating a little bit gotta keep adjusting the lighting as it as those plates come together it gets harder and harder to give you a good view of things so please bear with me as i readjust things a little bit here to ensure that you're still seeing what's going on now let's start with sweat already you see that the very front edge at the top of the left hand bag and right down at the bottom in the front edge of the right i'm bringing the pressure up gently don't want to risk a blowout at that medicine i'm going to bring it in a little closer for you see that look at that all right let's bring her up to pressure look at that material move look at it move as i add pressure to it look at that beautiful beautiful medicine continuing to bring it up that material still moving once i get where i feel is full pressure on this i will tilt this thing forward and we will see if any of it wants to drip i think we're good right there so bear with me here as i back out of this i'm gonna move the camera a little bit here so you can see what is going on lighting the face down here okay so here we go tilt it and see if it gives us anything there we go all right let's see if i'll get that a little bit better for you look at that medicine [Music] look at that that's what i'm talking about [Music] youth you know a lot of people say they don't like flower raws and they prefer hash rosin or whatever you know what that's fine but quite honestly i get really good clarity really good purity from pressing high quality high thc flower and i swear by it and it isn't just because i know that hash rosin is supposedly better but it's it's also a lot easier to produce i mean once you've made it into bubble hash pressing that into rosin is not all together that difficult and you get amazing yields because you're already pressing the concentrate however you press flower that takes some skill and take some serious skill to get right to get get it so you're not having contamination to get the kind of clarity and quality that that i am getting off this this is a real serious serious thing that i do uh and i specialize in pressing flower rosin i don't have access to enough material to do hash pa it is what it is you know but i make real real decent flower rods this is garbage in garbage out the better the material i get the better the rosins bigger the yields every time okay so let's tilt this back up now readjust our our shot back out we're gonna put this back over here get our lighting right back where it needs to be let's bear with me a moment now you seeing this are you watch this [Music] oh baby look at all that beautiful medicine tell me that isn't just amazing the smell is incredible so pull it off of here again bear with me as i readjust lighting and move things around here me uh get back down to what you need to see now okay so there we go oh yeah pucks came out perfectly no blowouts everything went where it was supposed to go that's what i'm talking about so we have that and in that so i am going to just kind of give you two times look yeah that's a good good shot right there let's see what's going on and there we go got a nice glass jar here i'm gonna tear it on the scale so i know [Music] 26.6 okay so this is my favorite tool this is a skillet skillet tools um you can get them in kits you can get them singly i prefer these i think that they uh they hold up well uh they work well for me and just look at that beautiful stable gorgeous rosin that just gathers up real nice real easy indication of quality right there oh my look at that wedding cake oh yeah get you some of that look at that now if you are a pittsburgh area medical marijuana patient with a card and you bring me dispensary flower the higher the thc the better uh i will for free do this press it into google for you turning green into golden think of a lot worse ways to spend my time to tell you the truth this is therapeutic for me i love extracting it especially like medicated this is a lot of medicine right here picks right up hope i get it all in the jar i can tell you after pressing it yesterday waxes up beautifully overnight just at room temp room temperature cure in the jar waxes up amazingly excellent flavor immediate body effects from this strain for me okay your mileage may vary but quite honestly i am very very pleased with the results i'm getting from wedding cake and as long as it's around i will continue to get it just keeps producing okay look at that look at those highlights as you pull it across it's all gold copper and we got those and dripped off those two little jewels will just sit right there as we figure out what our yield was from this ounce all right quick calculation here okay here's here's the yield 32.81 32. minus the tare value of the container which is 26.6 6. and that gives us a yield of 6.2 grams and let's see i'll have to get back with you on the yield percentage because i shoot this video with my phone and unfortunately my calculator is on there too so we got 6.2 gram yield from 28 grams of wedding cake processed to 200 degrees through a 120 mesh micron screen thank you very much for joining me i want to thank crd for making excellent rosin presses at some of the best prices in the industry everybody's have a great thanksgiving stay safe stay medicated be good to each other look at those meds", "Kg8MX7yE_54": "easier welcome back everybody this step we're gonna be doing a little bit of a hash review I haven't done any of those and like a while so I just wanted to do a quick smoke out and talk about some of the hash that that I have seen that is not mine and you know we'll smoke it and talk about it I obviously got this stuff from bubble modes this is from a whole plant fresh frozen run I gave him this cut of the cookies and cream that I you know pop the seeds from a while back and I gave him a cut and he decided to wash it and it came out amazing I cannot talk about enough how much this stuff is fire super surprised this is a fee no I hadn't washed before so I mean I thought it was just I thought it was just a strain that would look good in the bag I didn't think it was this washable I mean I have a different fee know that I was washing and sifting I don't know which one is better I think the one I have still is better for sift but I might have to give that one another try obviously it was I mean everything whole plant fresh frozen means that it was chopped down and went straight in the freezer even the top coalos we're not just talking about trim and then larf this is like top rock-hard colas going in there too I did a similar run with the pineapple Express where I I mean I washed everything about it and it's drying right now I'll probably smoke some on the show with the later date because is like the first time that I did it and it came out absolutely phenomenal I'm gonna check it that out it's amazing or what oh my god look at that and again I mean the camera it's it looks phenomenal on camera but the camera still isn't doing it justice like it is it's like white white this this light kind of makes it look a little yellowish I mean when you pour this stuff out it is stark white super impressive pretty stable he was worried that it was still a little wet so we'll give that a shot and see if it is if it is it's not a big deal I was kind of impatient anyway I said he'd been drying it for like Oh ten days or so and he still wasn't sure if it was dry which was crazy I know his room is spot on so I mean it's in the mid 30s as far as humidity which should be drying hash out in definitely seven days but this strain just might be that greasy I have a couple of people that were asking me if it's worth it to wash whole plant I mean it's kinda not like BHO where you're gonna get a higher yield because it's Bud like it's pretty much gonna be about the same yield you would have got off a tram which is discouraging but I feel like the hash is better mean you're gonna get the same amount of total weight and resin but I think there's gonna be more heads in the bags that more heads in the bags that are good so there's gonna be more 90 more 70 less 25 yeah and even I mean my experience with whole plant I mean this isn't a hundred percent of the time but it seems like even the 190 and the 160 seem to be extremely better than then they would have been just off of trim mainly because you know the 160 and 190 bag are on and you let you guys take a peek at that I know you guys like the hash for him hmm good clear one before yeah really nice glistening juice the 160 and the 190 are like you know they're for bigger particulates realistically but when you watch whole plant it seems like there's more mature heads on there so there might be some big bulbous turkey heads that end up landing in there and I've seen some 190 melt like five six star same thing with 160 which is is rare if you're washing hash and trim I think I think whenever I do trim runs it seems like that 190 is a little green and the 160 is maybe a little bit lighter but same kind of texture when it comes to the the hash kind of gritty and you know fiber risk I mean you could already see this stuff I mean it is like see-through so yeah when people ask me hey am I gonna get a better yield with with nugs I generally just tell them no because you're not really you might get more six-star but not very much more it'll definitely beter beer and now that rosin is in the game it really is more no prevalent because if you take all that lower grade hash that you normally wouldn't smoke and you just rosin it up and it turns into six star or better I guess some people claim some people like to call it seven star or I've even heard somebody call their resin ten star which is kind of silly no again didn't really have too much terribly to talk about today I was going to put up another video instead but I hadn't done any of these cache reviews in a while and I got gifted this stuff I got some other stuff too I gotta ask him what the names are for it I he called it something but didn't write it on the thing so god the smell is just so cookies-and-cream if you guys have ever had the strain it's really like super cleaner a little bit of cookies in there but just heavy with with like a cleanness and if you've ever had any of exotic genetics crosses that Starfighter that starfighters creaminess definitely carries on you gotta go nailed it all right pack them a little bit extra on there probably would have taken this a two hits normally but I don't want to get it's the first thing in the morning I want to get a nice juicy one for yours so again thank you bubble modes really appreciate these type of gift this guy makes awesome hash I can't really say that enough one of the most humble guys I've ever met and he really started off just not knowing much at all about you know extracts and just cannabis in general and he's gone from like zero to a hundred in and just you know over a year and I'm just super super impressed with the product that he is churning out yeah look out for this guy dude this guy is killing the hash man for sure I always loved to see new products coming out of his corner they're definitely worth the time to check out the quick smoke on I think that's pretty much all I wanted to talk about if you guys have any questions or comments feel free to leave them down below I do not mind answering them I'll try to keep it positive though there's been a couple trolls hanging around you know basically just saying my hash is garbage which is kind of silly to me but everybody's entitled to their own opinion but to those people I really don't know why you stick around and watch my videos I I know I have to be long-winded and just unpleasant to watch if you're not enjoying the content so I would just maybe not watch the video if you don't like it just the suggestion though by all means come and spend 20 minutes to hate let's just take another look at this stuff I mean I wish I could shine a light through it for you guys it's super duper clear exciting alright cookies-and-cream whole plant fresh frozen Cheers oh man super Turkey Wow such a Perla just to even be sampling that but do you believe that this is the 90 you obviously the makers stash a lot of people don't get to try this bag and definitely that's where all the good stuff lives such a creamy flavor if you haven't had a chance to just try some of exotics genetics you know cookies and cream Kimbo Kush and I know he has a new dessert menu coming out for his seed line but the cookies & creme Kimbo coach are just so flavorful I know that he's been winning cups with that also look at the screen here is that not an insane melt I mean ah just straight juice but I definitely would call that six-star and I wouldn't enjoy getting more of that I would smoke that every day it's absolutely a pleasure mmm Lim cleanliness to start the morning I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll catch you next time", "aCFFfgKSfec": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you better think about what you do [Music] foreign yeah yep [Music] [Music] you're yeah [Music] [Music] is [Music] think about what you're doing think about what you're doing", "8qd9OXxbvmQ": "first off we've got fig farms animal face so that's a sativa dominant cross between face off oh gee and animal mints opening up it's got some nice packaging a lot of information on the box not so much on the jar itself take a look at this you can kind of see it through the glass there one thing I really like about this one is the term job there's not a lot of unwanted leaves everything there is something in fact you can see me here having a little trouble with the childproofing I don't know why they feel the need to make that so effective I mean the lighters themselves are already supposed to be childproof right should be fine it's got this little airtight seal here we're gonna go ahead and peel that off not stuck on very firmly but it is stuck to the rim of the jar there you can see take a look at what's in here looking pretty good not bad at all you can see up here is a close-up of one of the buds again I really want to stress the trim job on this very nice pretty much everything there is something that you're you're looking for the total contents of the jar out on a trace you can get a better idea of what you'd be looking at if you were to get this very light not very dense at all a lot of buds for the weight this is only 1/8 so this is 3 and 1/2 grams and you're looking at you know a lot of volume there it's a little bit ground-up again you can see that even ground up there's there's a few pieces of you know more or less garbage leaf material that you don't really want there but overall the trim job is really really good high quality I kind of wish you'll see I was able to stabilize the camera for this shot not so for the future shots but yeah very very nice super inoffensive flavor taste is all-around nice has a little bit of an aftertaste I will say that up next is a triple sevens wedding cake so that's an indica forward cross between cherry pie and Girl Scout cookies I it's got an herbaceous smell slightly sweet slightly astringent very mild all around this strain actually won the best indica of 2019 from the High Times joke cup so it's you know you can expect it to be good taking a look at this the trim job not quite as good actually as the as the animal face there are a few Trash leaves here and there but I could have been plucked off but all around still looking nice still looking nice so we're just gonna set that down there and take a couple more looks at these buds cuz they do look quite juicy quite crispy indeed all right now this shot I actually had to hold the phone and arch my neck over very tough but I'm really proud of this one I think it turned out really nice another one with a really inoffensive flavor this one's actually more palatable in my opinion and it lacks the aftertaste the other one as well as just having a really comfortable and clean hive all around a great product in my opinion alright and lastly we've got Kelly stripe strawberry banana this is live rosin it's just a little half gram of batter that we threw in there just to have some concentrate unfortunately the dab rig that we were using had previously been used to smoke flour so I can't get a great taste profile on this for you but what I can tell you is that the smell is very inoffensive I also didn't have any of it this is reka taking a DAB here trying to take a little taster dab but as previously mentioned the the piece was smoked out of so it's hard to get any kind of a taste profile on that really but all-around inoffensive nice another one with a very clean high and solid deal all these I would highly recommend very good products my personal favorite of the ones tried definitely has to go to the wedding cake done it several times you know several times now and have not been disappointed a single time all around a good value anyway that's all I've got to say

welcome to the town house here in Venice give thanks to bud gasm over here for bringing us all together my name is Nick Atia of essential extracts I'm joined by Phil Salazar of soil grown solvent list we got some other family over here give thanks to everyone who's shown up and come out shown support and is here to talk to about the history of rosin we wanted to provide a little education and throw it back to some of the people that have been involved since day one that have got us to where we're at today so Phillip did you want to say a little something about yourself before we get started I'm just here to talk about the history of rosin I'm super excited about it I like where it's gone where it started and where we're pushing towards so I'm just stoked to talk about it I don't well I'm gonna break into it I love giving credit where credit's due and I'm extremely blessed to have been here from basically day one from when this term was coined basically so a lot of this started before Instagram and before Facebook we had a lot of underground forums and the forums were where a lot of us growers and hash makers gained a lot of our knowledge so there was this gentleman named confession compassion Co mph a s o n I believe yes h o n but I also you know his his name is out there freely his name is chadwick Bastardo and i really like to give credit to this gentleman because back in the day there were a few forums that that I was on along with this gentleman compassion and he was really the one who started using this term the term rosin has actually been around for centuries it's been around for a long time in the adhesive and in that world the adhesive world just for a gummy substance you know sermons to like violins yeah rosin that term has been around for a long time it really was brought into the cannabis industry when confession started utilizing a stainless steel bowl with the stainless steel spoon heating up that bowl heating up that spoon and literally mechanically pressing his bubble hash into that bowl and stirring it around and he started noticing this ring of oil on the outside of that bubble hash and he was like huh that's interesting there's this separation and so he started pulling that ring of oil with his dab or tool off of there and back then it was knife hits and he started taking that oil off and taking knife hits and noticing that there was a lot less residue and back then the term full melt clear dome FM CD was a very popular term for when we got bubble hash or water hash so good and so clean that it would bubble up and make these clear domes and basically burn to very little if not no residue it wasn't until Chadwick compassion actually started playing with this technology of utilizing hot stainless steel instruments and mechanically separating the oils from the waxes that he took this knife hit saw these clear domes and saw zero residue and I really want to say that that's where rosin started but at that time there was no way to make that technology commercialized or scalable you know a lot of people in this industry talked about how is it scalable how do you scale this technology and that's where a lot of things are going and so you know back then it was the hash makers treat rosin started spreading that term you know this is back I want to say 2005 maybe 2007 2007 I'm really bad with the actual date but this is pre dabbing you know so back then it was the hash maker that got to keep that ring of oil for themselves you know rosin really wasn't able to get out to the masses until people like this gentleman came along and I want to talk and I want him to talk to you guys about what really pushed rosin to be scalable initially what was the term that you came up with and what were you doing well I think I called it like solving this hash sha sha something like that but the way it started I was just really really into making hash and you know all my melts and stuff and smoking it and then like it got to a point where I ran solo on what I had I didn't have any more of my harvest and I got solo on my melts I was like literally trying to smoke like four star three-and-a-half star like low-quality melt hash so and I have to give thanks to you because I remember seeing a tip on your page back then where I would take Milo my like my low-grade melts and put them between parchment I'd use a hair straightener just to thin it out and it actually helped I was able to get a better dab off low quality hash and you know I got tired of that and so I'm trying to remember like exactly but fast-forwarding you know past like flattening my hash out and like just dabbing it like that getting to the point where I'm running out of my dabs so something went off in my head I remember just thinking like back okay okay going back again okay I remember I messed up doing that I pressed it too hard not in the hair straightener and I see it would be real shiny on the outside and dry in the middle and I wouldn't think anything of it I'd fold it up do it again phone I used to do that like I'd fold it up like three times so it'd be nice and like homogenized a nice good melt off of a low-quality hash you know what I mean the best you'd get off of it so light bulb goes off in my head I'm thinking back I remember that shininess I remember the dry so I didn't have a hair straightener laying there this is the longest story possible of it but didn't have a hair straightener laying there so I actually took a chunk of hash between a piece of parchment shoved it up against the email with my finger and I'd try not to burn myself or burn the paper on the side of the coil and sure enough I pulled it off and there was oil like I was hoping that would happen very little not enough to dab so I kept doing it doing it doing it took me like five ten minutes to get one dab hit it and sure enough my father-in-law family was there nothing it melted to nothing and it we were just amazed so from there it would that's where it started that's where the Hat I would say that's where the rosin for me started you know it started by a mistake that came back to me later on as an idea and I took it from there you know and so I was I was pressing hash so it all started with hash for me no screen screen wasn't any part of it at all so I was making low quality rosin still could still small contaminants in it for the most part it melted to nothing and so I ran out of all my hash and we got to a point you know we're just smoking bud so Bing light bulb and I took a bud and I did the same oh and actually when I was pressing the hash my wife had come out and she brought me a hair straightener cuz I had been using her hair curler and so she swapped that out for me so boom I get back to the out of the hash now I'm at the weed I pressed a but I think it's like 400 degrees super freakin hot so I pressed it on the parchment and crazy amount of oil came out of it like three of us got a dab off of like a little half gram bud so we were just amazed and they just went non-stop from there like nights of just pressing out eighths taking like five six hours just to press out an eighth on a hair straightener and that's where it took off and really I think that's where are all of our light bulbs turned on because we're like that's where it's scalable this guy is pressing flowers you know because before we you know us hash makers we didn't want to press the best-quality hash you know we've we got amazing quality hash and we wanted to keep it as that you know we might have started playing with a hair straightener to press it so that we could dab it but we weren't anywhere in the mindset of actually removing that waxy cuticle until I feel like flour rosin came about in that term I really want to give credit to Phil over here because I think that's what changed game for a lot of people especially on the mast level because kids all over the world had flour it was a lot harder for them to come by amazing water hash but they had flour and they had a hair straightener and that's what change game at that time is when I really believe we're pushing towards you know safe extraction you know everybody wanted to make oil we're all dabbers you know and when at a time when when solvent list was scarce and when you'd get hash and it wouldn't melt it's just a disappointment it was hard to come by six star five star even good hash to even know what it was so I lost my thought that hash split right before [Music] but yeah going back to it you know we came from somewhere and I'm just gonna give you guys a little recap right now we came from somewhere where we were watching forums of this guy named compassion taking bubble hash and pushing it on some stainless steel bowl to then playing with hair straighteners to then pressing flour itself into flour rosin and now look look where we've come you know there's been so many different advances in technology since then this man helped put out one of the very first rosin presses on the market there's been so many other rosin presses since and the technology just keeps changing and evolving and you know it's it's I think it's thanks to the education that we started the open forum education style that can fashion was pushing it on originally that we've continued that trend of really pushing education to our peers to our community and it just continues to evolve into something that I had never even imagined I grew up making bubble hash in my uncle's barn in a hot barn and now we're actually separating THC their THC a you know on a scientific level really we're seeing 99.9% THC a without the use of any chemical solvent so it's really really really come a long way pickup everyone that's involved in that movement we can talk about you know where it's going now so are you guys familiar with some of the new consistencies that we're seeing out there how many show hands out there in the crowd how many of you guys have tried rosin just rosin alright so when we first started making rosin was really when the consistency of earwax was popular in the BHO world so I'm gonna bring it back to like 2008/2009 and Pho had really just hit the market pho was called earwax back then so as us hash makers started to make water hash on a more controlled level a higher level we wanted to mimic what was happening in the BHO world so this is pre rosin but we started making hash on a higher level where the hash was coming out gold rather than brown and it was coming out smelling really like the flour that it was come from because we were controlling the variables of the water the temperature of the water our environment that we were making the hash in and that starting material we started really really paying attention to the starting material rather than using stuff at uncle's farm that had been sitting on the side of the road that he didn't want on his property because that was more weight on his property that's what we were making bubble hash out of initially up in Mendocino Humboldt County we started making bubble hash out of close trim and not just the close term mixed with all the fan leaf and everything else they were throwing away then we started making water hash out of fresh frozen material you know I think 2008-2009 was when I first did my first wash with fresh frozen material and at this point we're making water hash with whole plant fresh frozen material later on we're gonna talk about some of the amazing magicians in the crowd over here that can make fire with dry trim it's been sitting around but right now you know the pinnacle of water hash is using whole plant fresh frozen I'm jumping around a little bit here but throw it back to that 2008-2009 generation when earwax was popular we start learning a little bit more and then chatter becomes extremely popular 2009 Colorado California 2010 and Shatter is the consistency so we started wanting to recreate that consistency of shatter so we started heating up our hair straighteners a little bit hotter you know pressing in between parchment paper just our water hash at a higher temperature to create more stability more of a clear see-through shatter consistency and I think that's another one of the variables that pushed us as hash makers to find out what rosin was we wanted more stability we're trying to create these consist we were seeing in the BHO world but we weren't seeing as much stability if you just press hash at you know 200 250 degrees you're gonna see it turn into shatter but eventually you're gonna see it start to degrade turn darker butter up some of those issues and it wasn't until rosin came along and rosin the actual art of rosin is removing the rest of that waxy cuticle if you look at cannabis cannabis you know is a plant that has a lot of these shiny trichomes on the outside the crystals if you will all plants have different structures of these crystals and as hash makers and specifically rosin makers we're learning about this structure even more with every strain that we run some strains have that longer stalk with a very small head with a thick waxy cuticle and they may not run as well in water hash they may not press as well in rosin you start seeing some strains that have a thick stalk in a really bulbous head with a thin waxy cuticle and you're seeing them run better in water hash you're seeing the waxy cuticle effect the rosin less and you're seeing higher yields higher potencies and so you know moving forward we started seeing these different consistencies like shatter like the ear wax and then as we move we started seeing this sauce consistency in the butane world where we were seeing a layer of terpenes on the outside and it's pushed us rosin makers to continue this movement and to continue trying to create a higher echelon for our industry by pushing education and I think we've taught each other at this point that we can now separate THC a via different temperatures and different pressures to pull those terpenes and pull those the THC a separate that and now as we see these saucy and jammy consistencies in the BHO world we've been playing with pressure just like butane hash oil is utilizing these columns basically to pull pressure and then keep the butane and the trichomes under pressure creating separation we're now seeing the same thing in the solvent list world some are calling it rosin jam some are calling it solvent list sauce but we're seeing these consistencies now via ultimately means and rosin so rosin history just continues as we see different consistencies as we see I feel like as we see now hydrocarbon guys starting to separate delta-9 and CBG and THC v that's all with pressure and columns and temperature and so I think as we continue that might be some of what we see in the future as far as what rosin can really do you don't need a column you don't need heavy chemicals you don't need to possibly bro up blow up your neighbor's house we're seeing all of these different consistencies via solving this means thanks to rosin through the use of heat pressure and force right on I think that really kind of concludes it do we have any questions from the audience or anything else anybody think that rosin is going in another direction anybody disagree what what we talked about as far as the history of rosin it's a trip how far we've come really this started what 10 12 years ago and now it's on the commercial market heavy I just actually came from cookies in Maywood and there was a ton of different rosin brands on the shelf and it was amazing to see it started 10 years ago but I'd say realistically it took off about five years ago when when the masses started to learn and do it themselves at home and the more Minds that are able to focus and work on it and share the knowledge that they find that's why I think that's why we've quickly evolved this technique you know compared to has been around forever and it's taken so long to get to where it is but you know with the butane extraction and with everybody hands-on trying to do you know learn two new techniques and do the next best thing with solvent lists or with rosin I think that's where we're breaking through and and I think you're right we're gonna find you know all these different components we're going to be able to separate you know we're already at the point where we're separating THC and fats and terpenes so I think we're there it's pretty crazy to see some of the hydrocarbon companies switching over to solving this you know that's that's where I feel like that's when we made it you know like this education really did something we got the guys that have been known for making butane making solvent list now that's one of the cool things you know as of January 1st 2019 a lot of the new regulations came into California and it was very difficult to just set up a closed-loop system get the fire department out there go through all those regulations people are able to get to the end goal of a concentrate and a nice healthy alternative right one regulations hit and some of the first companies to come to shelf were rosin companies or solving those companies because it was a little bit easier to get manufacturing going licensing for type six via type seven was a little bit easier to push through she didn't have to deal with the fire burn nearly as much still do but a lot of factors have really really changed game I feel like when we started putting solvent list products or water hash products on the shelves in Colorado back in 2009 we were maybe 1 to 3% of the concentrate market was water hash and at this point I think we're definitely pushing 20% of the concentrates especially in places like California and Colorado so big up ourselves appreciate all the support and keep pushing education for real that's what puts the products on the shelves that are healthy that's what puts the quality on the shelves and that's what helps the consumer understand what's good well I mean the perfect example is the diamonds you know we kind of touched on it but I'll back it up a little bit just in case anybody didn't catch that one but in the hydrocarbon world right when we learned about roz in a year or two into learning really about commercializing and scaling up the creation of rosin we started seeing the butane guys make diamonds and we're like oh we got to learn we got to step up our game over here we're on shadow right now you know we're starting to make this butter and these lighter consistencies but diamonds oh how do we make this in the lab how do we compete and really you know it was all in playing with different temperatures different pressures different separations I feel like the first diamonds were not actually grown we're now seeing on the solvent side of things growing diamonds with pressure but the first diamonds to come to the industry were actually mechanically separated amorphous solids morphus solid crystalline yeah and you know I was gonna bring it up a little earlier I might have touched on the gentleman but I have too big up a man named Jeff or the cannabis Reverend this revenue because of church Jeff church cannabis Reverend was one of the first gentlemen to bring in the actual micron screen to separate the oils from the waxes or what we later found out to be a lot of that THC a you know so that bag not only contained a lot of the waxes but it also contained a lot of the THC a so eventually we learned that pressing at higher temperatures would completely remove the rest of the the terpenes and actually are a lot of the rest of the cannabinoids and at those higher temperatures we were just retaining THC a right and eventually we learned that that white powdery substance was the THC a that we are seeing some of these hydrocarbon companies put out we started testing some of those that white powdery substance and hitting anywhere from 94 to 99% THC a in our regulated licensed labs in Colorado and then we were like whoa how do we turn this white powder into what looks like the diamonds more heat and pressure so we brought the temperature right back up to around 250 degrees people do it at different temperatures but basically to melt that white powder back down into a solid form and then you can mold that that form into whatever shape you want I think when we first started doing it we were just making very very thick slabs so we started with the white powder we heated it up into these thicker slabs and we were smashing it in the lab and in our parchment paper and it was basically just making all different shapes and sizes of crystal and we started getting that tested and even with that slight temperature up crease upwards at 250 degrees we were not seeing any THC a turn into THC which was interesting and our labs were telling us that it was pure 99.9 percent THC in fact some of the labs that we were using not to put anybody on blast some of the labs that we were using for giving us test results back at one one hundred and eight point four percent THC a so we had to step back and say okay we can't put this on the shelf that doesn't make any sense you can't have over a hundred percent what's happening here and we contacted the lab they're like well we've never seen anything that high you know what's going on and we started looking at the standards and you know this is gonna be an ongoing issue in newly regulated environments but one of the standards came from res Tech and there's another standard that's put out with another company there's a few more companies that are putting out cannabis standards now but res Tech Stander's range from like ninety seven to ninety eight point nine percent their THC a standard and when we turned in our THC a sample is higher than that so we bumped the scale and I feel like they have to create some new standards at this point but we started leveling it out the lab started learning and we were mechanically separating THC a so to get back to the original question mimicking these hydrocarbon guys you know it started with the earwax we created solvent less wax now the rosin has really really given us the advantage to recreate different consistencies we're seeing in the hydrocarbon world we saw diamonds become instantly popular with butane extraction and propane extraction few other methods to create diamonds and we had to find a way so we utilized heat pressure and mechanical separation how much a did you throw away before you figured out that's the craziest thing yeah well luckily we were actually using a lot of it in other products topicals edibles and other things of that nature because we were seeing the test results in our coconut oil and other things but we just didn't put two and two together it's crazy to think back on it but yeah we definitely threw a lot away we definitely use some for purposes that we shouldn't have been using it for you know in mechanical separation I always like to talk about allocations and this is maybe something we can take a little break on but allocations are extremely important and that was one of those allocations we were throwing away something that had a lot of value another allocation I talked about is when we're especially when we're talking about butane versus solvent list I used the strain blue dream for the perfect example you get a full indoor operation of blue dream you bring it into your lab and you've got the hydrocarbon guys next door butane extract guys and they're yielding 18 to 24 percent on this blue dream you bring that same exact blue dream into the water hash lab we might be yielding three to five percent on that blue dream and originally I just started this discussion about the trichomes structure whether it has a thick waxy cuticle or a longer trichome stalk but blue dream is one of those ones that has a long stalk a very small head and a thick waxy cuticle it does not yield well in water hash and this is just an example you may find the very specific cut that does do well in water hash but for general purposes aloft in times the blue dream that we see is just not good for allocating towards water hash it's great for hydro carbon and so the same thing goes with allocations on the back end we found that that white powdery substance that we were taking away in our bags and keeping the clean clear beautiful gold rosin you know we were throwing that away as Phil mentioned and we've now learned to allocate that and utilize that THCA that we're thrown away any other questions we got lit up here so I don't all right so we're used to you know the full spectrum like 45min 160th you guys to play with like the 1/16 plus for separation because you know I I found some light goods you know find some good heads in the ones bigger heads who beat our dicks have you guys tried explored that so you're saying you know do we basically isolate the 160-180 micron and you know press that out and see the quality of that rosin and do stuff like that or separate or keep it like yeah I mean personally yeah I've actually just recently I mean it was some indoor but it was isolated 180 micron from an OG which is to me not a common thing to find for ice water hash a 180 you and it was incredible it actually put out about 91% return on the rosin so it was the most most impressive 180 I've ever seen when he talked about that return on the rosies talking about the actual trichome head being pressed into rosin and when you're talking about a 91% return that means there's barely any waxy cuticle it means you're barely losing anything you start with 5 grams and you're yielding about four point two four point five or four point six grams now I'm horrible with mass start with the gram and you know you're getting 0.9 one bag there you go but but yeah I mean for the most part a lot of strains I do I like the 180 I like the 150 I think it really depends on your methods you know gentle agitation depending on strains and knowing what you're working with the environment you're working in and controlling all your variables I think the 180 and the 150 are really good because for the most part I usually isolate everything depending on what I'm doing but I find in the end a lot of things end up just making it into the same batch because what I'll do is I'll isolate and then you know I'll press everything out and I'll separate everything by quality you know so not quality just by color but call you by terpene profile always have to dab it taste I noticed the 40 the 40 micron is usually not my favorite I like to keep that little separate because I don't know if it's more fats and lipids that are in it that's giving it a certain taste but I mean it's still great oil but to me I think keeping the 40 separated is better than keeping the 180 and the 150 separated because to me the 180 and the 150 have a high terpene profile to me those have like my favorite terms you know like if you never catch 150 or 180 those are just man lucky and to really you know summarize that it's so strained dependent you know I was actually speaking of your og cush that you'll did amazing in your 180 bag we ran some lemon cush Himalayan lemon cush it was a strain that was brought back by a soldier friend of ours that we ran in Colorado for a long time this one round that one of my growers grew wielded over two ounces of full melt in the 220 bag okay so anything's possible and to go back on what Phil said I really like to emphasize that we actually do the same thing we separate all of the microns I run a couple 220 bags we actually run a couple there and in the washing machine just to make sure we've gotten all that plant material I then run a 185 a 160 a 120 you know sometimes the hundred the 90 that you know sometimes to run a strain that we've never ran before I'll put all my bags in there I'll try and separate as many as I can because each strain each grower each medium is gonna be a little different even from one row you know you might be running the same strain in a grow house but have LEDs in one row have your HPS and another you're gonna see differences even there's differences from the top of your plant to the bottom of the plant as far as the trichome formation the amount of oils in them the size of the trichome head so we really like to especially when we're running a strain that we haven't run before is run all of those different micron sizes you can combine them in the end I can't combine them you know if you've started with only three three microns you can't separate them sorry beforehand so we like to start out with as many bags as we can see where the heads are lying and then eventually on that next run when you're running that same material from that same garden you can remove some bags you don't have to use all those bags and I think right there I think what that is in my opinion is every strain has a different head and tell you know so it's like the heads the cream and the tail is gonna be your butt end it might be it's lower quality you know but for the most part when you see the head and tail together like a full-spectrum hash oil something it's a good product but when you actually pull that tail end out of like let's just say for instance a headband we're running and that you know you can run seven eight spins you know 30-minute spins and you're still pulling and you know five spins in it was just quality but you can see it's getting darker more contaminants but then you get to the rosin and you're pressing everything out and everything's just coming out gold regardless of the hash you know and and you know it's all about the yield so you got a hundred grams of high-quality and 10 grams of just some darker oil other strains you know you'll notice regardless of the yield you might got the same yield off that strain as far as hash but it comes to pressing you know you have more wax membrane to those heads so therefore you're getting more more tail in with that head so you know you're get looking at like let's just say you get 80 grams and 30 grams of tail in because that's the darker oil yeah and that's that's more when you're looking for like when people are separating their Roslin's you know having like you know their their heads - and then just the edible grade for me I kind of I'm more of a full spec guy I kind of like to keep everything together as long I like to keep the tail end out and I think that's an important part of extraction is the head and tell regardless of what we're doing rosin ice water extraction ahead and tell it's all about knowing when to poll and what to keep separated a mature grower as anybody here ever explored with ultrasonic cleaning for washing hash like definitely actually we've yeah the question is has anybody utilized ultrasonic cleaning with hash or ultrasonic technology and we've used on actually a number of scales and people companies that I know right now are utilizing that technology in a number of ways as well I'll touch on a few things we had a company come in to our facility we were one of the first licensed facility blessed to be one of the first licensed facility in the world in Colorado and so a lot of companies from the cold brew industry from the wine industry beer industry started contacting us because we were able to do license protected R&D and an ultrasonic agitation company or cavitation company similar technology contacted us from the cold brew industry and brought in machinery into our facility and we started playing around with it unfortunately cannabis is a lot different than coffee and hops etc and we just kept having clogging issues with that machine but I saw value in it so what we did use utilize that cavitation or that ultrasonic technology not to separate the heads from the material like we initially wanted to and I still do think that there's value there and I think that there is viability and I think that you could do that but instead we ended up because it costs so much money for the machinery and to keep making these diodes bigger and these passageways bigger because the cannabis had to flow but we wanted to get an exact temperature there were a lot of variables that cost a lot millions of dollars really in R&D that this cavitation company didn't want to just keep shelling out but we ended up finding out that on a very high level turning up that cavitation device that ultrasonic device we're able to actually fully homogenize the oil into the solution so for edible products for topical products there's a lot of value in ultrasonic agitation and cavitation I still do think there's value in separating the oil via this technology if you guys aren't familiar basically ultrasonic agitation is a wave that is so intense that it can actually separate oil from wall they've used it in actually separating rivers and things of that nature on a larger scale ie cavitation but we saw this value because we started turning it up and actually breaking the trichome heads in water which would be our solution and now we have oil and water in one solution we started going back to okay how do they get oil out of water and you know we started playing with some of the technology that they're using in the oceans to get you know spills out of the oceans these polymer tubes basically that run on the bottom of the ocean that are pulling the oil out of the ocean and we played with that but we weren't seeing the yields we wanted to see I still do think that there's a lot to do there and there is a future for it so keep playing that's what it's all about I didn't get to it I didn't get there yet myself but I think one of y'all could share share share with everyone put it up on the forums throw it up on Instagram tag these guys they'll put it out there that's what it's about man that's what it's about we found each other somehow we found compassion both both of us found compassion so keep spreading knowledge for real and stick around today because I think we definitely have some more discussions a little roundtable with a few more hash makers in the building but we're gonna take a little split break I think right about now", "c2zn8hrEVdo": "yo yo yo what is good you guys welcome back to another live stream getting ready to get down with this mendo breath wash it's been a long ass [ __ ] day but it don't matter we got [ __ ] to do we got to get them that grizzy so got the freeze dryer i just started it up right now it started its freeze cycle so it's going to take approximately 20 to 30 minutes to get down to an appropriate temperature to be ready to handle the hash in the meantime i've got everything else set up we'll go over that in a minute once we get everybody else in here and uh we're gonna be washing two pounds of some mendo breath nug that was cultivated by hambone gardens and uh dudes an excellent grower smashed it with this [ __ ] mendo breath and the um the wedding crasher he has coming down right now [ __ ] phenomenal um so i'll be running a few pounds of that next but um yeah we're gonna get it done what's up loan loan i was just talking about you earlier i need a paddle bro i need a custom paddle pay you cash your dabs whatever just let me know i need a custom paddle made bro so uh we're going to chill for a moment i'm going to take a dab or two we're gonna get everything kind of started and then uh once it's time to start i may go ahead and put it on members only mode so that way as i'm working if i look up and i see a question i know it's from one of the members and i can make sure i respond if i have time or at least get back to it lego you're gonna get in this runts guts right now yeah i feel like it's almost a sin almost to mix it with other [ __ ] but i'm gonna mix it with some of this ice cream cake oh [ __ ] [ __ ] balls isn't it crazy these two different rosins came out of the same room harvested at the same time processed the same exact way and they have such differences in color texture and smell and potency i mean everything it's not a one grammar it's a 0.3 maybe price machine is playing catch up right now i probably went through about 250 to 300 pounds of ice today getting the reservoir ready to go if it was summer and i didn't have this ice machine i probably wouldn't be making ash right now there's just no [ __ ] way i'd be able to keep up you guys make me wash too often damn it now i'm going to throw you down here for this melt shot because it's not often that i do the runt and the ice cream cake together in harmony i'm gonna sit down though because i feel like i'm about to [ __ ] myself over so hard so let me just sit my ass down right now okay yep am i comfortable yep i'm comfortable now cheers you guys [Music] oh yes let us go cheers it's all about to be uh on youtube bro uh you know when you blow smoke out and you think you're done then you go to talk or cough and more smoke just keeps on [ __ ] coming out that's how those low temp dabs hit all right let's get things started i gotta remember where the [ __ ] i'd be putting the camera in [ __ ] welcome to the daily dabbers all eyes on me all right let's get you guys so you guys know this setup i went ahead and bought some five gallon buckets today instead of using the uh big 20 gallon lids we're gonna use the five gallons since it's only two pounds we're not washing if it was three or four pounds i would maybe use the 20s but the fives should be able to handle it i gave them all a good alcohol bath today rinsed them out with real good cold water and made new bucket lids like i said so now each one has its own all the way down to the bottom so i'm using a 220 here then a 160 i'll collect everything between 160 and 220 and use it for edibles or test pressed whatever and then i have a 45 everything between 45 and 160 i'm going to use for full spectrum rosin and then 25 to 45 we may or may not end up using it we'll collect the first two to three washes if it's dumping we'll keep collecting if it's not we'll pull it out and not use it that's also going to be for test pressing so we got that and then underneath here we got a little pump a little eco plus pump power cable comes out this way it's plugged in when i need it to turn it on um and then the dump comes out this way a little ball valve here i'll turn it on when i need it and i drop it into here and uh got a p-trap and that goes out to my drain outside which drains it out in a way we got a huge 160 gallon res with ice cold water in there a couple hundred pounds of ice this [ __ ] has a jacket but it needs a beanie because it's sweating got the cold sweats and then we got the avanti not gonna be washing in the avanti today we're going to be washing by hand with the spoon 20 gallon wrapped in a pele using rosin evolution all mesh bags 5 gallon here 20 gallon here and uh yeah that's the plan just got it sitting on a cooler down here so it's stable and it's more at an appropriate height for me and i'm [ __ ] killing my back you know what i'm saying only thing is i wish this was longer and bigger and had a better handle come on loan where you at dog take care of me baby take care of me [Music] so what are we gonna do we're gonna do a couple things here finish prepping [Music] probably gonna need to add more ice in here once we get the where was i gonna put this over here like come on dog how high are you probably gonna get more ice in here later once this gets going spoon get it cold now we're gonna start prepping this okay oh yeah i'm gonna make some rso and i finally found my mason jar i'm gonna use it's my old gallon that we used to keep on the counter to drink water to fit perfect all those mace or all those hash pucks and it's got a spout even perfect i don't think he weighed them 100 percent i'm not sure if you mark them no so i'll grab the scale and get these weight up oh yeah you're gonna come with me in the house oh my magnificent wife brought it back outside to my workstation without me having to ask her and i didn't have to go get it that's because she's better than if it was something of hers that [ __ ] would still be out here i'd still have it she'd be pissed you guys know how this goes if you're married [Music] you know just that's just the way it is so anyways i'm glad she brought it back let's get this weighed out black and white of your logo yep got you okay whatever you need please i got you let's make it happen okay we're grams we're tearing out we got that [ __ ] okay 530 so 515 in this one and 515 and this one as well they're both exactly the same so about a thousand so the quality on the bud i'll show you oh [ __ ] [ __ ] wow i'm glad this is what i'm going next jesus that [ __ ] is dang that answer your question woof the smell it's like sweet sweet caramel gas this fire so we're going to get some ice on this first layer and then some bud some ice and there's some bud a ninja mice and then some buttons and some ice okay so we'll be back let me grab some ice so so [Music] [Music] two inch layer on the bottom here i guess i could show you super fire job on this man super fire job let's see how she dumps okay let's go grab some more ice i'll be back you guys can chill chill [Music] chill probably gonna have to grab my five gallon bucket okay we'll do one more just to make sure it's fully covered [Music] um so that's good we're gonna want this out of the way what am i stupid what what am i stupid almost forgot a bag and you know what's dope is he dried it the way i asked him to he dried it exactly how i asked him to and it came out exactly how i thought it would get some more ice so so [Music] so [Music] cool [Music] before we fill this up and get this heavy as [ __ ] we're gonna move around here [Music] hey i'm [ __ ] freezing my tits off already and this is even my thick one i'm about to run upstairs and get my thick one the [ __ ] thin one right here the summer one all right [Music] tetris tetris it's nothing like playing a tetris [Music] tetris yes yes chill right there chill right there um so i mean i can put you guys on the headset if you for want chest strap [Music] just sift it do some paint roller tech [Music] [Music] chef so [Music] there's like a fat ass nerd right there oh [Music] [Music] yeah goat i gotta get set up for streaming i'm gonna buy a whatever i need [Music] make it all good issue is my modem keeps dropping the internet connection it's not my router it's my modem because the internet says where the the motor or the router sees me stays connected [Music] the ice is so [ __ ] clear i couldn't even tell that most of the buds right here actually submerged already this first this first wash is going to be tough boy there's a lot of ice in here and this [ __ ] paddle is too small for this dub i just want to get all this submerged not sitting on the top don't worry i'll make the ocean sounds go i'll do it for the avanti all right that is about as we gonna get right there boy i tell you would cool 20 gallon 220 yeah took me three years to get the gopro yeah well back when i first had a gopro like the hero 3 you couldn't stream from the gopro at least not directly from it and i wasn't into streaming and all that background so i had no idea all right we're gonna let those hydrate i need it there we easy go to get that all underneath there all the ice is in the bag and now i just want to make sure that all of these buds stay underneath the water level so that they get hydrated it's so the water is so [ __ ] clear i mean it looks like you're not even looking through water almost at least on the gopro that i'm looking through she looks wild what's up no limit giveaway winner i've been getting so many copyright strikes let's try not to get one tonight what do you say got water on my laptop i'm gonna take another dab everybody ready everybody matching [Music] [Applause] [Music] two two two um [Music] silly [Music] is i gotta turn the bluetooth speaker on real quick yo this [ __ ] blood smells like kind of like like a baby ate too many caramels and then doo-doo it's straight like doo doo gas you know what it's all about you ever have a screen that smells like baby diapers like hot baby diapers [Music] sorry i'm trying to get my music going through the right [ __ ] [ __ ] i gotta close my browsers real fast i hate when that happens stream back up now this back up hmm [Music] uh way too hard [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] welcome jeff to the daily dabbers [Music] yes [Music] foreign oh yeah [Music] [Music] even while i'm smoking the rice i just keep smelling this foul-ass [ __ ] in such a good way [Music] so dc cleaner on here keep it fresh [Music] get your first bowl run [ __ ] yeah [Music] don't you stop well once you start you're never gonna be able to stop bro making your own is like the most addictive [ __ ] ever [Music] the like final bit of gratification that you get especially when you grow it and then you like go through all that work to process it it's a really good feeling you know it's good [Music] [Music] so [Music] we're gonna do a quick battery swap to make sure you guys are at 100 real quick before i start this [ __ ] [Music] [Music] boom [Music] [Music] foreign and so you don't watch me struggle with the [ __ ] gopro mount i'll go ahead and set that up first [Music] it looks like you lost another one all right mystic toilet water for my stress [Music] is [Music] foreign [Music] um [Music] capital one checking and savings accounts have no fees or minimums and a top-rated banking

down and if i'm not mistaken this may have just been a small tester tank i don't even think this was a full sin i think this was a tester the wedding crasher you pulled down [ __ ] fire you guys are going to go bananas over that honestly i'm only going to be running a couple pounds of it you guys might want to start putting in your pre-orders now because if there's a big enough demand then i might be able to run some more for you guys but if it's another two pounds that's just gonna be gone like i'm not even gonna put it out there for nobody it's just gonna be gone off rip off vip clientele it's crazy but estimated yield today um you know going off of the runs that i did previously with the runts that were pretty damn frosty um you know 20 average return from starting material to hash and then from there um you know average 75 to 80 percent back as rosin so [Music] we'll go from there we'll see probably about 130 to 150 grams of rosin out of this when all said and done but it really just depends not everything dumps the same some stuff you think it's gonna dump really really good because it's frosty but not always the case but this is [ __ ] gaff i can the smell is just all up through my nose still like sweet caramel baby [ __ ] tammy you neglected to tell me there was a baby [ __ ] smell in there it says sweet caramel [Music] flyer this is like sweet caramel and baby [ __ ] there's no just floating by [Music] [Music] keep on floating bye [Music] [Music] dried before freezing is the only way my personal opinion is if you're washing it fresh frozen you are losing out on the maximum potential because i feel like once you let it dry you get rid of some of that water content the terpenes become more concentrated you lose that chlorophyll taste i haven't had fresh frozen yet that didn't have that green fresh frozen paint to it so drying is a must in my opinion quick dry though not a normal 14 day dry like a six seven day dry works good uh-oh internet might have dropped you're gonna need oh it reconnected huh seeing here people always ask me if there's like a way to stir it personally find your groove whatever the [ __ ] works to make the motion in the ocean you do it i personally like to do a grabbing motion so i'll push all this down and stir it and come up on this back end push down stir come up on the bathroom so that's that's kind of my technique and then go back the other way you get you know at the top layer you know i'm only about three or four inches below the surface right here i want to go oh you know that's bottomed out right there i don't need to go bottomed out but every once in a while i do want to go to the bottom and pull that material up so i can mix that right push down and pull towards me that's another one i like to do [Music] [Music] so uh [Music] oh yeah oh yeah we in here [Music] ah [Music] is [Music] oh yeah i don't know if you see them i see it i see them heads in there and there's a lot of them so we're going to let this chili chill chill you know the dividend diversity in honor of our 50th anniversary and while we do that scholarship funds because we believe in the pursuit of purpose and the difference you make in the world [Music] what [Music] you let your wife borrow the scale one time [Music] don't do that oh [Music] time to fold all [ __ ] days [Music] so [Music] so [Music] number two ain't no feet [Music] my oh no mystic needs to feature me on one of their songs i got bars man i can't afford that feature though can't afford that feature i want 10 racks for every [ __ ] four bars [Music] all right trash let's take a dab of roni eat your bronies yeah bro this is mystic [Music] [Music] um [Music] i feel you ain't smoking and uh [Music] that [ __ ] in there y'all don't know he's talking about me right [Music] i wish [Music] [Music] i'm dabbing runts and i'm smelling mindo woo wee woo wow [Music] oh [Music] [Music] so so the way that i do this is i use the avanti as a storage vessel can i move you over there that far i don't know maybe let me see yeah so i use the avanti as a storage vessel [Music] [Music] [ __ ] cold in here like foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so what i'm gonna do is i didn't realize you're like right there on my [ __ ] ball sack but i'm gonna empty the uh the washer real quick because uh this is a fresh run and that's what we do in between every run you guys know this stick that drain hose in there plug in the washer turn it on switch to drain mode boom it's going to start draining so i'm going to take the plug for the pump that's in here and i'm going to go ahead and put it in to my power strip here now when i need it i turn it on when i donate it i turn it off and i obviously just blew that down with over 130 programs and certificates gives you the opportunity to start or continue your education wherever you are what do i have plugged we're committed to making your experience english and rewarding when you choose open you join a community where success and affordability okay that is right now one more time this time i'm gonna make sure that i'm getting fresh cold water out of the [Music] drain [Music] it's 58 degrees in here [Music] and dabs got me feeling warm [Music] we haven't changed [Music] [Music] cool yes i smell it boys i always smell the water in here it's not a habit i don't want it to smell stale at all this smells stale then you got a [ __ ] problem but i rinse pulled out water through it before and after everything i do cold ro water it's deionized and desterized so came out nice and clear and the reason i do that is because i'm getting ready to use it as a storage vessel for the bag that i'm about to pull out which means that i need it to be very clean you know what i'm saying clean and fresh [Music] [Music] my process for this is not a a gracious one by any means not at the moment especially because s9 steel works just went mia and hasn't answered any dms in weeks about that 2400 vessel i was trying to purchase from them they told me oh it's going to ship in a week and then [ __ ] m.i.a so i'm kind of upset with them you know what i mean that's kind of [ __ ] right [Music] [Music] and [Music] so fantastic i've been lifting [ __ ] trash cans full of ice up over my shoulder all [ __ ] day long filling this up i think it took [ __ ] like 10 of these at least if not more now the advantage i had with my other one when i was running um the 20 gallon catch containers is it was a lot easier to catch all of this but i'm lifting this up so i could use a pump i could scoop this [ __ ] out honestly [Music] but let me see how heavy this is first go from there i'm going to come up with a more disabled veteran friendly way you got what i mean so i put this in the corner so it can't roll away [Music] and then this is pretty solid i'm just going to take this up kind of set it on here slow pour and hopefully it doesn't go away you know like [ __ ] 20 gallons of water compassionate [Music] [Music] [ __ ] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] oh my god let me show you what's coming out of the bottom of this [ __ ] bin right now oh i'm gonna change my underwear first [ __ ] god damn son [Music] you guys already know what i'm gonna do with hash like that right you guys already i'm skeeting all over y'all bangers with this [ __ ] drop [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] is [Music] so before i filter what's in the bags i'm gonna fill this up so that everything in here is gonna stay really really cold it's gonna stay colder when it's filled up with uh water versus when it's open air right now so look at what we're catching in the [ __ ] 220 come on look where's this y'all see that [ __ ] 220 come on bruh you dumping in here we dumping in here good job you pulled it at the perfect [ __ ] time my perfect [ __ ] time that guy [Music] [Music] uh [Music] i need a big ass hammy slap trying to put a pork chop up here [Music] and actually you would be the first co-lab that i have a sticker up on my wall from wow oh that's not enough water i'm gonna go less water than last time but more water than this [Music] oh [Music] here's here's a good trick people say how do you know if you have enough ice you have enough water you want enough ice that it's gonna keep the water as cold as possible right around like you know 30 38 degrees is cool enough you know 28 to 38 is good you don't want to go above 42 and uh [Music] make sure it's covered the material enough to where you can easily move the material around with your stirrer with one hand and then you know move all the material it's not like they're fighting it just kind of fluidly move [Music] and it's covered and uh yeah that's good enough and then now i'm just going to take the back of the spoon and kind of push everything down right below the surface this is where having that ice on top helps because it helps a little [ __ ] sweet there it uh helps hold the bud down underneath the surface of the water so if you need to add more ice now is a good time [Music] okay we're gonna let this chili chill chill and then after uh we get done sifting this we'll come back and stir this [Music] um [Music] i need to go inside and get batteries because the 10 more washers staying [ __ ] dead right now for free visit minute clinic at cvs today no cost flu shots with most insurance restrictions apply so clinic.com replacing tetris here you ready [Music] [Applause] him [Music] takes me back to high school buckingham [Music] [Music] [Music] now i'm going to open up this valve yo this thing the magnets are like going like [ __ ] ah that's not what she said [Music] is [Music] right sorry i'm trying to get you guys set up [Music] i have to sponsor this man and get him some proper recording equipment all right that's good enough [Music] so [Music] [Music] this is the 220 my boys [Music] [Music] what [Music] trash [Music] alcohol wipes [Music] [Music] oh yeah [Music] there we go that goes back a nice one this goes to the side now here we have our 160. this is going to be test press material most likely but we'll see what happens [Music] it's up to the farmer what happens really with it it could become it's usually the way i do it is it's test press and then depending on the quality it either gets mixed in with the rest because some strains really do feel better at the higher microns so depending on how well it does you know it'll either go with everything else or it'll just get made into edibles or something [Music] it could be pills could be whatever stash for the homies right like a lot of times this 160 will make fire head stacks for the homies and you don't have to dip into your uh you know your normal full spectrum spot it's not gonna hit the fan [Music] okay cool so there's just not a whole lot of that and that is good good good that means majority of what we want is in the 45 where it belongs [Music] taking this where's deals at deals is in here [Music] shout out to the cultivator everybody [Music] okay oh my god oh i love it when the 160 comes out looking like this you guys remember how the runts 160 came out looking well hammy's mendo it came out looking just as good i do not i have never said that about another person's material that i've ran except for my own like straight up be honest as [ __ ] call it snobby call it what you want but i've ran a lot of [ __ ] material and it takes one hell of a [ __ ] grower to pull off 160 micron hash that comes out looking like that like and i'm not even in good light damn it but it's a little [ __ ] caked up mountain the [ __ ] white 160 here looking proper you guys know because you've seen me process enough material you know not a lot of collab material comes out looking that good period and that's the 160 we're not even on to the real deal holyfield yet so set this one aside now you're not ready for this 45. [Music] [Music] oh [Music] we're gonna get rid of some of this water first so we're gonna pick up both the 25 and the 45. give them a little shimmy shimmy [Music] hammy um what ppfd were you running for your 11 13 do you know what dli you were hitting sorry i'm loud right there oh [ __ ] the wife's gonna come down and not be able to walk wife's coming to take it down [Music] oh [Music] some people don't go as long as me on the first wash i like to get all the chlorophyll that i can out on the first wash the first wash was always going to have the most contaminant it doesn't matter how long you wash it for so you might as well just go ahead and get all the pores all out that you can [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm going to spend a little extra time just washing it down making sure i wash my floor full out the best of my ability remember what i tell you guys you're not just filtering the water you're washing the hash you're not washing the nugs okay you're you're washing the house [Music] ready baby do you have shoes on you got chocolates on okay cool come on in baby they can't see you it's pointing straight down [Music] i think it's cold i don't know it's 57 degrees in here [Music] [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] who's your dad [Music] jesus take the wheel i still got work to do you swap the deck real quick on the banger [Music] [Music] those of you that are hanging out i go live every day every morning doing gross [ __ ] processing [ __ ] talking [ __ ] doing [ __ ] just cool [ __ ] man we got some cool people come check it out [Music] it's called the daily dab [Music] i put it on members only mode most of the time where everybody could watch and you know but only members can chat and ask questions and you know but for the first 20 or 30 minutes it's usually open to everybody [Music] so come on over and check it out [Music] wash the [ __ ] half don't just filter it wash that [ __ ] homies wash wash it wash it wash it wash it how much water is going in that bucket it's gone you don't even know it's empty all right [Music] [Music] um you guys aren't ready for this [ __ ] i'm not ready for this [ __ ] watch excuse me excuse me chef chef i'd like one mindo breath hash burrito please hold the cheese extra salt for all of my haters that's a fat dumper for our first year my boy tammy who washes your hash like me let me hear you say it nobody breaking babe nobody i'm just playing [Music] but i do it with love and care like it's my own like it's my [ __ ] home you guys want a high def picture of that from the phone um [Music] let me turn off that [Music] i almost forgot that i unplugged my sump pump out there so i had to go plug that back in [Music] one [Music] um [Music] [Music] so [Music] yeah i i found out you [ __ ] yes you weren't in here when i was telling you you're a dick that's the first thing i [ __ ] said is it smells like a straight hot baby diaper oh funny he dried it with my quick drape my quick dry technique baby i told you guys i've been doing it that way for five [ __ ] years now five [ __ ] years let somebody tell you that they've been doing it longer this fresh frozen [ __ ] shenanigan ring what in the [ __ ] is going on with that all right we'll capture the rest of this next [ __ ] go around okay i got it now we're going to see what the 25 looks like and if it's worth um keeping at all and if not we're going to get rid of that [ __ ] and not mess with it because it slows down the filter process for everything else i thought yeah pretty much everything else above it so great [ __ ] baby [ __ ] you know um my buddy goodbye [ __ ] has a cut of ice cream cake that's the exact same [ __ ] way and it is your [ __ ] god awful stanky good [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [ __ ] you 25 micron appreciate you savage um so savage said how long did it take me to get where i'm at now any growing tips you want to work your way up so basically um i started growing at the end of 2014 with my very first grow and my very first time getting high i started with a 4x4 tent a 600 watt air cooled hps and a 15 gallon tote where i did deep water culture with two plants [Music] i ran a strain called gold leaf from a site called i love growing marijuana and i had acupuncture gold and something else and off that 600 watt i ended up yielding uh 21 ounces um which i was [ __ ] thrilled about because my first grow in a [ __ ] 15 gallon dwc show [Music] so the 25 is going to go on the same tray as the 160 on the other side though so growing tips i would say do as much research as you can about basic plant science and plant nutrition photosynthesis right what the different nutrients do for the plant how they show up as deficiencies or toxicities all of these things have been thoroughly researched and documented in scientific ways not on forums that you can get a really really good understanding of what you're going to be doing before you go to do it which is going to put you ahead of the game and you're not just going to be doing something based on the fact that somebody told you to do it when it comes to your grow you're going to do something based off of somebody recommended something and your research shows x y or z so you know then you choose how you want to buy it or not apply it but um you know it just i would say stick to learning from like dot edu's you know look up just scholarly journals um try and find out pretty much as much science as you can about the plant the anatomy of the plant and its functions the circadian rhythm you know i would say start off by picking a very simple nutrient program like a two-part salt based program it'll be cheap effective and um reliable consistent athena is good um hvg like ham bones running is really good all right it's gonna be a long one folks i think i'm gonna have to uh [Music] all right this chat is bumping i don't know how you guys are keeping up with it i'm on top chat right now i just realized that all right so now i'm on live chat let me get this out of the way it's still got a small amount of draining it's doing but not a whole lot better yet oh no don't die i plugged you in at that three percent i plugged you in though if it dies i'm coming right back y'all already know baby so oh my god i forgot to move that over for the wife so now i gotta go over here move it from over here over here [Music] anymore i cannot wait to move into a bigger [ __ ] area i underestimated my own growth and didn't realize i was gonna need as much space as i do you know here's what it is it's not a bad thing good thing no problem right first yeah it's time management how you want to throw your bag like that's why i have a nine to five hound bone has a nine to five andy hustles you know what i'm saying you gotta do what you gotta do when you got [ __ ] family to provide for and you wanna live a certain lifestyle and provide you know a certain amount of security and for your future and your children's future you gotta you gotta hustle you gotta put in that overtime you gotta sacrifice you know like tonight i'm gonna probably get three hours of sleep if that and that's okay i'm gonna wake up early tomorrow with the kids so my wife could sleep in and i'm gonna [ __ ] hustle throughout the day like it's another day so that's just what you do [Music] how cold did you get the room at the end tammy [Music] i like how far the it calyxed out i don't see a lot of people crown their buds out as much as you do it's something that i was taught to do as well if your calyx's crown out towards the end you nailed it and if you don't know what a crowned out calyx is it's probably because you're getting that pgr [ __ ] where it just looks like a [ __ ] golf ball with sprinkles on it i get so tired of people trying to tell me that they don't pgr their bud but it literally has no type of calyx terrain there's no it's just a straight just [ __ ] dense ass hard ass smooth surface that doesn't happen [Music] naturally one thing i've experimented with a couple times that works really well if you have the ability to chill your reservoir a little bit and you start tapering it towards flush it'll start bringing those colors out a little bit more and i noticed with the temperature drop it affects you know some plants more than others because they're more exposed to that temperature and the wind and they get that wind chill coldness but if you hit them at the root zone it affects like almost all of the plants the same way and so you can drop the internal temperature of the plant and get some of that purpling the same way and get it more across the whole canopy you know you do it in combination with the air temps just don't drop it too much in the root zone or otherwise you're gonna pretty much like stop uptake i ran a whole entire crop at um 58 degrees which is the temperature at which you can hit 100 dissolved oxygen supposedly and uh since i ran it at 58 degrees since the start of clone i didn't run into any issues with uptake and they were super productive and uh one of my best fields did that aeroponics [Music] nice oh my god smack that ass mindo sexy [ __ ] [Music] yeah you guys take advantage of the fact that um we actually have the grower on right now that's a very rare occasion that we get the grower on with us so definitely take advantage of that we're gonna let that chili chill chill for a minute [Music] [Music] froze it all without drying ah that sucks too late [Music] too now i have to run inside grab a drink real quick we're gonna let this settle for a second i'll be right back and we're gonna continue to party [Music] [Music] don't really know", "W47OFHgTWpM": "this is what you call against the grill invasion oh yeah whoa Rama Green Lane yes JT kiss row

small EA I'm your host Andrew Friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of cannabis extract reviews it's so awesome that cannabis has been legalized in Canada and now we're able to have these new product categories like essential oils extracts all those great things that we've been waiting for with legalization 2.0 but luckily enough everybody in Canada has been able to grow their own for cannabis plants since October 17 2018 and it's totally legal to share with your friends and so I'm lucky to know few great rosin and hash makers now before we dive any deeper into that what is rosin rosin is the process of excreting an essential oil from cannabis using heat and pressure so under heated platen you squeeze cannabis and excrete its oil you could do that with hash as well in a more refined matter and these are ways that we've now developed a hierarchy of the quality of rosin and different names that are associated with them from flour rosin hash rosin and live rosin we'll dig into all those things later so today we have some wonderful hash frozen a full spectrum hash rosin I believe and this is from the Tom Cruise of rosin absolutely fantastic product here and what do we have ice cream cake number four an ice cream cake I believe is coming to us from seed junkie genetics and it is a cross of wedding cake at gelato 33 so now you with their back crosses you get a bunch of different cookies and mints in there I believe July through three has triangle mints or the wedding cake story and then there's some sunset sherbert in there some pink cookies bunch of different things that all add up to those great California strains that have put a lot of companies on the map so that's our ice cream cake number four hash rosin you can see in the bottom it just looks creamy and delicious I think this is handsome heat cure going on inside of it let's crack into it and see how it looks and see how it tastes mmm fantastic just punch it in your face right away doesn't that look awesome see it's wet and Turkey mmm looks so good on the nose it is just a gas bomb creamy rubber gas confectionary like cookie dough oh it smells almost like Neapolitan ice cream the vanilla the chocolate the strawberry ooh so so good so much gasps so much creaminess going on absolutely great genetics and so as a shout-out to the grower this is just incredibly smelling so bright and so fresh and excited which is crazy too because this isn't a live rosin this is a cured hash rosin or a dead rosin because the plant isn't alive Wow and then I get lavender I get fresh lavender and and like sweet chemicals and that rubber and that gas and that fruitiness and that creaminess mmm smells just delicious delicious I can't wait to taste this mmm the smell is actually making my mouth water that's how creamy and fragrant and overall yummy this is I don't have a better word for it so an extract like this you know there's there's not more that you much more that you can get off the nose off the appearance from the that just looks so cool before I dig into it sorry creamy delicious let's have ourselves a dab shall we oh and it's just bada in there it's it felt creamy when I moved it will take a video of me really playing in it because it's gonna be delicious I'm sure that is popping up in the corner wherever right now probably this one that one I don't ever remember but here's

other life forms or other planets a lot years away from Earth so honestly I think my opinion I'm gonna say yes there there is aliens on other planets is um how how would these aliens look they definitely have to be they definitely have to look different I'm assuming aliens are real I want to say I want to say aliens are real everyone just because I watch a lot of ancient aliens and everything they talked about makes sense it's just I've always been fascinated about if there is other life forms on different planets you know light-years away and I want to say there is you know just because we haven't reached reach them or we haven't been able to get the technology to explore other planets doesn't mean you know they don't exist I want to say they exist we've seen I've seen countless times of some type of signals signals earth gets from outer space and there's an episode of ancient aliens about Tesla Tesla the mad scientist how he was gonna make anti-gravity energy and how that was all gonna solve everyone's energy problem you know and then I don't know everyone everyone please go take take the time to go check that episode out on ancient aliens on Tesla's inventions discoveries or whatnot everyone I think there is alien extraterrestrial life on other planets different universes in the universe in the galaxy all that and I want to say earth used to have from watching ancient aliens I want to say earth used to have advanced technologies but from what I for my understanding it's um something keeps happening to earth where we get wiped out either by a comment asteroid whatever it is and Earth's ends up ends up being uninhabitable enough talking let's take this dab we're gonna go ahead and try to drop off we're going to go ahead and try to drop it in drop and dab everyone if I had my [ __ ] cap I would be able to car cap this unfortunately I lost my carb cap I need to buy a Clark cap and that little ball I was talking to you guys about this is

have to show you guys my other dabber my silicone dabber I have to clean it first before I show you guys the nail on that one is super cloudy I tried to burn it off as much as I could it wasn't happening I think it has to do with with me torching it to red-hot and yeah just basically torching it red-hot I looked it up and it has to do with yeah torching it red-hot it makes it so dark or cloudy or whatever for whatever reason I don't know comment if you do know but we are officially at 73 subscribers everyone cheers 273 subscribers and Counting I try to get thick smoke in here for you

"-t7wYRlkFVY": "yo what's good everybody jp here checking in respect my region.com back with episode two of a west coast youtube review featuring calya extracts rosin uh today's product we're gonna be reviewing the ice water extract it's a sun cake rosin your boy justin is back so we're gonna dive right in one dab each we'll talk about it two dabs four out of ten saying yeah yeah let's do it all right let's dive into at least some of the percentages real quick 68.5 on the thc 77.08 percent on the thca cbd 0.32 and cannabinoids total 77.08 so in terms of rosin is it the most potent rosin we've ever dabbed no it's not but no but sun cake right i have a feeling this is going to be cakey earthy piney maybe a little spicy hopefully yes yes and this is the i know the exact cross this is sunset sherbert crossed with ice cream cake something so right off the bat it's like an indica dominant height not a wedding cake okay cool you know and i feel i feel i feel this is gonna provide like a real nice that's some good color y'all hi that's my producer got that like snotty hash color right for sure this this definitely has a better color than the other one yeah right this just gives that look of like wow this is six star a grade what is the what's the um you check that out i mean i'll give you a little you know just so you can see it it doesn't say the uh the use the 70 or whatever yeah it should if this sticker might have uh oh it says it on the lid so you to 120 [Music] all right i'm excited man again i believe i've dabbed italia with you a couple times maybe two or three times at this point i i can't sit here and honestly say that i can name one strain or remember one and so at this point you know i'd really like to give these ones a fair shot and the attention that they deserve because i think you know calgary does get recommended as one of the best rosin brands in the state of california yeah when i go places so they definitely have the most exclusive drops uh it's something that's hard to acquire like it was hard to acquire that sweet and sour as well as this sun cake because uh it just sells out very quickly in the shops so now make sure you line it up this time there you go you see you see saw the first time it was showing you a lower number but once you get in the middle diameter of the banger gave you a proper reading all righty turf timer no octave no technology errors on this go we are doing it the right way all right also this is a highly educated quartz banger both of them are the same same thickness same everything so yeah this is the way the dad works on instagram italiax.com i like it i like it fresh frozen it says nothing but fresh frozen they're uh you know tell you that's why they call it it's ice water extract because it's coming from fresh frozen interesting interesting get your dad ready oh no [Music] you take dabs at whatever temperature you take that which is traditionally hot in my experience so we both have these turf timers set we both have these two timers set for 500 degrees okay once it hits 500 like to kind of let it sit till like 480 470 and then go in for the dab what is that that's usually how you get the nicest milk this is sun cake sunset sherbet times ice cream cake you dropped a video thank you sir you're gonna go no it's too hot still all right see i'm saying you take harder grabs harder sometimes when it's a little bit bigger you might you got to go like 20 degrees a little you know that's a nice milk i've been dabbing rosin since you were in diapers that's a nice melt yo look at that oh let me tell you it is delicious that [ __ ] is loud yo i do that [ __ ] [ __ ] smack me in the face oh wow mine still says 490 484 479 475 all right so in terms of the flavor that i'm getting sweet sweet pineness sweet sweet gassy earth and in terms of like the kind of high that i'm experiencing it's it's both energetic and relaxing in terms of the body height right it really does wash over your body and i had you saw me crack my back earlier before this episode oh my goodness wow this is wow took away all the aches that i had because i literally just had so much pain a second ago i had to roll on my back wow gone yo wow what do you think hit me with more than one word on this okay this is this is you know this is more than terpy this is like where you're like you're like trying to figure out like what is that is that vanilla frosting is that is that like a cookie you know but um ice cream cake and sunset sugar you said yeah that's delicious so super super i like the chirping profile if if this was a girl this would be my type um and i definitely go for this one over the sweet and sour because the sweet and sour was you know i think by the name is kind of like hybrid sweet and sour i like sweet this is some cake this is the crust it's it's a different kind of high at the end of the day this is ice cream cake gassy pine sweet gassiness i mean makes you want to go back for more like that we have a second dab to review it out of 10. well my i went like super low in my [ __ ] oh so you still have a second down today all right well [ __ ] okay pass me that torch really yeah you had to see that was the last little bit yeah and that tastes like i'm telling you i get that i get the really nice vanilla ice cream i still have the taste of it all right college yeah i still even need a vanilla ice cream on that side is this the first dab where you don't actually need a second dab or almost like sun cake they should have called this your angel was that angel cake they should have called this [ __ ] like heaven cake vanilla [ __ ] clouds it is sweet tiny gassy the nose on it is wonderful like as soon as you start like that's the word nutmeg i was like what smells that word that's that's not the side of this wow it's literally loud that's what i'm saying it hit when you smell it you're you're like your eyes squint yeah it's impressive i have a score of mine out of ten the second dab is not going to do it you know aside from human error [ __ ] it up so for me my score out of 10 is going to be 9.5 that would that's my score no no you told me what what genetics this is but it needs to say it on there yes and then i need the terpene information on there and that's the last two points for me the last half point point two five each i got you this is a problem that's a perfect product i would i want to dock them for the branding instead but repeatedly over and over people recommend kalyan as one of the best and so am i always at this point it doesn't matter the bartenders don't care that it looks like this they still think it's one of the best so i'm not going to take anything for that right 9.5 for me where you at i'm at 9.5 as well i'm at 9.5 as well i think uh wonderful i think yeah like really you hit it on the t with exactly what you said that if call it if you just provide that little bit of information so it would have been a 10 out of 10. like that yeah this is great you know and the packaging is not even that bright or like poppy but you know once you dip into it i mean you know what you're going to have a box like a cool acid wash box version of this but let's be real let's be real but it has to shout out to colleen because they the collabs they do are actually where they go crazy with the packaging this is actually a collab that's sweet and sour right that's the vesuvio gardens uh yeah yeah that's dope well big thank you guys you know calio you guys do a big shout out appreciate you guys checking in coming in hot at a 9.5 from both of us definitely go check out the sun cake rosin sweet and sour on the previous episode we'll see you guys in the next west coast video review respect my region justin curious love y'all peace", "hoRfHWxmiS4": "all right what is good we are back again with yet another and this one's low-key literally shortly just after we did the review for [Music] the uh the garlic breath so like i said i was gonna be trying to bring you guys constant content so whether i upload this on the same day or night if not the next you'll kind of get the idea of why i might be wearing the same pants and [ __ ] and shoes but anyways aside from all that i'm bringing you guys another oh leo review solventless olio about this mac uh mac or [ __ ] i'm not even high yet i bought this wreck at um what location was this this was at another golden meds location as well but honestly i don't even remember what um what location it was i think it was the peoria location if i'm not mistaken but oh yeah here wait here we go no it's not going to say but as you can see this at least i can like i don't have a receipt but you can see on the tag here the price but i paid 49 plus tax i think i want to say like out the door this came out to about well out the door this would come out to about like 55 after taxes and everything but because uh we were there there was like a deal that they had going on with like concentrates and stuff and so he gave me a discount for the concentrates in wax and stuff and then he even also applied it to the flower that i had as well which it wasn't even supposed to be applied to it but he just gave it to me along with the rest of that stuff so i do want to shout out that location i'm pretty sure it is the peoria location the one like right next to or off underneath the highway so go check them out go support them they're definitely [ __ ] dope the people they're dope um yeah i mean you already know what the box looks like so the wax though getting into the wax the gmo 70 premium rosin testing that oh i literally had it set so that way i didn't have to twist it off and now it's like stuck on there you see so i have been dabbing at this because you know me i can't help myself i can never resist opening some of this [ __ ] but look at that she's looking very saucy saucy but more like you know nice and buttery and light in color golden she's she's beautiful she smells good really good it's funny because this is gmo like the other the gmo and the garlic breath as you could tell you kind of just get an idea of the kind of strains that i like at least so that's what she's looking like for 50 bucks of some premium top tier kind of from a brand that's good you know top tier [ __ ] can't beat it cannot beat it so we're gonna go ahead and pack us up a dab of this and get going for the day because we obviously still haven't smoked a joint left but oh yeah you guys already know comment like subscribe any uh products you want to see or that you know of that you're familiar with and want to see checked out leave them down below and let me know we out thought i was gonna end it but honestly i figured i'll go ahead and give you guys the preview of the dab itself go ahead and take it and take it with you with y'all but it's not like they're shooting somebody out there that's probably the garbage that they're tossing somebody's doing something in the dumpster or something breaking down some kind of crap but the gmo so cheers to everyone out there that's smoking and talking with us this stuff tastes man just fantastic as well so i always recommend grabbing any olio or 710 labs that you can get your hands on if you're ever out there for sure don't ever pass it up squadly a1 gotta get the q-tips on deck for all my e-rig users you know what's good also let me know down below what you guys think you prefer carla or peek puffco let me know and is it worth getting the pro i'm thinking about moving up but i haven't made i haven't made the decision yet i haven't pulled the trigger so i'm pretty content with this the regular one it works pretty good for now so that's the olio again do not snooze or pass up on any although you ever see if you can afford it and want to buy some it's worth it i definitely recommend getting some but yeah let me know what you guys's thoughts our comments are on like whether you believe the puffco peak is more your thing or the card of magnus you're the cardo mega the carter the focus card uh just got me high already talking about history and [ __ ] [ __ ] uh yeah let me know if the focus card or the puffco peaker you know would you prefer song again like comment subscribe and we out", "EZpaeK2-VBo": "to it right today we got wedding cake diamonds from tanks are another 502 company I think I did reveal

hear [ __ ] me my bad i knocked you guys over that's what i like to hear my farmers say because if they're going for yield they know the quality is not good but if they know the quality is good they don't want you to go for yield keep the quality good oh my god yes sir that was like smoking on some of my own homegrown gave me the dab sweats it was smooth the entire time it cleans up extremely

fast [Music] [ __ ] hambone [ __ ] ham bone good [ __ ] dude good [ __ ] [ __ ] hats off my hat's off i don't give a lot of props to a lot of people because a lot of people don't [ __ ] grow really really high quality [ __ ] like this i'll take it all day long brother you know something that's not often talked about is the uh the relationship how you have to grow with your farmer or hasher whichever way you're going you have to grow and collaborate together to improve the end product 25 and 160 mix micron test press dab let me add this real quick before i forget last time i forgot to [ __ ] do it um pull up my [ __ ] chat here god damn it oh my god that dab has my head spinning right now like i just down the [ __ ] bottle of patron all right yeah man that's that's that's no [ __ ] i don't give a lot of praise to a lot of people so ham bones my dude you crushed it and i got nothing but good [ __ ] to say for i can't wait to see what you do once i put a 20 kino in your head [Music] brick by brick by brick by brick by mother [ __ ] brick we are about to build this hatch house so something in my gut now is telling me to go up to my 202. something in my [ __ ] gut what is it what is it what is it it's in my gut it's in my [ __ ] nope it's deeper than my gut it's my nuts it's my [ __ ] balls my balls just spoke to me and they said why are you going to do something different than what you normally do don't change [Music] [ __ ] i don't know balls my brain is contesting you i just saw some [ __ ] on the press with the 25 and the 160 at 175 that was leaking but it wasn't a whole lot of it to leak so it couldn't really you know but then again am i just making excuses dilemma what say ye the people so i know i watched pedro's press this morning actually it was van ness how much pedro and i have very different styles of pressing but we both get very very good results at the end and i think that's a very good example of how different paths can lead to the same house you know um and ultimately because we both are experienced hashers both he and i know how to end up working the material after the press to where we can make it look the same you know in the end anyways you know the post-press manipulation is just really stupid these days with what you could do okay there's this next to the largest one we're gonna do it now a small one and this is the one we might test for 180. but i don't know i feel like we're entering the doodoo zone those of you that watch my stream know about the duder zone at 180 uh really 180 or 200 it's kind of like doodle [Music] dude hmm all right [ __ ] it let's let's test it on this small one that's what the tester is for right if this tester doesn't [ __ ] bleed beautiful [ __ ] terps i'm turning up the tab mister [Music] the [ __ ] go is in the house bro we've been bumping your music hard you've been busy making music [Music] he was live on instagram this morning too [Music] [Music] so oh my [ __ ] oh i just got that [ __ ] my balls just tug doggy from the inside you're like don't do it it's not hot enough it's not going to bleed fast enough don't do it [Music] so [Music] so [Music] what's up elite welcome to the grow room gang homie i appreciate the support nah [Music] so so [Music] so [Music] by the way if anybody's curious my directional flow fold is the easiest most least complicated easiest to collect off of method that i found i watched all those [ __ ] videos on youtube and these [ __ ] origami guys doing all this stupid [ __ ] not real origami but i mean all these rosin press dudes that are just doing the [ __ ] most and i feel like man one piece of parchment right you fold it twice on the ends so that way you can pinch that fold in and it doesn't leak out right you fold these sides good put a good crease in them okay don't fold the back too hard don't put it too big of a crease in it you might get a blow out if you the bigger the crease the bigger the chance for blowout all right then for me i know i need to cut off a little bit right to get it to flow into the jar where i want it and then fold it in half like you're making a [ __ ] paper paper airplane all right you guys remember this old school [ __ ] paper airplane [ __ ] from no time but you're not making the regular slow glider you're making that [ __ ] that fast one so you want to do the the um right that's what you're basically doing you're making that oh that paper plane right now when you open that up you get these beautiful folds where everything leads straight to the middle okay and you open it up what can i say except you're welcome for the tech that i share on this channel there you go now when it flows it's just you open it up you collect off one sheet you don't have like three different pieces of parchment to collect off of i mean come on kind of [ __ ] that's not good tech man you gotta [ __ ] collect it off of like three different pieces of parchment just so you can make it look cool i don't like that [Music] oh no too much what happened let me lose please talk to me seamless can you talk to me calm down you guys it happens it happens you know how many times i've accidentally muted somebody or put somebody on timeout all you have to do is accidentally rub something across your screen for like two seconds of the charging wire your hand if it's in your pocket whatever and you can like literally ban half the [ __ ] chat it's ridiculous i've done it like three times to people ocean's account was banned for like a month they didn't even use that account anymore it didn't even use it he was like [ __ ] it i'm getting on a different account [Music] so crazy that is craziness all right y'all remember the tech all right paper plane tech don't fold it straight to the the halfway point where the the fold is because then you might jam your rosin flow up a little bit especially if you keep it closed like this i don't like keeping it closed like this then the rosin gets everywhere it's more messy right that's why i make these folds [Music] my boy came straight back to the car what is up you couldn't resist it my tummy hurts i gotta go doo-doo but i'm too embarrassed to go at work on the public toilet i go home i need to [ __ ] on my own toilet i have a medical condition you don't want me to sit on your toilet it might spread the doctor said i can't share toilets with people it's a medical condition i'm not allowed to talk about it [Music] all right 180 one shot at one eight with a small bag we got 33 left on the battery so now i'm gonna set up the tripod and get you guys plugged in and in a good spot sorry my terps are running in that last dab that [ __ ] really [ __ ] sent me to the moon for a minute [Music] i can't even [ __ ] can't in front can't even front i straight blasted me to the moon and back [Music] now i'm just trying to get a cool spot for you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] good all right good fresh gloves um all right [Music] so [Music] [Music] um so i've got to figure out where i can get you that you're not going to be in the way because [Music] what i'm doing is more important than what you're seeing so i'm not going to be dead but you know this is what it is players all right first press test press 180 fahrenheit wedding crashers full spectrum hashtags and this is the smaller of the presses first can be a test see how it responds after temperature [Music] so [Music] i'm not even using any pressure i'm just letting that the hydraulics go down and towing basically right now [Music] so [Music] oh oh [Music] um uh h [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] um [Music] is foreign [Music] this is at a 180 right now oh it's just get all the terps out baby is [Music] happy mess is [ __ ] beautiful let's go [Music] [Music] um okay so let's keep it at 180 i feel like even a 1800 six all right let's see how it flows again at 180. whoa is that a bottle of tomatillo so you can stop carrying around your bottle and head to am pm instead right now buy any hot dog and get a second for a buck only at 8 00 pm too much good stuff buy one at regular price get a second of equal or lesser value for one dollar selection may vary by site while supplies last fire i got it pretty damn dry too all right well i feel like that's all we're gonna get out of those we might be able to push a tiny bit more yield out at the higher temps but uh that's why i raised it two degrees to try and keep the flow a little bit higher um beard hairspray did i put something in there uh there's nothing where do you see beard hair is that bro what are you talking about [Music] [Music] show me [Music] [Music] hmm so [Music] so sorry guys i'm bumping you around i gotta get the bag [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] who's your daddy [Music] wow [Music] um uh [Music] quality over yield keep it as low pressure as you can slam in my throat from allergies keep it as low pressure as you can and uh get as most like the most out of it that you can i get 95 of it like at the lowest pressure you possibly can and then ramp it up towards the end and get everything else out like i'm just barely hitting one ton right now [Music] [Music] uh [ __ ] this flow made my balls drop i've never seen anything squirt like this before oh squeak now [Music] well at least on his like sound stream or sound files why you got to play spanish as just because his name's hotto what the [ __ ] what's up roots just barely hitting two tons now is division anger is near the higher pressures [Music] [Music] i cannot breathe okay now we're three and a half almost four tons low pressure low temperature low and slow remember you guys talk about this low and slow or hot and fast no do do zone she passing the doo doo zone you get dookie every strain has its own doodoo zone but a good starting zone is typically between like 180 185 you start hitting that doo-doo zone and then you come out of it around 195 200 usually increasing pressure up to 5. people want to know what psi that is i'm sure five tons on this press right well one one ton is 2000 psi this bag is a two and a half inch by four inch bag it's probably only three inches though um it was actually it's about four inches i can see right here so it's four by two and a half all right so here's that ten so if i'm at five that's ten thousand divided by ten so i'm at a thousand psi going up six times we're gonna cruise it on up to seven eight watch the flow see if it increases at all if not then we'll pull it bacon vape is giving you guys the [ __ ] honey terps straight from the flowers and nipples secreting the nectar straight to the bee that's me i process it for you turn it into the honey here you go [Music] going up to 10 tons 2 000 psi just give me the tips just give me the tips and i'll start the show i could take another dab of three more eleven thousand at 11 tons now 12. i think it's safe to say we've gotten everything out of there let's call it delicioso now if the yield is not what i'm expecting off of this [ __ ] we're going up in temperature i don't give a [ __ ] [ __ ] how good this looks but we gotta test it i think because and we'll see what the bag starts with the back i feel a lot of weight on the parchment which is not a bad thing i don't care as long as i got out of the bag it's all about how this bag feels right nope it's all it's all gone there's nothing that is full extraction mode right there let's go [Music] [Music] well 182 is all right [Music] and i feel like i want more you must know expect 20 yield or less what you're talking about [Music] [Music] one remember you have to evaluate each and every strain they're going to react differently right now whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa i feel like 182 is good but i feel like i'm gonna give it two more degrees go up to 184 okay just because i want it to hold a little bit more flow [Music] for flour it's about freshness you guys you guys flour flour flour you guys wanna talk about flour rosin i'll teach you guys some flour rosin who wants show of hands class class who wants some flower rosin tech while we watch the flows [Music] so nice stoney hell yeah okay okay calm down calm down no no spamming no spamming let's sit in the [ __ ] hallway kid you're on timeout um all right here's the thing you guys the trick with flower rosin is this i'm going to tell you and this is i always have a lot of unpopular opinions but i always have flame product so take it for what it's worth if you have to process flour the trick is my quick dry method okay making sure that it is fully bone crispy no fresh green fresh hay smell whatsoever okay pack it into bags as soon as it's done don't put it in turkey bags and burp it and blah blah blah blah i mean dry it on the branch until it is bone dry almost too dry you're not smoking it okay and despite what a lot of hashers like to perpetuate without actually having tested themselves okay humidity when you're pressing quality material does not [ __ ] help okay it does jack diddley ball sack squat for you i will tell any hasher i don't care how popular he is or how good his product looks i'll tell him to his face that's [ __ ] okay what matters is how fresh the buds are okay if you get it properly dried and you pack it into bags really fresh i mean like that night the next night right and you press it either really low and slow or kind of on the hotter end to 10 to 20 and fast okay and i guarantee you your yield is gonna be [ __ ] amazing humidity has jack diddly ball sack to do with it because i press my nugs as dry as possible i purposely avoid getting them too humid okay so it's about how fresh the butt is how well it was grown and then you process it at the proper temperature so that it doesn't sit there on the plates for too long and you will end up a really high quality product i kid you not i've tested it for myself all the different types of boveda packs curing it blah blah blah none of that matters what matters is that you press it you press it as soon as [ __ ] possible off the plants as soon as it's properly dried you know that's the key that's the key i've had hash rosin or i mean flower rosin look better than some people with hash rosin because of that that's all you gotta do [ __ ] humidity packs [ __ ] all the [ __ ] press it fresh it only matters if you if you're storing it and you need to keep the humidity proper cool you're not storing it you're pressing it within 48 hours minimum i mean maximum i press mine within like the first 24 hours if i'm gonna be pressing flour but i mean what do i know what do i know we're not even at a ton yet this shit's on fresh frozen this is not fresh frozen either this is dry this is sbnb quick dry method this is what i talk about collaboration with your farmers i taught him the tech so that he could bring me high quality material that was prepared the correct way and voila we have a winning combination that's how you collaborate with your farmer to make each other better man people don't understand flower rosin can be really really really clean and good and almost as good as hash rosin the only difference is you know the flower is going to give you a more in-depth complete entourage effect and the hash rosin's going to be a little bit lacking in that department but it's going to be a more pure taste a more pure concentration of flavor on just the purity side of things no not even a three week dry holy mole i'll do a video on my quick dry tech i know a lot of people want to know about it but i'll make a video i think i'm on top chat am i trolling i'm on top chat [Music] [Music] so thank you [Music] [Music] low and slow and high and fast don't always have the same yield it just depends on how good you are and if you can maneuver the material well enough if you find the appropriate temperatures for the low and slow then yeah you can really get a good yield out of it you know and really extract everything out of it but just by by nature and science you're going to get a slightly higher yield using a higher temperature because there's only so much that you can make up for by applying additional pressure the rest of it has to come from heat those are the only two factors at play here well if time heat um and pressure right so you have to find the the proper zone for the low and slow the proper zone for the hot and fast so that you maintain yield air quality on equal planes up to six and it's like what have you done increase the pressure up to about 10 tons here start getting everything else out of [Music] that [Music] earth wind and fire get her get her get her get her get down 12. 12 and a half calling it five four three two you know nasty mcnasty september to fill out 30th is don't forget to respond and make sure to count all kids living with you most of the year even if they aren't family members when babies and children are counted the programs that support them and their families get more of the federal fund you may need for the next 10 years is that the full extraction there's definitely nothing left in there [Music] uh i don't know full extractions i don't know yeah winston yes sir doing everything i can to extract the most out of her and uh see if i can't help him get a good indication of you know its potential there's no better way to find out the potential of a strain in my opinion than washing it and pressing it um in my opinion that gives you the ultimate ultimate experience of how good it can be really what's the yield what's the terps what's the [ __ ] you know what's it look like is it mostly terps is it is it a high thc content as well is it a good ratio i mean you can really understand a lot of that just by looking at it come off the plates by looking at it and feeling it as it comes out of the freeze dryer i mean there's just so much information there if you know what to look for as a hasher you know yeah that flower was [ __ ] on the money no doubt [Music] [Music] [Music] so oh no you lost a leg hold on get back on there that's fine we gotta give you there give me the sugar give me that [ __ ] baby looking [ __ ] fine as hell in there come here go find us over here give me some sugar baby very good from the time dude look at that [ __ ] flow [Music] so so i'm going to slightly disengage this press that's fine that's just the handle i'm going to go up and move my ram over just a touch because it's slightly off center there we go and then we'll keep the press going not advisable to do if you're not an experienced presser is [ __ ] restarting your press mid press don't do that a lot can go wrong but if you see something's wrong and you have the ability to fix it fix it don't settle for less that would have resulted in a less than optimal yield the bag may have potentially blown out something that needed to be corrected and corrected back on back on track man it comes to flow again yes look at that flow though back to our regularly tuned program go go hashing waterfalls ah no high pressure doesn't cause blowouts improper packing of the bag and increasing pressure too fast causes blowouts i press my flower up to about 16 to 17 tons on this press and my hash up to about 12 and i stop around 12 usually um laughs hey morty you're back okay i'll pull up the girls one monkey down and monkey number two what's up we're gonna be asleep uh nope she's not asleep but what and her cameras move but she's not standing up she's laying down so i'll give her a minute increasing pressure up seven times um angie it's time to take a nap lay down please oh good girl thank you increasing pressure up to 12 tons there's some good stuff in there still this one went up to 13 tons on this one give the good old countdown one two we're counting up because i'm high three four five we're done yes very sexy oh my god oh oh oh oh gosh goodness damn bone make a good team keep this up this is beautiful but what that yield do beautiful extraction full extraction is a good one the terp fiends will be happy your terps will get you high a little sneak peek got a little sneaky peeky oh yeah check some work [ __ ] real quick i usually don't have any meetings on mondays but i got to just double check that we're good angelica lay down it's time to take a nap please darn kids um ugh drippity drip drip drip we're literally at one ton right now just barely at one time don't believe me look so so we're up to three tons now i got really [ __ ] spaced for a second um [Music] [Music] oh [Music] let's go up to five times i think we got just about everything at that low uh pressure we're gonna get five times now give me my terps my need mass [Music] don't eat straight rosin i've talked about it before it's not good it's a it's a really concentrated essential oils if you get really good terpene content in there and it can burn you pretty good you can get chemical burn i put decarb rosin in my uh you know mouth and i tried a little straight glob off the press underneath the tongue doesn't feel good going up to uh seven eight oh i'm gooey mortgage making the right

let's see what she's doing here baby what are you doing do you need a diaper change guy come let me go check on my little baby real quick even though cover all this up real quick [Music] [Music] [Music] i just wanna take my time losing my [Music] just mind find [Music] peace of mind [Music] i just wanna [Music] [Music] at the same time [Music] i [Music] um [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

is that 184 uh [Music] the key to being a successful hasher is knowing what to look for when you're pressing and washing and knowing how to take those those signs into consideration and change certain aspects of what you might be doing at that time pressure temperature how long you're washing how rough you're washing how long you dry it for etc etcetera etcetera there's so many things that come into a play even before you pull it down off the plant so tuning in to the daily dabs we do this daily not pressing every day but we're depressing washing doing some grow room [ __ ] dabbing and

time so you call that heart [Music] [Music] hmm that's how you do that and then go back through you give it the old finger banger ring fresh gloves squeeze fresh gloves if your glove starts sticking it's time to swap gloves but you can pull that finger really tight and then hold it there and i gotta get the rest of it off real easy damn cool we use the dab tool for the rest of it ready might as well hit it while it's ready it's nice and warm [ __ ] it let's get it [Music] so [Music] [Music] so now i'm going to swap up to use this end it's longer i can get further down so [Music] don't use no [ __ ] drills you guys jesus i've seen people using drills with the dab tool attachment stop knock that [ __ ] off put some [ __ ] elbow grease put some pride into your work and stop risking putting metal shavings into your rosin just please stop it i don't know who in here needs to hear that but stop it it's really worth it well i'm not gonna get it perfect right now i used a day or two at least push that down [Music] [Music] okay now we're going to take the rest no give me my glove back ah give me my glue back [Music] apparently that finger is too warm got most of it down now here's the trick we'll pop it nice and tight i'm going to turn my plates down to where's that 84 i'm just going to put it on 84 right now i don't feel like adjusting the singles but normally i'd go to like 80 but uh 84 is fine and then uh what we do then is once i see the plates um drop below like 150 i'll go ahead and put this whole jar on top of the plates and it'll allow everything in here to come down to the bottom and combine together so i hope that helped some of you guys show you my process you know what i'm saying rosin on my arm i know it was just a tiny little speck of that thca flaky [ __ ] i grabbed it excuse me no no no real like jar tech really it's just enough to um get it to settle down you know that's why i lower the temp and i wait to put it on the plates and then uh what else fire right here fire fire fire set this aside dab time yep this is a special dab it's a fresh dab with a full speck [Music] don't forget to give your damascus the weekly wipe down with uh with vegetable oil otherwise it will not hold its shine it will start to lose its uh shine luster finish oh [ __ ] balls [Music] quench it [Music] yo i'm gonna start keeping my damascus in a quench filled with [ __ ] iso fresh iso better holy [ __ ] now for the tradition around here for those of you that are new it is time in the stream uh the only way we can in the stream is to clean the spoon what's cleaning the spoon you know when you're done mixing up cookie dough your kid probably not nowadays i don't know if you still do it as an adult but you take the spoon what's left of it or the bowl and you scrape it up then you eat it right i don't know if anybody else ever did that but we're going to clean the spoon holy [ __ ] [ __ ] dab a row that's gonna be a big one i have cleaned the spoon would you agree that the spoon has been cleaned the spoon has been cleaned oh i'm not ready i'm not ready that is a one to two gram dab i guarantee it can we weigh this for confirmation yes we can i would really like to know [Music] i honestly feel like this will be a waste if i take a whole gram dab of this okay let's see what we got now okay tear that little piece of parchment [Music] out [Music] one point one i'm not going to be a jackass and waste this high high quality rosin i don't need a full [ __ ] granddad right now but i will take a half of that there is point six on here now so all of this going straight into the bang here not going to waste super high quality material like this i mean come on look at this so this one's just for the youtube because i'm gonna die i feel like i'm gonna need to sit down but you guys are on the chair so never mind [ __ ] it i'm gonna try and bring you guys a little closer and almost [ __ ] up the only big spicy chicken nope why isn't everything about going on a big dab they want to play a [ __ ] advertisement no no no has just the right amount of spice it's not hot magma in your mouth spicy but it gives you a little kick in the pants not a bad kick in the pants a perfectly spicy savory tasting kick in the pants from am pm get two big spicy chicken sandwiches for just four bucks am pm too much good stuff two for four dollars or one at regular price for 249 at participating locations for a limited time or while supplies last [Music] you haven't even used the shovel here um cheers everybody thanks for hanging out i hope you enjoyed the stream keep out you guys me [Music] oh [Music] how many yeah instant purse the windows in it [Music] sweet turkey cakey [Music] take your breath away [Music] makes your nose runny [Music] makes your nose runny [Music] who wants to guess who wants to get [Music] wow wow look [Music] reclaim baby [Music] uh [Music] what [Music] [Applause] wow i got damaged [Music] [Music] never really mentioned myself these jars 180 grams if we take one or two grams [Music] that's 76 yield right now [Music] did 116 grams roughly that's it cheers hopefully that helps there's the tech there's the tech and wait for this y'all don't even know", "o6UrX9n_UWo": "[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys it's cliff with peer pressure here thanks for tuning in to are solving this review series we've got Roz and Ryan from olio here today we're gonna be checking out his papaya punch number four let's get to it [Music] the papaya punch number four from olio is a cross between purple punch and papaya both heavily indica dominant strains the purple punch was giving me hints of grape candy and a sweet blueberry muffin fresh out of the oven while the papaya was was on the sweet candy side of things papaya candy maybe a little hint of mango in there and it's very surprising that it was an indica dominant strain because most of the effects I was getting were what you would attribute to a sativa dominant strain and I was getting a very energetic productive and uplifting high I tribute this to the high concentration of limonene found in the string and the limonene is really what was giving me that mood elevation in euphoria the second most concentrated terpene present and this strain was Lin Ahlul and I tribute that to the relaxation and stress relief that I was getting from this hey guys it's clip peer-pressure here welcome to the solvent ice review series this is episode number two we've got rosin ryan here with olio and we're gonna be reviewing the papaya punch number four this is our jam product this is been heat cured this is pretty much the most separated of all our consistencies as far as THC a and terpene content within the rosin and we believe it's probably the most shelf-stable even if you don't put it in the fridge or anything like that it keeps flavor for a long time and it's honestly my favorite consistency that I'm smoking right now so you can leave this out and it doesn't it doesn't you know decrease in terpene value it won't dry up which some people do like but this here let me show you here sure so what's this little dab tool here so every gram of ours has kind of comes with a personal dabber it's just a little extra thing we do just select emergency dabber in case of situations for sure very nice nice touch so what can you tell me about the the strain here so this is our papaya punch number four this is we have a few different fee knows we always Fino test a few different seeds that we get it's like the most exotic fruity and most punchy almost phyno it's got an exotic note it's um it's got a little bit of that artificial grape in it from the purple punch it's probably one of my favorite strains at the moment and this is from pony seeds papaya times purple punch very nice yep this is perfect for during the day I'll run some errands after dabbing some of this stuff it's very relaxing but its clear-headed yes it's a hybrid like most things are nowadays and for me personally I know it's different for everybody but I could dab some of this and still get a lot of stuff done during the day I don't feel too body locked or anything like that I still I'm ready to go you know do my stuff for the day so got that clarity stay exactly exactly and it's so flavorful that I almost don't expect to relax feeling I'm expecting some type of anxiety yes achieve a high but it's honestly perfect mellow high for the middle of the day definitely so how do you typically go about finding a good hash string it is many different steps so first of all to grow which ones grow nice we can't get any males obviously we take out the males whatever females are left it really is dependent on how well they grow their yield in the garden then once we wash them it's gonna be based on water hash yields it's gonna be the thing that plays the most role and if we keep it or not if it does yield well a nice hash and it presses well usually we'll keep it it all depends on flavors yields we all come together smoked them we all you know put in our opinions of you know which one do you think is a little bit tastier versus if the yield if it's really worth it sometimes we'll take a tastier one even if it yields a little bit lower just because it's got that little extra that we know people will will enjoy it so for sure so what do you thoughts on fresh frozen verse washing dried and cured flour so you can wash cured I've seen it done stuff 99% of our stuff is fresh frozen almost almost all we have our own in-house garden everything is harvested fresh frozen washed within usually one to two weeks so we try to wash it as quickly as possible really keeps that terpene profile just like it was when you were smelling the plant so when you're going around you got your fingers on the nose I want that to be what the rosin tastes like yeah I went down I really do think fresh frozen you know produces that a little bit better of a quality in the end for sure yeah so yeah you talked about doing BHO extraction in the past and you know when BHO first came out people were always looking for a light golden color but it seems now that things are kind of moving more towards an almost white color and I've even heard of people pulling their plants early to even get that color do you have any comment on like that is a huge trend right now in the in the grow world as people know you can pull your plants a little bit early but you're gonna sacrifice what I believe is a little bit taste and your potency the effects from you pulling early I believe are gonna be felt people really go for that visual yeah so when people see white hash they really they get excited yeah I think people really need to try the hash more side-by-sides sometimes a darker hash will blow the lighter hash out of the water with taste with potency affect how it makes you feel so I really think people should try stuff before you know everybody eats with their eyes so to speak but but uh you really gotta get smoking yeah so what can you tell us about the terpene profiles some of the flavors that you're getting up the papaya punch number four so this number four is probably our most like exotic fruity vino of this papaya punch it's mostly papaya notes it's that exotic fruit in there and it's got a little bit of artificial grape in there from that purple punch that's definitely that's it in there I think it's probably the most well balanced of our papaya punch he knows as far as flavor goes and that consistency is honestly my favorite I like when I see large chunks and they're swimming in Terps so definitely that Jam was just it's something else that is beautiful I seriously could smell it earlier just sitting back here when it was sitting over there so I liked what you did with it for sure well what about terpenes in general their medicinal benefits I mean how do you think that plays a role into the medicinal benefits the high and whether you classify it as an indica sativa I think everybody you know takes terpenes in a little bit differently obviously some of the ones like limonene stuff like that are just known to generally give people a little bit more uplifting effects like that but as far as terpenes go it's really about finding a flavor that you enjoy in an effect that doesn't hinder your day really yeah if you smoked something that you really like but it's giving you anxiety obviously that might not be the strain for you you should find something you know with similar profiles that don't actually have that same terpene you know within the plant so if you like something fruity but you're getting horrible anxiety from lemon let's maybe try like a citrus yeah or another a strawberry banana or something like that where you know hey this tastes really good but it's not gonna cause me to freak out yeah strawberry banana is one of my favorites - it's super relaxing probably the heaviest indica of the fruity stuff that I've tried so I know a lot of people that love it definitely definitely so one thing I love about following you on instagram is that you're just always dropping knowledge helping push the community further for those of you who aren't following him on Instagram he's at a troz and Ryan check him out lots of great content out there so I feel like the first time I ever heard the term rosin jam it was from following you on Instagram can you comment did did you coin that phrase is there anything there it was kind of more of the people speaking we did a little survey and stuff we just wanted a different our selves a little bit um there was a huge craze going on at the time of people putting rosin in jars and this whole new tech that's going on and I really wanted to create a name that people think Jam they think olio but honestly it's kind of taken off we've noticed other people you know using the rosin Jam name and we really don't seem to mind we've had people in Spain posting rosin jam so I think there's a really awesome to see and it's just it's just our version of rosin sauce or you know just a just a new just a new consistency we're just trying to cone so definitely yeah consistency is everything when I'm looking for a product if typically I lean more towards the jams you know if I see something that's a little more buttery that's just not usually my flavor lots of people like the butter does it is all of reference a lot of people love the butter just for ease of dabbing people like to just dig in some people grab it with their hands and just drop a bomb right in there and just its ease of dabbing it's a preference some people don't want the rosin heat it up some people want it straight off the press and put in the fridge so we like to offer a product for everybody yeah if you want your Ross and put in the fridge we have classic coins um if you want butter we have butter if you want your stuff lightly heated we have a batter and if you want a true separation and you want your rasam to look like BHO a live resin consistency and you don't want to leave it in the fridge then the jam is for you no down so I've got a bunch of homies they nerd out on temperatures as far as pressing goes dabbing goes do you have like a perfect temperature range usually fall in when it comes to pressing and dabbing yes I do if you know if something is pretty melty I use usually stick around 180 degrees that's a nice low temp of times and stuff really vary between how much you put in the bag and what you're squishing and all that but I like 180 degrees it just really is like a nice golden you know point for me for sure yeah so what about the your actual rig or the nail have you ever played around with temperatures I have and stuff it's been a while I'm usually just a time kind of guy kind of figure out what my new nail you know Davin is I'll heat it up and kind of do a test or at 45 seconds you know on minute 30 kind of see what my nails I like a low time dab it uh I'm gonna be dabbing I like a little bit extra on the bottom I'll leave a little puddle sometimes I don't mind you're sure we'll be sure to keep it on the blue setting oh yeah yeah so when you typically take a dab how long does it take for you to feel the effects usually I'm and this is just me I usually feel the effects pretty instantly honestly me too I uh I'll take a dab of this stuff and be ready to go yeah you know it's it's pretty instant behind the eyes yeah yep do you get that with other extracts or do you think rosin high gloss hooker I think rosin in general and solvent listen general I feel throughout my body a little bit more I noticed when I dabbed BHO it's it's more of a head high uhm BHO always you know it feels a little more floaty to me uh rosin solvent list is always a little bit more body I feel a little bit more relaxation from it instantly definite so tell me a little bit about the the bubble hash side of things how are you guys washing what's the trick to getting this so it all starts in the grow so most of our stuff is it's very well taken care of throughout all of its life the veg has to be very clean the early flowering stages at the environment is a huge factor so that's all before the wash is really the plant when we take when we're harvesting no no trimmers even touch the nose they're all hold it you know by the stem cut off the nose and take little golf ball sized pieces really trying to not disrupt any trike formation that we've you know work so hard to grow so washing we use our all RO water it's all hand washed pretty much as gentle as you can wash bud they do it multiple times will wash four or five times just to ensure that all the heads are taken off it's done in a cold room it's all ROI sorrow water it's as clean as can be in there so yeah that's how you make clean Rossum's clean hash and a clean girl so you mentioned washing by hand why do you prefer that over say and automate it where I can just hit the button and it's just uh really control over you know your whole process you can stir as gently as you want you can have a machine that stirs pretty gently but just having that control that hand on it and really seeing how much you're taking off each plant and stuff like that it's that extra care that really goes into it that really just makes it that much better for sure well let's let's get to it yes you want to about here guess we'll switch on over to the blue temp there it's the lowest temperature we've got I've got a little new little guide tool too they do come in handy [Music] man that's just what I was looking for you can definitely get that sweep of pile on the front and then on the backend you've got that like earthy grape soda candy like it was it's definitely what I'm looking for I'm glad you enjoyed it man yeah I always um I always enjoy papaya but that uh that little extra little grape really adds something to it it's got like a little almost a spiciness almost to it it's just really good for sure so what are you feeling like effects wise right now what do you think I I love the relaxed feeling I get from this the clear-headedness good vibe to some music right now to there so I just love the effects just great for chilling yeah you know I've got a real calm my body's real relaxed but in my brain I've got that little tingle to it but it's still real clear yep perfect biking it's quick behind the eyes and stuff quick acting I still feel like I could you know get up and go do some stuff right now so it's perfect and it is some strong stuff dum papaya punch generally tests around 80% for us so I mean that's a pretty high THC content so sure yep the rest of it's pretty much chirps we've been getting regularly 20% turps with the jam it's probably a 5 to 8 percent increase over just having it out you know just fresh press so wow it's quite a significant difference yeah so if somebody was looking to get some of this sweet papaya grape soda candy where could they find that so yeah you can find our product pretty much all over Colorado it's in recreational and medical shops dispensaries we have a flagship dispo it's higher grade they offer recreational and medical at two different locations you're probably gonna have our your best bet you know finding some jam there but we also you know post drops all over our Instagram page at dabble leo 7:10 you can give us a follow I also have my personal page at Ross and Ryan so I usually post the flavors as soon as I make them people get a little anxious and always ask me where it's at it's gonna be about a week or two before testing and all the packaging gets ready usually about a week and usually the olio page is where you can find all the information the drops what you know pretty much where everything's going that you're looking for thanks for stopping by man really enjoy the papaya punch number four it's definitely gonna be one of my goat cheese for this summer for anybody out there is not following them on Instagram be sure to check out at Roz and Ryan always dropping knowledge about solving this extraction trying to push the industry forward and dab olio 710 that's where we got the papaya punch number four from highly recommend it I really appreciate you guys having me I always love talking hash and thanks again so much come down so after sitting on the high for a while you know I really found it interesting that I was getting a lot of sativa dominant effects or what you would think would be sativa dominant effects because they're both in economists trains that we're working with here you know we've got the papaya on one side we've got the purple punch on the other like I said both indica dominant so you would expect a sedative effect but what I found was something really uplifting and that's why I think it's the perfect Brosnan for summertime vacation because it was relaxing mentally but still energetic got a little euphoria from that so an all-around great summertime high and perfect for like I said any vacation any trip to the beach or the lake definitely be my go-to and thanks for tuning in guys be sure to

got in my brand new trp stack my uh trip stack triple stack here from triminator i wanted to show it off how beautiful it is this is my ambassador version so i just got it in they were nice enough to ship that out david came out here to be able to unpackage it with me take a check look and i am getting ready to do a nice big squish on it so i'm gonna really break her in and have a uh see how well it does on i don't know squishy here so we're live we we're doing good here all right so let me get this set up exactly how i want to go i'm going to do four bags of 15 grams three bags on the bottom plate all right so i'm getting this set up here basically i'm using this so that we can get a good look at the flow coming out let's give this a little pressure here [Music] and i have two more 15 gram bags we're gonna do on the top level this is what i love about this press not all the time do i get a lot of product that i can push through but when i have multiple runs on the same product it really is nice to be able to get it through here all right that should look just about right just want to make sure these are in there good i don't want to have any problems okay now the fun begins okay paper set up like i want all about the prep work make sure you got everything placed right where you want it looking good all right got each one of these bags here with a directional flow so that's basically going to push everything out the front here on the front i've got these bags that are made just a little bit longer which will give them room to drip over what i love about this press is it gives me the ability to change the direction so i can tilt this at any angle i want to be able to get that rosin to flow off those plates a little bit faster when i'm doing a lot you know i can what i'm doing over i can just turn it all the way 90 degrees have it run straight out but this makes it a little bit easier for collecting and i feel like getting air mixed in with it is is kind of a little down from what i'm opposite what i'm trying to do actually so here we go start taking a look here oh that's so pretty but i like it still one bag that's still kind of everything's looking good though they're all holding pressure's just about right there we go that there is beautiful girl scout cookies ice water hash fresh frozen whole plant a few more farms here in tulsa grit beautiful that that looks a lot better than i thought it was going to that uh it's gorgeous i'm pressing that 180 on this i've been kind of changing all over the place on temperatures uh i'd like i like getting it off the plates as quick as possible you know i just don't want to have any reason for it to sit on there any longer going slower temperature wise lower temperature wise and i found this really is the best trade-offs on all sides because you're always going to give up something for something else speed temperature that's artwork right there we just need to put that up on the wall talk about expensive artwork bringing it up probably close to about three three thousand right now two thousand tons of psi i feel the bags are pretty much have given me all about all of it just want to make sure with having this many bags on there you kind of go the extra mile because some are just a little different definitely don't want to leave any i have to get this weight up see how many grams we really got off of here so the biggest thing about this is that i'm an ambassador now for triminator here in oklahoma so if you want to check out this press if you have one of these presses anything interested in it give me a call hit me up on instagram 9180g underscore and i'll be glad more than happy to show you answer any questions kind of just give you an idea in education we're going to be doing educational videos with terminator doing on the rosin education series and we'll have some really good information on there people just you know trying to get basic information not too overwhelming but also have some really good details for people that already know what they're doing just little tricks of the trade all right i really feel like that's about all i can get out of her fighting back on all the bags okay sorry i'm kind of concentrating on getting these out of here without making any mistakes and i didn't i don't know if the lighting in here will do it justice oh you can see all those terps in there beautiful the smell let's take a look at one of these bags on the bottom row that'd be the one with the least amount of power let's see how she looks so all you want to do one one good indicator of how well you did is to take a look at the bag through the light and how clear it is gives you a really good idea that you've got all of the product out of there you can see just pushed it out to the edges and that's going to be all your other material that you didn't want out of there anyways so very pleased let's look at that let's look at one on the top shelf and just see how they did comparatively all right taking a look at the same thing very similar they look pretty much identical this one has a little bit bigger that looks really good that's one thing about this product is just the hand pump everything about it being able to really feel the uh the pressure that i'm getting back and where i am in that bag so bva throw it out to them like great pump and the primary man you just can't beat it so let me know you guys want to check them out again i'm the ambassador here in oklahoma and um looking forward to putting out a lot of good uh educational

here both instagram my main instagram and my personal instagram follow my snapchat and my twitter as well right there now back to the [ __ ] video what's going on everybody we're back with more 710 and this time [ __ ] i am so juiced i'm [ __ ] like i'm geeked i'm ready because first time ever tier one water hash from 710 tier [ __ ] one first i just gotta say that i've only ever seen tier one on their photos and it just looks like hashi grains of sand and it just looks so nice and tasty bro and it is absolutely beautiful and smells just like the strength and we have let me just show you we got the unquestionably og crossed with the wedding cake and if you guys have ever tried the 710 wedding cake it is some gas i've actually tried the percy rosin of it and it is [ __ ] amazing now let me tell you guys this is something else like i swear this is something else i am so i'm pumped because i've never had as you guys can see right there tier one we've only ever had like one or two tier one items ever which was full spectrum hash i mean of course percy also counts because i believe percy's are tier one and two only but that i know of this is the second or third tier one item we have and i'm just ready for this [ __ ] i hope you guys are ready to pizza [ __ ] if you guys ever see some tier one water hash get that [ __ ] especially from this company surprised it came in in a white container because normally you know black box black container but i prefer the white ones now are y'all ready questionable yogi tier one and there it is oh my god see what i mean by it looks like hashy grains of sand but just look at how beautiful it looks like sand crystals bro look at this you see that look at that where do you see waterhouse of this quality are level nowhere but 7 10. [ __ ] i [ __ ] love 710 and quite frankly i've had water hatch from other companies but none do it like this like none can satisfy you like when you take a dab of something like this like first of all i smell nothing but og i do smell a slight like other scent you know that being the wedding cake but this is unquestionably some emoji just like the [ __ ] name of the of the [ __ ] strain says i kid you not i kid you not that this [ __ ] is smelly like look at it bro this is some gas all right y'all that's what i'm taking cheers wow i gotta say wow definitely the og overpower this one unbelievable wow i'm so high that was such a beautiful i love hash that was that [ __ ] was unbelievable oh my god i'm not going to tell you that i'm i'm spacing out i'm [ __ ] loaded hey this is nice like okay so if you guys have been sticking in lately and you saw the last video that i did which was i believe the last one i did oh not not the last video but the one prior i did a video of a tree review and it was called humanity og and i was saying how i haven't had some straight og flavor like that in a long time well i have been blessed because this hash taste first of all the hash itself tastes earthy like if you guys ever have hash do you guys ever taste how it tastes like a little more earthy um pioneer like you know a little more like you know like dirt like i don't know how to explain it but hash has like a earthy delicious taste that you it has more of a plant-like taste and also the smell of when you're burning it it smells more like the plant have you got noticed that and that's why i think hatch is so much better because it has i feel like more of a plant like taste from it anyway back to the point of that hash flavor with this insane unquestionably ogn wedding cake like i said the it was unquestionably the og that took the flavor in this straight in this hash combo and i must say i am so happy and i'm so high i feel relieved what it's supposed to do because real kush real og is a hybrid indica dominant but it's a hybrid and right now i feel great all right we're back i had to change the fit real quick you feel me the other day we're about to take you see how big it is that's what she said that's what i told to be cheers and i welcome my dad i must i'm gonna say wow i kind of do know how it tastes like and then this one i did taste it but i still think that the og dominates or maybe it's a good blend because the wedding cake itself is pretty you know pretty potent pretty strong so maybe it's just it enhanced the og i don't know but it is gas and i am hella high all right y'all i'm about i gotta get going though shout out to everybody in the world court that is now part of the royal family i appreciate you all and i'll see you again in the next video", "a6BMDjoAf_0": "[Music] Peggy's going on YouTube it's your boy sub eg backhanded with another banger video for the eyes man for today's video guys as you guys can see by that little intro man I got a bunch of goodies right here man and I thought I was just gonna smoke this by myself this weekend but why not make a video for you guys and let you guys know I think it's gonna be a review

gee KB and man I have heard nothing but good things from like their products man they the fact that 710 labs takes so much pride into the products that they all they do is just put in hard work and the results speak for themselves man they got people talking all over Instagram YouTube Twitter like I'm talking about like everywhere that I go everyone asked me as I have you tried seven ten have you tried seven ten and I've tried their hash rasen but I have not tried their what their Weed Man so I'm very very excited to get into this but for before we get into this man I have to give a big

alright honestly we're like I said I was ready to be smoking on both of these guys they both cost me around this one right here was $80 this one right here with $70 so a total of 150 it is a pretty hefty price to paint but you know if you want to smoke it you got to pay the price so we're gonna save this for the second part of the video we're gonna roll up a nice joint with that but first since I do have my rig right here MJ Arsenal and my torch all the goodies right here I think the only thing we can do is take it out all right so I'm already have been dabbing it so I'm bushed shut you guys in there it might be missing some so this right here guys is what I have currently right now and it's honestly some of the turkeys like 710 miles has to be some of the turkeys but I mean wax that I have ever smelled man like the the Terps in this thing is just so amazing and I kid you not man stabbing on Psalm endless like wax is just so freakin good man thinking about doing is heating this up for 30 about 30 to 35 seconds and then waiting about 45 seconds to 50 seconds I feel like that gives it the best the taste and it's not very harsh smoke yet you get very very milky clouds so let's go ahead and torch this thing up boys cheers i heated it up to 35 seconds I'm gonna go ahead and let it go till 45 just because I had you have the window open man and I'm gonna go ahead and meanwhile though let's go ahead and choose a nice little chunky one just to start things off boys because honestly I have I've only dabbed it once today and I feel like man this one's gonna catch me because I'm telling you the hatch frozen is so smooth that you only really feel it when it starts building up in your chest man so we're about during your second day and still got another ten and yeah let me know in the comments below if you've ever tried 7-10 labs man if you have make sure to hit that like button on this video and if you haven't we'll hit that like button anyways cheers boys oh dude that

done your your nail should look like this man you should still see oil in there and man there's seven ten laps definitely definitely worth that's the $80 that I paid man I would I want to buy the Percy that one right there is $100 I believe or $90 so if you guys want to see a video on the percy live rosin let me know in the comments below like this video and subscribe so auntie dad dad got me super high and I just remember that we also have to smoke another joint so I'm probably gonna step aside from the dabbing and we're gonna go ahead and crack this open man this oh gee Kb your see you guys see how fresh it is man I have not opened it brand new look well you can see the seal right there man this is gonna be the first time guys that I have ever seen this flower in person and I'm kind of excited already it's like a little glimpse right there so let me go ahead and pop this sucker out oh dude oh now just follow my computer oh dude it's as beautiful as the oh oh my goodness dude yo I know my camera is not gonna you know pick up every single watch I'm gonna have to use my phone for this guy's but this but right here you guys know the phone camera picks up every single trichome everything that's why we use the phone and look look at this guy's just look at this you guys are gonna be in all all right so this is the og KB right here look at this dude the beautiful orange hairs I'm talking about look at the trichomes look at the purple little stems think you know oh my gosh the curation on this dude is just so phenomenal I haven't even smelt it what does it smell like I have never saw anything like this smells like me but it's just a different type of legal officer dude this is like literally one of the most aya peeling pieces of bud that I have ever seen and now it's just a fact so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna roll this up I don't know how much help I roll it up but dude this thing is just so phenomenal looking I don't even know if I want to break it apart but I just want to just put this in a casing and just put it in a corner of my room do you never touch it so this thing looks so phenomenal I'm gonna like I said I'm a roll up a joint and I'll see you guys in a little bit right here we got the joint right here man it's honestly I rolled there I've been getting so much better at rolling these freaking joints so all we got to do now man is pretty much just burn off the paperboys and basically here you go here you have it your perfect little or joint now I want to say there's like 1.5 in here man but does it really matter though because I just want to know how good this is man I want to know if it's worth the money because this this 8 was more expensive than a cookie so he hasn't gonna be the first one to find out boys choose only through the age of 18 or 21 whatever it is in your legal statement choose wood hmm after that personation I did get a little bit of some a little bit of paper tape so [Music] whoo it's actually pretty freakin smooth man so far so far I do i I did roll these in some raw hemp papers organic hemp so there might be another reason why but honestly so far it's burning a really really smooth I am getting a lot of earthiness from this plant itself and it's giving off a little bit of a sweet tone but honestly it tastes very very very good like it's something like I know we did we'd look I know we do sweet guys but you can tell the difference from something that is properly cultivated to some [ __ ] that you know that that is make that is being made in mass amounts and things like that like these guys they take so much pride because it's small batch all the time they never they never overdo the batches man because they want to make sure that every single planet that they grow is growing to a hundred percent perfection on their own terms you know but so far man I haven't I'll any clips of this this it's burning very very smooth like I'm telling you let me give you guys a little close-up of pilots burning right I rolled it really really good it's burning even all the way through you got the little tip right there if you ask them to see that and it's an enjoyable smoke man it's currently 10 o'clock in the morning and usually whenever this is the first time I'm smoking also unusually whenever I smoke first my eye like I started coffee or [ __ ] to him whenever it's the first work of a bit but this is smooth like I was saying and it tastes very piney earthy but it's enjoyable as heck I don't taste any really fruitiness flavors of it no I taste a little bit of sweetness but it's not overpowering this thing is chiefing though it's obviously getting me super super baby I ended up waiting a little bit after taking the dabs and then just I mean I rolled out the joint while I was high a [ __ ] and then I roll I waited a little bit more that way I could get the full effects because I didn't want to go from being a super stone because that was a super fat that that I just took I don't want to go from being super stoned to you know getting even more stunning I even being able to differentiate the type of high that I'm getting in the flavor because my mouth was dry as heck I kid you not that dad got me so tight but I was brick and faded for it for a minute I'm not gonna lie I have not been that faded in such a long time and it's such a good feeling now and then they finished chugging milk for sure all boys that looks like we're at had a lighter fluid on our centers [Music] this thing is McEnroe I hope you guys like the new location I mean I'm just in my garage and I hope you guys not like the current location man I was gonna do it in my car but I was like man for a special day like this my mind let's just do it somewhere where you know you guys can see all the smoke around me not the same setting give you guys some a little something different I just in used to Macanese well I'm about to finish this whole joint to the face but not on camera because that would literally turn my videos so freakin long all right guys so my review for this ogk be it's about its max I'm high right now like super faded and it's such a different height such a soothing high but usually with wheat it's either I don't get high or I get like you know too high to the point where I don't even enjoy the high because my head's hurting but this right here yeah but this one right here is honestly just hitting like every single aspect bro like I'm sure I know I know for a fact after I'm done with this I'm probably I'm probably gonna have a better good morning you know I'm already have me good morning gonna go better and EMA like like I would say though I would definitely would not mind dropping another 150 hundred 60 on some 17 laps again like because there I'm telling you they're rosin smack nice it was just the perfect gap the turf through there the taste is there that I was there everything about it was so good and I feel like usually I don't get that feeling with other concentrates you know with other flower so yeah man I would definitely purchase this again time though I do want to try the Persie rosin you know want to try I'm not even sure what kind of strain this was it was like an indica or sativa guessing it's either hinder guard hybrid so next time I want to try just a straight-up indica and see how much that smacks me because I feel like if this give this is smack at me right now I can only imagine what a straight up in meter with you so yeah guys I'm gonna go ahead and hand out the video here because I'm high as a hack right now I just want to enjoy the rest of this man hopefully you guys enjoyed today's video and you know and if you did go ahead and leave a like comment and most importantly hit your boat with that subscribe button

next we're going to have to specify what we are measuring we're going to choose rosin we're going to input our strain after we set our parameters we have to clean the measurement window next we're going to measure the empty cell then we're going to add our sample raws into the empty cell place it on the machine and hit calculate wi-fi cake is definitely potent clocking in at 68 total thc now let's take the rest of our rosin toss it in our decarb capsule and we're going to decarb our rosin at 240 degrees fahrenheit for 20 minutes once our rosin is de-carbed we're going to toss it in the freezer because it'll be much easier to collect and add to our butter next let's add some water to our double boiler and bring the water to a boil go ahead and throw in your butter and let it melt when your butt is pretty melted go ahead and grab your rosin add it to your butter and make sure to stir occasionally until your rosin completely dissolves check this out this is how to do the math to properly dose the equation is pretty simple all you do is you take the amount of rosin you extracted you multiply that by your total thc content that gets multiplied by 10 and then you divide that by the number of servings we figure this butter has about eight servings so each serving is going to have a little less than 82 and a half milligrams of thc thanks for watching and please dose accordingly let us know in the comments below what you plan on making with your rosin infused butter hey guys make sure you check us out at nugsmasher.com to check out all of our awesome products we

getting a big scoop of it I'm thinking to myself and that's like eight bucks right there [ __ ] it this video is for mature audience if you're not a mature audience this video is not for you what's up everybody Cubans here and today we are going to get into some rather expensive concentrates I picked up a gram of some hash rosin today that was priced at $75 and it is one of the most expensive grams of concentrate I have ever purchased so let's take a close look at what we got I've had a gram of Summit connoisseurs genetic and concentrates Tiger's milk and this stuff looks like a nice little slab of peanut butter I'm pretty excited pretty excited abot both so you can get a look at the packaging here this is that Tiger's milk and it's testing at about seventy nine percent THC and then it does have a little bit of CBD a in there but you know what I am so excited for this let's just take it down where are my clothes at let's get a nice nice little scoop here out of the email all fresh and clean and I'm gonna see how it does does [Music] um yeah that was really good I'm gonna actually throw that on a courts now I'm gonna throw that around on a few nails and see if we like it but just to compare I picked up some cheap dabs this cost 75 a gram for some hash rasen 75 bucks for this it's pretty expensive most most of my concentrates I usually find deals and get a lot of good looking stuff like this this is some live batter I got for about 15 bucks a gram one-fifth of the price now sometimes I find live sugars live diamonds of batters around that 15 to 20 dollar price if I'm getting it on a deal it's not the everyday price so begin the deal you can get this stuff cheap so it's really interesting to pay five times as much for a single gram of concentrate I can't I can't believe I did it it's still interesting to me that this costs five times as much as this other gram of some delicious looking stuff but some hash rods and it's hard to come by especially here in Colorado Springs it's not super common to find rosin hash rosin so I guess you got to pay that top dollar because it's so rare but let's get some more dabs of this cone I'm not done with this yet let's see what I'm gonna do some cold starts when you know that this is $75 and you get in a big school but I'm thinking to myself and that's like eight bucks right there okay [Music] it's throwing out a couple bucks in that [ __ ] it [ __ ] it and get a little bit more I need about three-fitty oh we got it okay okay just pricey tab right here damn it all right let's get a nice cold start here and see if it's super delicious on the court oh damn well damn okay okay that's good stuff so I just stabbed it a couple of times here and it's pretty good stuff but is it is it worth it is it worth paying five times as much as I do for some good live banner is it worth is it worth paying five times as much to get some solvent once that's basically the major difference is the fact that it's solvent list most concentrates are made with a solvent it's the easier method it's the most common method but with rosin they use heat and pressure to make it so they just basically squish the THC or they squish the extract out of the nugs or out of hash most of the time they'll make a hash and then they'll press the hash and that's what this is this is a this is hash rosin so it's a little bit more expensive and my understanding is the yield is a little bit lower it's it's a process to make the hash and then when you press the hash you wouldn't get the same type of yield as if you were doing like a butane or propane extraction so I think part of the process is it's a little bit harder to get high-quality product and you're typically going to get less with whatever amount of plant material you go into the process with so I think that affects the price it is pretty rare out here in Colorado Springs not a lot of people are pressing - I can find it in a few places some places have rosin and half chosen but it's not as common as BHO and pho and there's so many dispensaries that grow their own bud and they do their own in-house extractions so something like this I can I can pretty much get really cheap any day of the week if I'm looking around so for me to pay five times as much for this it's a little little far-fetched I honestly I'd rather have five grams of this and haven't done but yet and it's just I like volume I like to do a lot of dub so I'm gonna go back and forth on these we're gonna compare I just want to shave this I got this the same day I kick it costs literally one-fifth the price I'm just gonna see if it's if it's it if it's 20% it's good like it doesn't make oh god I just paid so much money but anyway anyway anyway yeah that's that's solid for the price that's sell it for $15 grand look um I I think it's good I think that that the rosin is good I'm gonna dab the rod let me have a bucket that was that was the I don't even know of the other strain is [Music] [Music] I mean it's definitely better [Music] the Robins better smoother and tastes a little better you can't really compare the highs because I'm better than both back for it but it's all about the taste for me and it is smoother is it pay five times the price smoother [Music] I don't think so because it's not it's not five times as good yeah I don't even know how you would get five times as give it something like this this isn't the best this isn't the best cheap batter that I've got but for something to be five times as good as this would be pretty impressive so this is not five times as good probably not worth five times the price if I see it on deals I may get it but I don't think it's worth anything that's worth three times the price two times the price even thirty forty five bucks I get why it costs so much it's a it's a little bit less common not as many people are making it and you get lower yields with it I get why it it costs more but it's not currently it's not at the price point where it's super worth it for me to only buy rosin maybe if I had a press and I could get amazing yields myself but I don't grow and I don't have any interest in growing so it's like I don't have to buy all my nugs anyway to smash it so kind of interesting I like finding deals so maybe I'll get excited about finding a deal in the future but yeah this isn't actually the most expensive gram of concentrate I've ever purchased a few years ago I remember purchasing a I purchased several grams actually a full melt bubble hash that I got remember the dispensary but I got some full melt bubble I think it was about eighty eight bucks a gram I think I remember paying just under ninety a gram it was really really good stuff it was like some of the craziest stuff I ever spent I I gotta go back and look for some pictures of it cuz it was a few years ago those full mount bubble hash grams I got were like pretty good but after I got a mouse this isn't worth eighty eight bucks a gram what the [ __ ] did I just do so I kind of feel that way here what the [ __ ] that I just do but we made a video that's what the [ __ ] we just did so let's do a few more dabs of this [ __ ] might as well I've only taken out several dollars off of it I don't see if we can take several more I'm interested in the cold start here so let's do that [Music] here's a few dollars [Music] yeah this is good stuff still I wish I could afford you dabs well this was actually pretty fun and I'm pretty blessed after all those naps and I'm glad I finally got to try this rosin up and see it in a bunch of dispensaries even if I did pay money for it but if you liked this video be sure to subscribe for more content in the future and check out my other social media I'll have links in the description below and for my live streams tune in to twitch at twitch.tv slash Cubans if you tune in at night I'm probably live right now getting high dabbing some much cheaper than than $75 a gram rosin unless you tuned in very shortly after this is made that I might have some of this left but uh come hang out and we'll see you next time [Music] I would say perfect balance but I'm going [Music] [Music] [Music]", "zOxoyfpTVeQ": "[Music] alright guys I'm gonna go in here I'm gonna try to get some awesome that my guy on Instagram makes Greg 17 Greg he's got the seventh in between the Greg definitely is gonna count the follow right there i'ma go up in there tried to get some of that rosin and I may get some other things too that you guys like I said we'll see in the future and we'll see what they got alright I got a couple different things here as you can see I've got a couple of pre-rolls I've got a live rosin as well which is one of the main reasons I went by jungle boys I wanted to try their live rosin batter which Greg 7/10 Greg he makes that it makes a lot of it and you can follow him on Instagram with the 7th in between the Greg and that's how I even find him on Instagram an amazing page that guy is just absolutely way ahead of anything in this industry he's more than an expert that's for sure so I had to pick up some of that you got jungle boys full mouth jungle boys rosin jungle boys and jungle boys clothing that's all their pages and of course Greg and I'll mention a couple other ones down in the description for you guys to follow first of all let's look at the prices I we got the joints right here and as you can see there are $12 a piece including the tax so I mean they're lower a dollar cheaper than the joints we got back home and that's here in LA now there bud is a little bit more expensive I have that on another video for you guys if you're buying recreational it's 26 dollars a gram so I just got some pretty rolls right here and I've already actually smoked that Topanga Canyon that was just an amazing experience right there it was like great be I see with like a hint of like almost mint and it was it was really amazing so I already smoked that one and I'm gonna probably smoke the jungle cake in the morning twenty nine percent THC 291 milligrams total their strains are really high like that though they come in and extremely high some of them do now I smoked another one out here the last time though mimosa that was only like 16 percent and it was actually one of the better strains I smoked so twenty-nine percent on that one we also have cookies and cream and this one is coming in at 27 percent 277 milligrams in that 135 percent total cannabinoids Topanga Canyon yeah that one I just smoked was nice 25 percent it's that was like a in akadama net hybrid it was a oh gee Topanga Canyon oh gee really good really good I was like a great be gassy skunky with a hint of mint almost does what I would have to say describe that like and the other thing we got is the live rosin and that is a hundred and ten dollars a gram now we don't quite have anything like this back home and of course I can't really you know compare this to back home but I had to get some of that it's a hundred and ten dollars a gram recreational and I think it was a hundred dollars a gram medical I could be wrong on that price but it was one hundred and ten dollars for me including tax recreational for for this one gram right here", "A4liVeDhO6g": "[Music] shoot [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] one [Music] so [Music] so [Music]

extraction explained profiting from rosin my name is Eric sandy and the digital editor of cannabis business times in this exclusive webinar pure pressures director of marketing Eric glass key will give you the tools strategies and key information on how to capitalize on the quickly growing solvent extraction segments of the cannabis market focus on actionable insights this webinar will cover solvent list concentrates across every aspect Eric will explain exactly what saltless concentrates are which eske use are the most popular how to cultivate or source material that yields well for Robins and how to attract customers to your brand just a few quick housekeeping notes before we begin you'll notice on your screening questions box please do feel free to type in your questions as the presentation is going on and I will relay them to Eric at the end and also know that if you have to leave any time we will be recording this presentation both the audio and video and emailing the full archive link to all registrants in a few days here so you will have access to to the whole presentation with that I'm very pleased to welcome today's presenter Eric Blackie thank you Eric appreciate the time in the intro and I also appreciate everyone who's tuned in right now this presentation was designed with you guys in mind and it's going to be really focused on educating everyone about what solvent list is and how you can incorporate it into your business profitably so to get started just going to do a quick intro here and go over what our agenda is so everyone gets an idea of what the cadence just like Eric just said my name also Eric I'm the director of marketing and now business development with peer pressure I joined in 2016 and I'm also the marketing and brand strategist for peer Cannell abs which is our sister consulting agency I've been working in the cannabis industry for just about there is now big passion for what's going on it's awesome to see the growth in the industry so today's agenda first I'm going to be talking about what is solvent list we're going to be going through kind of the layman's overview of solving Wisconsin traits and all concentrates just as they fit into the market in general so the point of this is we're going to be talking both to total beginners intermediate as well as people who have quite a bit of experience here so I believe that anyone who's tuning in no matter how much knowledge you have about concentrates or cannabis in general you'll be able to take some great insights away from this presentation then we're going to start talking about solvent with skews and some of the products that can be made solvent lessly as well as market data that supports where the market fit is what kinds of products these are as well as giving you guys some ideas about who are purchasing these products although some of that information is a little bit more anecdotal then we're going to be talking about material identification this is one of the biggest topics in solvent lists you know how do I get the right starting material to yield well to work well to make those super high-end concentrates then I'm going to wrap it all up with you know really the top key tips and ways to frame your thinking about how to be successful with solvent lists you know high-level points that you can take and implement immediately and then we're going to leave about 15 or 20 minutes at the end for Q&A so that I can make sure that I can get through as many of your guys questions as possible so with that being said the focus of this webinar is going to be on the THC side of cannabis in solvent lists I will be touching on CBD as well but just so everyone knows going into it CBD is going to be a little bit more of a footnote for this presentation so let's get started so what is solvent list there's a lot of terms out there but a solvent was cannabis concentrate is one that is made without any solvents so it's butane co2 or ethanol this extraction method is also known as mechanical separation now there's no governing body dictating which words people are using in the cannabis industry now it's still a bit of a Wild West situation and we're hoping that in the near future there will be a little bit more clarity around this but some people say that water for example is a solvent I would argue that it's not water in the solvent was processed for bubble hash or ice water hash which we'll get to soon you're separating the trichomes from the plant material and trying to keep them intact whereas if you're performing light hydro carbon co2 or other solvent based methods it's actually a process of dissolution so that's an important distinction here that solvent lists for the most part is getting a mechanical separation and then rosin which we're going to get into in a lot of detail here shortly is expressing and filtering those isolated trichome heads so solvent list fits in to the market as the craft beer of the concentrate world it is the high-end artisan level concentrate that the huge brand builder for any business that's processing or manufacturing cannabis products you want to think about this as the same kind of consumer that's interested in organic fruits and foods that's also going to be the type of person that's interested in solvent list because well to give it full credit with butane co2 and other methods you can purge the vast majority of those residual solvents you really can almost get to actual zero percent solvent or having a product that has never touched them in the first place the only way you can do that is with solvent list now another question that we get a lot is what does solvent 3 mean versus solvent list solvent free means that it doesn't contain any solvents when it reaches the customer but that it did contain solvents or solvents were used in the production of it so there's a whole subset of customers that will only buy solvents products and if you are not making a solvent list product of one variety whether it's a dab mobile concentrate an edible or a topical you're not even in their consideration set so that's why it's important to recognize that having us almost concentrate is an important part of any processing or manufacturing business plan so to move on to the next section some people who have been in the industry a long time are going to know all this already but for everyone who's tuning in who's a little bit new to the concentrate world or is really just getting their feet under them about what kinds of concentrates are out there I figured that it would be helpful to throw in this a fairly busy chart about where current concentrates in the cannabis industry fall so on the left side of the chart here you can see what we've got are the solvent list and of concentrates dry sift sometimes also known as Keith bubble hash also known as ice water hash and Robin and those three products of course are going to be what the vast majority of our focus is spent on today but it's also important to know what the solvent based concentrates are and to clear up something about distillate so that distillate can actually be made with solvents or without you can do terpene separations with steam that wouldn't constitute as using solvent and then you can also see at the bottom here all of the different textures and types of oils that these various extraction methods can make now this is the current state of these extraction methods but whatever one should keep in mind is that things are evolving very rapidly across the space innovation is happening as quickly as anyone can keep up with core solvent lists and solvent based so one thing that's not in this graph that people might be wondering is what about flour rosin that's a product I've heard about I've tried I've seen it that is not a separate process necessarily we just lump that into the general category of rosin so one thing that might stand out to people that aren't as familiar with the rosin process or maybe even familiar with the hydrocarbon process is that there is a significant amount of textures and different products which we'll get into a lot of detail on with making rosin you know a lot of people coming into this think well you know I I would like to make a dabble concentrate product it has a high price per gram I've heard you know there's a lot of brands out there that really made a name for themselves with this but what can I really do with rosin and the answer is with minimal post-processing you can come out with an enormous variety of different oil textures and resulting products so live rosin coming from fresh frozen material straight separated terpenes which can be used for all kinds of things a very popular product category right now diamonds also known as diamonds and sauce sauce meaning separated terpenes kind of the street word or the colloquial sense of that you can even make shatter wax butter sugar oil there's all kinds of different textures that can be made now there is some variability in your starting material so that's why we've got dry sift and bubble hash there on the left and that you typically have the most versatility with all of the different kinds of robins that you can make when you are starting with bubble hash and bubble hash really consist of just pure isolated trichome heads and the same goes for dry Civ again really going back just briefly to what mechanical separation means we're trying to isolate trichome heads get rid of the plant debris and plant material that we're capturing the pure essence of the plant the resin which is contained in those trichomes and then that gives you a lot of a lot more flexibility to create all kinds of other products now you'll see one product on here that hydrocarbon can make that rosin can't is crumble which is a popular texture but for the most part rosin is capable of creating just about every texture of oil Under the Sun both in high end a beable concentrate form as well as food grade form four topicals edibles and all kinds of things and then well co2 and ethanol are both extremely popular concentrate and processing methods the actual end resulting products are a little bit more limited now those can be used in all kinds of things as well but the whole point here is to just give everyone a sense of how much variety and how many different textures can be made and that textures are not confined to one processing method or another in virtually all cases so moving along this is going to be for a full disclaimer the only time in this entire presentation that you're going to see anything about the products that we sell or what we do peer pressure is an equipment manufacturer in the solvent with space and this is an overview of the general equipment that's needed to make these kinds of products so not doing sales we're not doing plugs but just wanted to give everyone that disclaimer while I explain the slide this is about the only time you're going to encounter this so for dry sift how it's made is with a sifting machine I've got an example here the green bros alchemist 420 that's got stainless steel screens that trim or flower is put in it's graded against those screens which shears the trichome heads off which are then collected and can be used for a variety of different purposes just like we were talking about all kinds of different boy close in like we'll get into different SKUs and product themselves now there's a little note there plus static cleanup typically if you're trying to make a very high-end dry sip product the keys coming out of your grinder isn't going to fit the bill you're going to need to do some additional static cleanup to be able to get as much of the debris out as possible so that you can have better isolated trichome heads now bubble hash this is the extraction method that we'll spend a little bit more talking time talking about today excuse me because of the versatility that I was mentioning in the last slide and it comes with a little bit more equipment to execute on properly you have to wash it you need a drain vessel that the ice water is being used to go in it's being filtered and then it's ultimately freeze-dried so whereas dry sip is a dry process with dry cured material either trim or flour or popcorn bubble hash or ice water hash is done with ice and water which the cold temperatures and the water and agitation help detach those trichome heads which are then filtered graded and dried and then at the end of all of this unless you're selling just a straight bubble hash product of which there's a couple varieties or a dry security product which again there's different grades and varieties it's all pressed on a Robin press so all of the textures that we were just talking about in the last slide that large kaleidoscope of different products that can come out of solvent list those are all made on one piece of equipment and that is a rousing press so or we get into some data and start talking about them skews I wanted to go over a couple of solvent list facts and myths these are some important points that we get asked about constantly and I'm sure people in the audience right now are already thinking about this or we're potentially already planning to ask these questions so is solvent list less potent than BHO or perhaps other concentrates and the testing answer is no it's not depending on the product coming out the other end with rosin you can get potency ranges anywhere from sixty to ninety nine percent and on that super high end that's a THCA isolate so you can actually isolate thb a with mechanical separation a little bit of a long word there chain of words but the potency is absolutely comparable depending on what the starting material is second thing does CBD play nice with solvent list short answer is sometimes we're not going to spend a lot of time talking about this but for all the people in the audience who are either hemp farmers or are using hemp and are interested in how solvent lists will work with your CBD product it absolutely can it really comes down to the starting quality of your CBD so if you've got field hemp to be perfectly honest with everyone here that tends to not work so well with salt processes if you've got boutique high-end grown CBD it tends to work a lot better the solvent less offer comparable yield this is another one of the biggest myths that we're constantly combating you know with high quality material and we'll talk in depth about this you're going to find that yields are extremely comparable or right up just on top of other popular processing methods such as hydro carbon co2 ethanol things like that now yield is a little bit of a tricky question because it depends so much on what your starting material is what you're trying to get out the other end and really what you're trying to accomplish and that where we've learned a lot over the last couple years in the solvent of space is that with a solvent was product you need to think about it by making your high-end if that's what you're shooting four and then multiple washes or multiple presses to get all of the remaining oil out so that you can have what is more considered a full yield so that you're getting you know using all parts of the Buffalo as it were and then lastly is solvent less expensive to produce so very short answer is no it's not solvent list tends to be significantly less expensive in terms of equipment regulatory needs than hydrocarbon co2 and other extraction methods not only is the equipment quite a bit cheaper objectively you're also going to find that you don't need a C one D one room in your state if that's required for hydrocarbon regulators tend to look a lot more favorably on solvent lists and are more likely to grant it in your lab because the safety aspect of it is not in question due to high pressure or flammable solvents so it tends to be if not the least expensive extraction method to get started with so now none of this would be complete without going through some important market data so first we're going to start with a bunch of data that we've pulled from the MJ biz 2019 Factbook I plug MJ business back book every seminar that I ever do we are not affiliated with MJ biz in any way but they have some of the best data in the entire industry now there's going to be slides throughout this presentation that reference data from headset and other places but for everyone who's tuned in the webinar now if you are interested in really really getting into the nitty-gritty with market data product data every kind of cannabis data that you could imagine the MJ biz back book is probably the best place to find it so again we received zero financial incentives plugging them we just really liked their data and for everyone who's here trying to learn things highly suggest checking them out it's a great source to learn so most of this data I believe was pulled before everything happened with Co vid 19 but with that being said we're still seeing many of these signs happening now and that it seems that people are extremely optimistic in the processing market and we're hearing that for many of our other industry partners as well so cannabis processors in the next 12 months their outlook is saying 92 percent are expecting a better outlook that's a lot that is a major majority and if you even include the 4 percent that's the same you're looking at a vast majority of cannabis processors expecting to encounter better conditions in the next 12 months now that's a little bit open-ended they didn't explain exactly what better means necessarily but that means that a lot of cannabis processors who are already in the space and doing this are optimistic about what's going to happen over the next year now processors that are planning to expand into new markets over the next 12 months 81 percent of them are so that is a pretty telling number that another key figure here is that the vast majority of cannabis processors are planning to expand their operation I struggle to think of any other industry where this kind of thing is happening processors are expanding they are feeling that things are looking good and then this last data point here on the slide it stands out a little bit because it doesn't seem to fit in with the others but wholesale cultivators are indicating that high quality is 40 excuse me 46 percent of wholesale cultivators are going for high-quality as the key differentiating factor for the products that they're selling now that's extremely important because high quality material is one of the key aspects to ensuring that you can create some of the high-end solvent 'less products that we spoke about earlier so it means that access to high-quality material is likely increasing for businesses either entering the space or for businesses that are not fully vertically integrated and have to source material from wholesale cultivators so organic at 23% is also great because organic material tends to be very very good with solvent list and then you see below that low cost grown sustainably terpene content value and other those are pretty minor you know high quality material and organic material seems to be what more wholesale cultivators are focusing on meaning that processors are going to have access to more material and better material hopefully now the next slide and this is the number two executive summary take away in the MJ biz 2019 fact book this is a little bit to take in so a lot of numbers a lot of words I'm going to try and walk everyone through this so that you can really take this nugget of wisdom away so gray unprofitable blue break-even green profitable pretty easy to understand that now this graph is telling us that the number of SKUs produced has a dramatic effect on reported profitability from the businesses that participate pated and answered the survey that mjp is put out to gather this data so that red box at the bottom what you're going to see is a massive increase in reported profitability for businesses that are having 11 to 15 different skews compared to 1 to 3 so if you're a processor and you're only making a handful of different products reported profitability is absolutely tiny whereas businesses that are producing multiple SKUs and again it seems at this time like the perfect range is around 11 to 15 83% of them are reporting profitability again it's hard to overstate how dramatic of a difference that actually is and even you're seeing businesses that produce 7 to 10 different unique products are reporting three three times as many of those businesses are reporting profitable or profitability over businesses that are doing 4 to 6 and then it's 16 plus you start seeing a little bit of a drop-off although it's still a strong increase over the businesses that are only producing tenfold and then at the top of this graph it's really showing that processors that offer products across multiple categories meaning hydrocarbon solvent lists ethanol different areas of extraction almost half of them report profitability so when you combine offering multiple products in different categories with different types of SKUs that's really where you hit the sweet spot of being able to come up with a balanced product line that addresses as many consumers needs in a dispensary as possible there's always going to be consumers that are looking for the cheapest gram of flour they can buy just like there's always concentrate customers that are only going to be looking for the highest end solvent list that's on the Shelf it's important for any business to produce multiple SKUs and to have SKUs across different categories so tying all of these thoughts together with the data that we just reviewed adding solvent list concentrate is one of if not the least expensive ways to add additional SKUs to your product lineup and is one and a set of SKUs that are highly sought after by connoisseurs and influencers so make sure that you are offering enough SKUs to really help give you the best shot at increasing your profitability and becoming profitable and hitting that break-even point if you have not already cool so now to spend some time shifting gears pretty completely going away from market data and giving some more explanations about what kind of popular solvent with SKUs are out there so there's a lot of text on this slide and on the next one I'm not going to read every single one word for word I would highly encourage anyone to go back to the recording and dig through this a little bit more if there are some parts of these SKUs that you're interested in learning a bit more about or simply asking the question here in the webinar and I'll answer those at the end the number one SKU that we're seeing sold in the market right now is ice hash water rosin this has a very high price per gram it's the top sold rosin product and it's a connoisseur grade concentrate that build brands and loyal buyers okay I read off the first one I can do that for all them the big thing about having solvent with products of virtually any variety is that they can win over influencers and brand builders that are going to talk about your products a lot more than some of the more entry-level less expensive products and we've got clients who where perhaps the vast majority of the revenue they generate is off of some of the more entry or budget-friendly concentrates or products but that they really have built their brand on the backs of their ice water hash rods in their bubble hash robin and directly to that hash robin based cartridges becoming extremely popular now takes quite a bit of an RD but these are the most expensive the most sought-after and at this current time a fairly rare product we're seeing those go from anywhere from fifty to eighty dollars a half gram and it really is the ultimate cannabis product for multiple consumers talking about sift there's of course dry sift rosin tends to retail for less than ice water - rosin but it has a lot of versatility with a lot of different grades and quality now solve them with edibles are another area that's really seeing tremendous growth right now and another opportunity that multiple businesses should be thinking about if they're not already the number three edibles in California according to headsets state by state sales database data is a solvable settable in the past it was the number one edible and that's a key book product so these edibles tend to retail for 20% more than standard edibles or more depending on the market and you can use a lower grade starting material to get a food grade oil to make it work additionally there's a couple more SKUs that we're going to talk about here solvent was topicals and bombs the number one through five topicals or bombs in california are made solvent lessly and they're all Papa and Barclays products they're 50 milliliter tincture that goes for about sixty six dollars I believe their products range from you know fifteen dollars but they do command a premium and they are a true full-spectrum quality product made with again solvent list food grade oil that's put into premium topicals now you've also got full melt ice water hash which is something that a lot of people who've been around the industry for a while will be familiar with and this is the ultimate product for connoisseurs this is pure isolated trichome heads that melt without leaving any residue now the actual sales volume for full melt ice water hash isn't terribly high but if you have high enough quality material to create it this is what wins over connoisseurs like no other the bottom left we've got flour rosin this is an entry level robin product more popular in certain markets and others typically less mature or less developed markets because it's such an easy way to get started you can literally just take a dried cured flour put it in a Robin press squish it out and you've got flour rosin it does tend to retail for less than hash and stiff problem however and then finally we've got hash you use pre rolls this is the number five pre roll in Colorado it's been as high as number one in the past I updated all of these numbers this morning just to make sure that I was providing accurate data for everyone but they also command a pretty hefty premium on how much they sell for typically these are pre rolls that are infused with bubble hash sometimes with sift or key to but as you everyone can see there is a lot of variety here in terms of what kinds of different SKUs that someone can make in order to be successful with solvent list so through these this is kind of scratching the surface because underneath topicals and bombs and edibles especially there are so many different varieties from tinker's bone gummies brownies I mean you name it if there's a product that you're particularly interested in that you love that your market loves can be made with solvent list that product can command a premium and that you can do it without having to throw down hundreds of thousands of dollars in equipment purchasing okay now we're going to move on to some of the most important parts of this presentation and why I think a lot of people are tuning in in the first place which is to really understand how they can be successful with solvent lists and what they need to be looking for in the first place to do this so one thing before we jump into genetic selection that I just wanted to show everyone real fast as a EndNote on the versatility of rosin is that these eight products were all made from a single bubble hash string one of our consultants that we work with and since Alden was on instagram whoever is on Instagram I'd highly encourage you to follow him he does some of the best work in the industry he took one strain of bubble hash and set out to figure out how many different SKUs how many different products can I just make with bubble hash that are dabble concentrate this says nothing about cartridges or edibles or topicals you can see just a loan this is eight different textures that are being produced from one single strain of bubble hash all at very different you know levels of interest depending on the consumer so just really driving home the point that there's a lot more versatility with solvent list than a lot of people realize you so now how do I take solvent list and make it successful for my business and the most important thing to start with when you're going down this road and really trying to figure this out is how to understand trichome structure you can't just put any strain in with solvent list and have it be successful and the reason for that is because of the trichomes and the resin content because we're not dissolving the resin out of the plant material with the solvent and we're detaching it mechanically the actual size and shape of the trichome that the plant produces are absolutely critical to getting a yield that's going to be profitable for your business and for making a product that consumers are going to be excited about the one that's sitting on the shelf so in this slide and there's going to be two slides talking about trichomes here we see ABC those are all mid-range or below so AC e and F these are tiny you can see that you know 20 microns 50 microns 20 micron 10 10 these are very very very small try trichomes and when you're doing an ice-water hash filter process or a sip process typically the microns below 45 tend to be food grade and they're still very useful but they don't get captured nearly as well as the example D which is the capitate stock trichome that has a large glandular head full of resin a fairly large stock this is a very resinous trichome at the large size it's pretty much the ideal shape and type to process ultimately whether you're making bubble hash flour Robin stick rather than whatever it is so the cheapest way that you can figure this out without spending a ton of money on a microscope or another product is just to get a jeweler's loupe it's not going to have a micron rating on it but it will give you a much better idea of what type of trichomes you're dealing with I mean you could literally buy a cheap one for 10 or 15 dollars on eBay so really getting into your plant or your plant or the strain that you want to put through your solvents process and looking at it at the nearly microscopic level that is what's going to help you first determine if that strain is going to be viable for solvents or not additionally and I just came across this earlier this week and I've got to give credit where it's absolutely do which is to farm house to do genetics they're based in the northwest and this strange sugar coat which is pictured here with bred specifically super saltless now something that you're going to start hearing a lot more about is trichome detach ability because again saying is over and over we're talking about mechanical separation how well do your trichome neatly detach from the plant material so that they could be captured isolated and then processed so the perfect hash trichome has a thin neck a medium length stock and a large glandular head now I think farmhouse coined this term because I haven't heard anywhere else before this is the week next trichome which provides optimal detachment so if you see where the arrow is pointing look at how thin and narrow that little bridge is between the stock and the head that means with even very very gentle agitation that should detach easily and be able to be captured so there's a lot of genetic companies out there that are now breeding strains specifically for saltless which is often to see making it that much more viable and that much more profitable at the same time again it really comes down to understanding what your plants can do before you commit to large runs whereas with a solvent based extraction method you kind of just throw it in and run it and go from there with solvent lists you need to pay a lot more attention not only to the quality of your material but the types of trichomes that your material is actually making so you're probably asking okay this all looks good these trichome examples are really cool but what kinds of strains are we talking about here so I've got good news for you if you want to screenshot this please go ahead again this will be available in the recap that will be sent to everyone but I've come up with a nice healthy list of different strains that people can take advantage of and their own grows and start feeling hunting for now what's important to also understand is just because you go pick up a Ken dog off of one of many seed websites or from a friend that does not guarantee that that strain of Ken dog is going to have that trichome structure or the resin content by raw potency that's going to be a winner with solvent list these are strains however that we see our clients running constantly that we see mentioned on Instagram constantly and are a great place to start for anyone that's either struggling a little bit to get some strains that are really producing well for saltless or if they're before they're even getting started and you're vertically-integrated going to grow your own material these are ones that you can actually look into getting seeds getting cuts talking to people and starting with these you're you're going to see many of the best hash makers across the world are washing drying and pressing many of these strains crosses of these strains these are some of the most popular lineages in the entire cannabis space for solvent was processing now with that being said things are changing all the time there's always new genetics that are coming out and for those of you who are tuning in who are not vertically integrated meaning you're not cultivating your own product you don't have quite as much control over the supply chain of the cannabis that you happen to be processing it's really important to ask the wholesaler that you're buying your cannabis from that you intend to process has this material been washed do you have other customers who have watched this material is this going to be a strain that's going to play nice with solvents we never advise customers or people who are looking to get into solvent list to blindly go out by tens of pounds of fresh frozen hundreds and start washing it and hope for the best you really need to talk to whoever you're buying your cannabis from or whoever your grower is that's responsible for growing strength having a much better understanding of will this strain provides right trichome structure and have the right resin content so that I can be profitable with my solvent with processing methods so really doing a little bit more digging putting a bit more of the onus on the cultivator of the provider to help provide you with some strains and material and some solutions that will be successful for solvent processing so my favorite of all of this list right now is the Tropicana cookies by Oni Seco there are too many genetic companies to name that are excellent but there's so many good profiles and these are some of the top shelf screens just for flour in general that are now being refined into you know what are considered to be the best concentrates perhaps in the entire world and that sugar-coat strain that we were just showing with the weconnect trichome farmhouse genetics farmhouse studios you know excuse me told me that that strain and those seeds will be available pretty soon so I would definitely make sure to follow them on Instagram and get an idea of when those are dropping because we expect that those will sell out very quickly but hard to go wrong with starting with any of these ok so we're going to get into the end here and really wrap this all up for everyone now before we do the full wrap-up it's really important to understand what kind of space you're going to be operating in and for a lot of businesses and the question that we get constantly is how much space do I need to do all this this sounds great I want to make these products this equipment sounds good I've got good material or I know someone because how do I get my space going less than a thousand square feet is very common for saltless operations or divisions you would be surprised to see that some of the best concentrates in the solvent list world and in the world in general are being made in what almost look like closets and very small areas so that a lot of square footage is definitely not necessary unless you're trying to really scale up your operation and do very high volume now the scalability of solvent list is something that has changed a lot recently there's a lot of innovation happening and that this can scale well above that and you've got operations that are saying thousand square feet you know I've got 50,000 square feet to work with how can you help me there short answer is you don't need a lot to get started but as you scale of course you'll need a little bit more space to produce more proper force and ceiling height planning is also important you know getting started with this and this is something that we offer as a service as well is helping with floor plans but that really understanding how all of the pieces of equipment that you need to produce the products that you're trying to bring to market how do they fit into your lab how many of them do you need where do they go these are all very critical things to think about before you put pen to paper and because most regulators demand this information before you're even allowed to open up shop or make any changes anyway and then again wrapping that up developing a predetermined processing space flow will save you time and money and it can always be modified as you grow as you change as you make different products you're not set in stone on these things but just making a point that having some adequate planning ahead of time will really save a lot of headache and increase your profitability long dress now take everything that we just talked about here are the top four ways that your business can succeed with solemn list and the number one way is know your market and what it wants you know people on the west coast in California Colorado very mature market their appetite for 60 to $80 or more grams of hash rosin is a lot higher than it is on the East Coast at least in the illicit markets now what you're going to find is that every market in its stage of maturity or development is going to grow from extreme interest in just raw flour to more concentrates more products more flavor profiles so it's really important to understand you know what are dispensaries that you're trying to work with or already working with what are they saying what are they selling so before you go all-in on trying to get the holy grail of making a robin cartridge there are some steps along the way that you need to make and you want to make sure that your market is ready for that product and that you're going to be successful with it the second is the source or cultivate premium quality material for dabble products only that's the key here is that if you're trying to make a dabble concentrate the quality of your material is tantamount to success or failure out the other end for what you're trying to do make sure to test that material before you commit to a full batch processing you know just like we're talking about jeweler's loupe look at the trichome really understand what you're doing now if you're making a topical or an edible I'm not saying that you can use lower quality material you can you don't have to but that more of a food grade oil a trim anything along those lines can absolutely fit the bill for edibles assuming that of course it passes contamination testing because the solvent 'less process does not offer any sort of remediation the same way that your tain does for example so premium quality material for dab mobile products is absolutely critical additionally environmental controls really are the difference maker for true top-shelf solvents concentrates you know having a cold room when you're making bubble hash ensuring that your room is clean that you have a good process down these are all things that we've got numerous videos and blogs about that you can dig into the details on but environmental control is extremely important to really make those ultra high-end concentrates and then my last big piece of advice for everyone who's taken the time with me so far to get all the way here a be mindful of creating multiple products with your source material don't just make a bubble hash and then sell a full spectrum bubble hash make and pull so make and sell a full spectrum bubble hash and a food-grade you know topical or edible or take the extra leftovers and put it in a pre-roll there's so many different options to get your full yield and to make more money from your solvent products than just coming out with one thing or two things you've got a lot more options at your fingertips so check in see what people in your market are interested in what they're buying and then work from there so that wraps up the presentation I really appreciate everyone coming pretty much right on the dot 15 minutes for QA Eric if you want to start shooting some questions my way I'd be happy to start answering sounds great well thank you so much Eric that was really fantastic and very nicely detailed we do have a number of questions that have come in and I'll just remind it or when you'll see a questions box on your screen so please do type in your questions we've got about 15 minutes here Eric we've got a number of questions about about yield and trichome detach ability I'm going to try to sort of bake them into one question however however they'll probably a couple questions here really but how do you measure yield and how do you in terms of sourcing genetics how do you know what you're getting before taking out the jeweler's loupe and looking closely I guess some what should what should folks be looking for when trying to measure trichomes and trying to plan for yield yeah great question what it comes down to is this selection process that experienced processors have really refined over time you know coming into it as a newcomer where you don't have that ability it's almost a sixth sense where you can look at a bud or fresh frozen plan or a plan even before it's been cut down and say wow this is a very resinous strain it smells really good the blood structure is not super dense or super lar fee you know very light so you know for everyone who's tuned in that doesn't have the sixth sense of the master processor it's really important to know you know has this strain been grown before by this cultivator and what's it testing at if you've got more juice to squeeze you're gonna have a better shot at having a salt most product you know whereas if it's a very low potency strain there's just not as much resin there to expel to extract so that's the first component of it too and then having an honest conversation with your grower with the cultivator whoever is involved and just asking them questions you know do you have any experience excuse me with doing the solvent lessly either with your own business if they're legally allowed to process or do they have they talked to anyone else who's familiar with the strain that process it solvent what it's really a combination of you know using your spidey sense to say is this plant got enough resin to work with and does the person who's producing it have details about whether or not it's been processed solemnly before or do they think that it will process well solvent lessly and then I'm sure you've got a lot of questions about yield so should I just go directly into that or do you have one specifically that I should answer yeah one one question maybe just a frame the conversation about yield here is how can folks know that the yield is deriving from this extraction process is the greatest potential yield meaning how can they know they're not missing or missing out on the program the catch ability we're talking about yep another or another really important question and it's it's really hard to drill down and say that strain X I will get and reclaim 98 percent of the available trichome mass because of the budge structure versus strain Z which I can only expect to get 95 percent total reclamation or something like that but what it really comes down to is taking an experimentation process so if you're washing bubble hash you will wash two or three times until all you're getting anymore is basically just plant material and debris and then you said okay my trichomes are spent or if you're pressing hash or flower essence if Robin you know pressing those first couple bags multiple times to understand like where does where is the road end with this material one can I not get any more out of it and then backing into your math about what are your yields what was your cost to produce it or acquire it and then you know getting into your spreadsheet and trying to figure out did this strain make money for me or before committing to processing a whole bunch of it you know moving on to a different one we have a little story we're talking with a client of ours and they washed at Angie strain that they grew put it all out there boss program to produce that strain was about 135 dollars that was just their production cost and they said whoa you know I can't you know I'm not going to make any money on this so they only did a small test batch figured out the yield wasn't too good and now they just sell that strain either through hydrocarbon processing or is just whole flour it's very successful whereas for some of their other hash strains I think it might have been Tropicana cookies Alain but I was talking about you know their cost per gram to produce that was closer to eight to ten dollars or a little bit more of hash rousing because it made so much hash it had such a good yield that their production cost went way way down and that's one of the winners that they wash and produce and sell constantly so you know you have to take a little bit of a holistic approach but really trying to get as much out of whatever you're doing if possible and then working into the numbers to see if it makes sense yeah we have a couple questions here about just the different factors that go into these products and obviously we've talked a lot about source product and that the genetics that are going into solvent list products but what other factors can kind of folks influence whether that's temperature or pressure what other factors might go into this process and what are some quick tips to really improve those yeah so all along the solvent list processing chain you're going to have all kinds of variables assuming you know if you're either growing the material yourself starting there you know how is the material being grown is it indoor/outdoor there's almost too many variables to mention on the cultivation side of things so I'm going to focus my answer on attraction side which is where I know significantly more about and that's having high variable control is extremely important to be able to come out with a consistent product so that's something that we at peer-pressure really really focus on is having the most precise and replicatable you know variable control with the equipment that we make and sell so that being able to create a consistent product by controlling your time your temperature your pressure how hot or cold the room that you're working in is there's all these different data points that someone is going to want to understand so that they can compare one strain against another in the most scientific way possible in order to better understand you know is this a product that consumers want it's a product that we're producing consistently and is the end result something that we feel that we can replicate consistently so with the extraction process it really comes down to time pressure temperature for rosin and then with ice water hash its water temperature environmental temperature sift a little bit less variable control a little bit more post-processing cleanup so because we don't have a ton of time left here I would again encourage anyone who's interested in getting tips and tricks on pressing rods in on making ice water hatch I'm making sift anything in between our YouTube channel go peer pressure our blog which is on our website go peer pressure com we've got in-depth articles on all of these topics so I would highly encourage everyone to go check those out and do some reading some watching excellent yeah a few folks were asking about additional resources that's great um there could you speak to the impact of freezing the material before say a bubble hash process and whether that might yield better results yeah absolutely and this is a webinar that I gave trying to reach a very broad audience in the future I will give a webinar that's more intermediate and advanced solvent lists we didn't really touch on fresh frozen very much in this now fresh frozen is when you take cannabis and you D fan it take all families off and then you immediately freeze it now doing a fresh frozen product is what can create what's called a live product so you I'm sure you've heard of waif resin made with hydrocarbon or live rosin which is the ice water hash process that's then taking a material that's never been dried or cured so when you don't dry or cure your flour you d pan it and freeze it that tends to give a flavor profile and a terpene profile as well as changes in the cannabinoids because it hasn't been dried or cured that many consumers prefer over a dried and cured starting material for the concentrate now there's a lot of debate about this but for a business owner having fresh frozen material as your starter for bubble hash specifically is one of the smartest moves you can make because not only are you creating a product that the majority of dabble concentrate consumers are looking for anyway but also you don't need the infrastructure or the time to go ahead and dry and carefully cure your material which as many growers and people who have grown who tuned in understand is one of if not the most difficult parts of the entire cultivation process drying and curing your flower perfectly is and more than it is a science and that that can be very difficult to do so by having freezers and freezing your material to make a fresh frozen you are skipping that headache entirely you of course need freezers to store your material in but that the cold temperatures also actually increase trichome detach ability because they are more brittle so for multiple reasons both from a consumer standpoint a business ROI standpoint an equipment standpoint a space standpoint doing fresh frozen makes sense for most businesses excellent we have a question here if without access to specific screens at the moment could you talk about the idea of practicing or optimizing the process using lower quality strains that may have less optimal trichome structure and whether that will whether that practice will will really help the grower or whether that I'd be leading them down maybe an unhelpful ya know that that's a really good question um typically when someone or a business or a group of people are trying to get familiar with the solvent list process using material that they don't necessarily expect to process and then ride all the way home to the bank is a great way to really get your chops under you because you've got a lot more margin for error and you could really get the techniques down a lot better if the stakes aren't quite so high so I would say that you know lower quality starting material mid mid grade and below is actually a very important tool in the solvent was processors arsenal because it can a teach the team teacher extractors how to do all of this very well before your top shelf top cola buds are on the line to be processed perfectly and also a lot of the mid grade and below material is the perfect material to use for food grade oil there's definitely businesses out there that use their top shelf for their food grade as well but if you're not super confident that the material that you've got or that you're working with is going to make a light golden kind of blonde hash robin it's great idea to just turn it into a food grade oil and then put that in a topical or edible excellent we've got a few a few cost questions here and I realize we're bumping up against the hour but any we can end with this one in general terms can you describe the difference in say overhead costs associated with starting with dried or cured product versus fresh frozen product all the equipment that might go into that and how it grow or how a how a manufacturer might keep keep those costs in mind yeah absolutely so it's just tough one to answer because every business has many businesses very different objectives about what their weekly throughput should be what kinds of SKUs and products they're trying to make out the other end um what you're going to find is that with fresh frozen you don't need as much space to do the drying and tearing and you don't need quite as much environmental control in that specific area of your lab because you're filling freezers full but what that does mean is that you have to understand you know what is the electricity requirements for you know drying and curing your material versus running a bunch of freezers you know every business is different and electricity prices are different all over the country some places are off the grid and they're full solar and it's not really much of an issue for them but most businesses don't fall into that category so overhead wise it's hard for me and I'm hesitant to say that well if you do fresh fruit when it's going to be a lot cheaper for you I promise I know that I cannot make that promise because it depends on your area but the vast majority of our customers and we work with labs all across the world many of the biggest solvus processors across North America who make literally be best concentrates in the entire world mmm the vast majority of them are doing fresh frozen and turning that into bubble hash and then making a variety of products as you know maybe their flagship solvent let's concentrate so I apologize for whoever was asking that if that was an exactly to your answer you're looking for but please contact us we would love to help you better understand what this equipment would look like in your operation we take a very hands-on each customer is different approach we'd be happy to run you through an equipment list and show you what things look like that's no cost no obligation we'd be happy to talk you through your needs excellent well yes I would echo that and recommend everyone jot down the contact information here and I'll also remind everyone that a link to this presentation will be hitting your email inboxes very soon here and Eric and everyone at pure pressure I will not thank you for the presentation today this has been really fantastic and really insightful okay hey thank you for having us I really appreciate it and great job moderating thank you so much and once again everyone for attending thank you and have a fantastic day", "xU1y9mX6jio": "here we go what's good YouTube welcome to another live stream can already take a few dabs and hang out it's just got done prepping for another hash wash damn it getting cold in here too because of that I might have to go grab my jacket but um yeah got the AC cranked to 62 degrees that the ice-cold water in the reservoir I've got a bag of ice for the washer and I've got six more bags ice out in the freezer I need to get a bigger freezer and all the materials well so later tonight after I get the kids down spend some time with the wife I'm gonna come back out here and knock out that bubble hash run uninterrupted probably gonna do somewhere between six to eight runs on it depending on how it looks and how everything is coming out [Music] anyways let's go ahead and get a - go in here I hope you guys are having a good day [Music] that was not clickbait by the way for those of you this joint this is a 104 grant or 100 Ford's a hundred grams now mixed strain hash frothing some cookies some sweet cream some zukie and what else sweet cream cookie sweet cream zoo keys and orange cookies that's what it is [Music] sorry I had someone from work pop-up I don't look out real quick [Music] all right cool [Music] anyways let's go ahead oh it's so good yeah I need to go ahead and fill up a little bit char with that [Music] this was some 60 micron parabola for edibles [Music] this one still has a cush cake in it and this one has on a fish cake so those that's my head - cooks cake in a jar [Music] earth is [ __ ] cold and her alright so I would like you yet in my day did you imagine dabbing that whole thing just like here we feel [ __ ] half the Banger ease and the easily I wouldn't even try it it'd be a waste and a half that's good enough for me enjoy that for the week [Music] the 160 press was man very little in there so that's what that looks like when I end up putting it in the jar and then a lot of people would ask me how did you get that [ __ ] rossington to stick to the bottom of the jar look so neat [Music] here's I take the glove and you're just going to push it down around the edges towards the center you're doing a cold room that's good rosin a clean glove and just like that now it looks like that [Music] with that's hard to see but yeah that's how that comes out when you end up doing that push it down it comes out real nice and clean looking perfect for grams or so it's upload a bird [Music] all right so I gotta move my dad station over now I'm not pressing it back over here well I like it Kiyo is : grab yeah you can do with parchment - I have a little bit more control with the glove I feel like and it rarely gets sticky but parchment works to a more sticky stuff I will use parchment I'm gonna go grab a hoodie real quick [Music] [Music] whoa [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] whoo my tears my eyes [Music] Oh [Music] oh man the big dads always get my nose my eyes [Music] Oh [Music] about three days away from the harvest yeah we're on day 54 honestly I think I could pull them down tomorrow or the next day I want it probably gonna go ahead and harvest them on Monday [Music] today's Thursday tomorrow's Friday yep I'm go ahead and harvest them on Monday [Music] five six out of the gate 58 [Music] [Music] I got some pictures of the plants I haven't even posted to Instagram yet pausing to share them with you guys real quick [Music] [Music] turn down the lights already this whole side is just [ __ ] Mileena should be up here these ones dried back a little bit too much almost too much but not too two months still prosti of [ __ ] 12 cars black out there my Spade going over there [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so that's the current status in the Guardian you know just like oh my flesh for usually you're about seven days it's that but you know [Music] I had issues this run just like Ross Leafs his issues because he's in cocoa they're harder to detect early and so he faced the consequences of the buffering that cal-mag provides in coma cocoa I wasn't in at nursery iam so I was able to turn my issues around a little bit faster but you know basically what I'm saying is you know I had issues this run and the crop is still coming out pretty good so next run you know those issues will be corrected I'll make a video covering the issues that I ran into this grow and how I plan to correct them and I'll throw it up on the patreon hopefully you guys can learn from some of my mistakes you know I talked about on the show doing your own research and shape one of the things I researched if I should have used top-down broward rivers and when I talked to mango tech Abadi he told me to use two gallons per hours to avoid clog and that's what each use is but then I ended up getting water channeling that is too fast on the float and I cost a lot of issues I never really fed high enough of an ECE to have the easy build up nor did I ever push the plants that hard to cause them to have any lockouts it was all because my irrigation was wrong from the get-go with the water swim [Music] are you taking off right now that's one of the changes I'm implementing is not only am I going to get rid of the 2 gallon per hour but I'm going to go all the way down to like a point 3 gallon per hour dripper that could eat drawstring and stuff up here so yeah that'll fix a lot of issues right off to that that I believe uh Charles and pastor [Music] that Daffy got me hired balls rolling in on me now [Music] oh my bad I look here looking up and showers my phone [Music] there's no broad my issues going on in here all it is is either a they were different cuts or they were microclimates right he talked about the water channeling so you know phosphorus deficiency can learn to purpling stems and the plants that express themselves differently also has purple stems where I was the ones that didn't have the red bugs didn't have purple stems so I think it was more of a microclimate issue water channeling issue causing different uptake different nutrients and it just got exacerbated due to the lockout because of the water channeling so next one I'm doing is with wedding cake and I should be getting those clones in about two weeks so I have about two weeks to prep get the plants chopped harvested and everything I'll flip them right in the room that they're in right now I'm basically going to push the tables to one side of the room and then I'll go in and use a light rail for this up against the wall and I'll cut down on the one plant out of time and hang it on a trellis hanging from the ceiling and then I'll just hang all the plants from one light all right [Music] when my moustache hairs on the know it wouldn't happen I got trim my mustache geez so yeah basically just go one light at a time right down hole lights worth of plants hang them go to the next one cut those down hang out on a different trailer that's there the next one so I'll have three trellis nets hanging on the side of the room I'll have to retry this netting on that side of the room so after I cut down the whole left side of the room and those plants are hanging up there on that left side I'm going to disassemble the tables and walk them out of the room and then I can push that whole other table completely over to the middle of the room hang up all those buttons on the back side of the room or wherever in the room right and then basically I'll be good to go I'll get everything hung I'll turn off the shaker fan I'll just keep one of them on probably maybe turn it down to low or something and I'll just have to DEET you and AC going in there I'll be able to scrub down the you the four by twelve that's in there now scrub it down and get it reset and start making my adjustments to the room while I wait on my new 4 by 12 American Girl products they're probably they told me it was going to be issued early June like June 8th or 6 but they might be able to get it in sooner so I mean worst case scenario the room will be down for about three weeks while I wait on the new table but I'll just match all the plants on one table while I'm doing that perfect and then when I get my new table in I'll be able to go ahead and transition the plants over throw up my trellis mats and pretty much switch so you know that's the plan and like I said I'll document all the changes to the room it said of everything that I'd be like want to document the changes and yeah my keeper fee no cuts from honest genetics should be here in the next two to three weeks and solved a whole room full of wedding cake in there veg and flour that while I have a child my keeper he knows from our genetics and my new keeper you know caked up cherries wedding cake crossed with cherry something f3 I'm going to do the three-tiered setup but I'm waiting on him to send me the updated invoice for the new poles and as soon as I get those I'll be able to set it up and I'll have pretty much what I was thinking of doing them what happened to rekey poofy nose and I could basically put all of them on their own tier if I wanted and then have clones next to it or I could just put all the moms on one and then since I'm doing two tables at a time I'll just pick you know I'll have two tiers for clothes you know cherry cookies have three thank you thank you thank you I never remember like my keeper he knows from honest I don't remember what I was are either blue hurricane 27 crossed with white sunrise for the blue lion keeper and then scarlet sure is chocolate frosting crossed with something I think [Music] I trust my man on his genetics he tells me yo this is a [ __ ] you should run for a hash let's fire fire fire legs all right now you got it [Music] like I remembered it enough to purchase it and you know that's all that matters now that's all that matters now I need to show up in the garden [Music] so stoked I have I'll have the blue Hawaiian which is gonna have exotic super crazy unique blue Terps it's gonna be highly sativa dominant as far as the high goes and then the truck not the truck cherry but the cakes of cherries that's gonna be my cherry Fino right there so I'll have a blue of a cherry and then I have the gassy out of scarlet shirt so it's gonna be dope [Music] this is real the kind of light that I use for clowns are right behind either the raging raging kales and I actually got sponsored by science LED yeah so I will be getting now raging candle LEDs probably twice a year during two biggest ways that I do and it couldn't be [ __ ] dope it can really know and then every other month or so I'll be giving away a bunch of science LED swag hats ashtrays shirts things like that all be put on there grower spotlight on their homepage pretty shortly here I have some pictures that I have to take for them and type up some some information and what else asked me to leave to help them do research spectrum tuning and hash production so I'll be doing that so and then also the big thing I'll be an authorized reseller for their lights on my webpage as soon as it's up in a few days so as soon as the page is up I'm going to try and get them on there and I'll be able to resell a life through my page so that way you know they don't do they don't do coupon codes like people in the industry you got to use to coupon codes because of for flex and all that but what that does is it makes it so that you can't sell that product in brick-and-mortar stores anymore and in the hydro industry almost need brick-and-mortar stores still surprisingly to you know expand and survive because still a big commercial facilities go through these hydro stores and you know direct to these manufacturers a lot so they don't do coupon codes they're like let's say they offer a 10% discount code here in California right and somebody purchases a light from you know from me and using my promo code but they're in Oregon or something and or somewhere else where they maybe don't charge sales tax and now not only are they getting the 10% off but they're also getting like seven or eight maybe taking even up to 10% off of that because of no sales tax right whereas if they were to purchase it in the store you know the store would be able to make a profit but in order to compete with that price that they would get you know from using the coupon code the brick-and-mortar store would basically have to not turn a profit so it doesn't work out for them to be able to give people who coupon codes stacked as representatives of the brand so instead I'll be able to be a reseller and then just a very very small portion of the profit that they would make from that light will go towards me instead so I'll be an authorized reseller and then basically helping do research and you know passing that information you guys like I have been this whole time so anyways this is what we're working with they bought this is delicious delicious it's called cookie dough and it's amazing [Music] I don't suspect this is gonna last long you won't need a code to let them know who sent you because you're gonna go through my website to purchase they're working on other programs like referral codes and things like that but [Music] yeah I guess I should keep this on camera so people don't think that I'm like lying and I say I got a grandfather drive here we did well today it's real I wouldn't had a couple more but honestly you guys want to get jars of the grape Cosby and literally all I have left of this [Music] that's it but in this drawer it's maybe maybe seven grams six seven grams of the grape Cosby I think the other jars been scraped empty already yeah scraped empty great cause be gone on that one and then the hell a Koosh cake [Music] there's like maybe two to three grams to scrape out of here [Music] and this one I think is scraped completely empty yeah there's maybe like point two in here it's empty so there was 70 72 grams of the La Push cake and 60 grams of the Cosby [Music] but every time you come in here you [ __ ] promotin be real oh no no no who was it last time it wasn't beaver oh it was your boy the other one that's not good Bernhard that's who it was last time [Music] about your ass sorry yo for real alright here's the funny story that's how you guys are quick so the reason this one got called rape Cosby because [Music] my wife and I dabbed it and she got so [ __ ] high off of it it was like she got roofied like straight roofie I could have done anything I wanted to so I was like mother kali shake great cosby it tastes like grapes and knocks you the [ __ ] out like you did this it was between grape Cosby and roofie colada you know think of work 12 but you guys got to make sure you do it right [Music] it's great cause be like that lowercase G Capital are [Music] all right let's get [Music] a little credit given to me I need a label hood [Music] it's

here it is and as this little my everybody [Music] alright I'll go ahead and get this uploaded to YouTube right you know [Music] I'm kind of done editing these I'm just gonna start uploading the RAW files and if people don't like it they can kiss my ass I don't have time to edit them together anymore that's why I put the PowerPoint how I did you know if I do the PowerPoint I don't have to worry about putting an intro and all that into the video it's just boom okay boss [Music] alright crap dude my science for plant nutrition are a cool description I'll edit that later now don't care playlist crafted science done no it's not made for kids don't have to restrict [Music] monetization please do [Music] public [Music] boom what is instant premiere oh [ __ ] we could watch it together at the same [ __ ] time let's [ __ ] do that right now I did not know we could do that that is really cool we can watch the video together yeah three minutes five all right it's 321 I'm gonna go in at 3:45

seconds that's called your video will premiere what's uploading and processing finished as well as the hundred percent uploaded is 95 percent process I have no idea how this is going to look for you guys I don't know how this works I've never done this before it is [ __ ] top-down so we're gonna check it out oh my god dollars people my DM right now [Music] all right you guys let me know what happens on your end when this is done hopefully I mean it doesn't take forever right now it's an remember you two processes videos one definition at a time so the low definition stuff is going to process and then like for whatever and then 720 and 1080 [Music] my phone right now it's just doing the load F [ __ ] the standard definition version we'll see whatever the [ __ ] back [Music] I'm really curious to see what this does though man that was such a good [ __ ] good [ __ ] episode and then episode 5 I'm glad we took a break because we were really [ __ ] burned out both of us and we needed a skip a week we came back and we didn't even have a PowerPoint or anything but it was still an amazing discussion Garrett jumped online from science at levy and he just [ __ ] to talk about what we wanted to talk about which was great just you know [Music] we just talked about troubleshooting it was [ __ ] awesome you know he get his perspective on things like walking into like a huge commercial facility and how you would troubleshoot their [ __ ] to figure out what's going on why certain part of the crop might not be doing its good versus another part things like that so it was really cool to get his perspective because you know as far as lost leaf goes he's a commercial facility but he's a one-man army and it's a small commercial facility it's the size of a house basically a one-story house and so and that's that's no diss whatsoever [ __ ] it's amazing what he's doing I wish I could be at his level but in the realm of commercial grows it's relatively small so you know his perspective is one and then Maya the home grower is another and then Gary brings a whole different perspective being that he's kind of more on the large large scale commercial and so it was really cool you know and go with it so unfortunately during this whole Cove 8:19 thing all of the HD recordings for webinars are being limited and only being allowed standard definition so this is not going to be best of qualities for the uploads that are going on right now from the webinars and there's nothing that we can do about that so you know [Music] check it on the patreon real quick make sure you guys got your post real quick [Music] are you guys waiting on me to take another dab is that what's going on [Music] I guess [Music] it's not what you guys I feel like a little [ __ ] a dab [ __ ] for you guys it's all you guys wanna take your dad show me his plan it's never hey SB Andy how's your day go what'd you do today need some help no I'm just [ __ ] one shot I already forgot what this one is again that's the coach tasted positive and he's more paper towels real quick cuz my house got so high I forgot to clean the [ __ ] banger after the last job that's [ __ ] I I guess I Cosby myself whoever said don't cause be yourself I can't be myself go clean it out real easy paper towels to clean [Laughter] [Music] yeah all of the rapidly science episodes go on patreon pretty much the same day or minimum a week earlier than YouTube a minimum and Matt doesn't post on lost leaf as a poster or anything like that out of respect for my patreon supporters he knows he waits again he's a week two to three weeks even suppose I mean it's not that I don't want the information out there for everybody but I wanted to I want to give some [ __ ] love to the people on patreon and economic access all that and they can pick my brain talk about it on live sessions or whatever brain different [ __ ] you know [Music] all right the tip of my II now is 395 and I need to grab another roll of paper towels real quick [Music] [Music] damn [ __ ] oh yeah [Music] oh [ __ ] [Music] in the filter [Music] oh Jesus son 525 that is a very very high [ __ ] gasps Jesus [Music] [Music] so the reclaim catcher works by basically a when you draw on the dab it gets stuck down here because all that reclaimed can't travel back up pretty much so what you end up with really is just tiny tiny pieces of the vapor that condensed back to rosin in here versus a shit-ton of replaying and if you have a really good deep-dish banger and you do low temp doubts your your reclaim actually can look really nice how well that looks but [Music] seeing us a thing FPV not everybody's email setup is the same not all coils are created equal so you got to get you know a good coil setup with this I can go three eighty and still get clouds [Music] you need some sort of cloud [Music] all right [Music] my emails from 7-10 coils and you have promo codes with them but up go my man go in the house [Music] did I even

around in 250 years [Music] [ __ ] [ __ ] that olive oil will get you bro oh alright you [ __ ] I'd have been dying for this dad for some reason or she dies or more yeah I got ahold of the giveaway winner and he commented all over my YouTube video and everything that following morning Jesus sweet baby Jesus my nose is already like crying thinking about these Turks [Music] Oh titanium is not 2008

catch you guys on the next one I'm gonna call it a night I had a bunch of other [ __ ] I gotta get around to these", "ab7DW9U61uc": "a marble cake yes today we're taking grocery store cakes and we're gonna see if i can turn it into a bomb looking marble cake so let's get started [Music] hey everyone welcome to kawaii pops oh look at my dancing my name is wesley snipes and today we're going to be making a marble cake now to start this cake off i am using a coconut cake i've never really liked coconut cakes but there was something about the way that the coconut was shimmering in the grocery store that i was like you know what you're gonna be the bottom layer of my wedding cake so i added some buttercream and i just started to smoothen out and straighten out the edges because the grocery store people don't know how to do that now i actually had to buy three more cakes for this wedding cake because the first cakes i bought were whipped cream based and they didn't stack well man it was so frustrating um so i bought three more five dollar icing based cakes i was really inspired by the middle layer of this which i think is a st patrick's day cake that's why it's green but it made me think of mint and so i created this dark chocolate ganache it wasn't super sweet and so it wasn't overwhelming after that it was time to start marbling our cake so i thought it'd be really classy if the bottom layer was darker than the top layer i don't know why i thought that was classy but i was right it is very classy so we've got this nice gray marble going onto the bottom and because i don't do wedding cakes like very often except for when i'm doing this challenge i try like extra hard to make sure that the sides are nice and crisp i just take my fondant smoother and just continuously work those edges and eventually they get as crisp as i want them to be now for the tops here i thought that it would be too hard to cover this cake the same way that i did the bottom because it's so tall so i decided to just panel the fondant on the sides and just blend the top with some white buttercream now we got some dowels going in oh and you can see the roses that i'm gonna use behind me oh they're so pretty you guys i'm stacking my second tier just like that and i'm gonna add a little bit more glamour to this we got some gold luster dust i'm gonna try to make it seem like it's a part of the marble oh my gosh it looks so luscious look at that now these flowers you guys they're like dying the edges of these flowers are welted but i chose them because i thought that looked really antique and classy i thought they would add like this very old-timey look to my cake and i was right it looks very old-timey voila my marble cake was complete what do you think do you like it yes work those poses highlight your cake boy you did a good job cutting into this cake oh look at that look at that green icing comes out nowhere oh but i got to tell you this mint ganache was so good usually i only have one piece of cake i had two pieces of this cake because i just i just loved it now i need your help i want you to choose the next style of wedding cake for my next grocery store cake challenge and i'm thinking it should be a black wedding cake because i don't really see too many of those but you know that would be kind of spectacular i hope you guys enjoyed this i love you i will see you very soon bye you", "ubx_A3NmzNM": "Bammer TV welcome back to Bamber TV weed reviews where we review the best strains around today we have another really awesome hybrid it known as wedding cake so can't wait to talk about that today but if you guys want to check out some of our other weed reviews we do have a playlist with all of our reviews and you can find that in the description and on the screen right now Dave I got to ask you though wedding cake so wedding cake is also known as pink cookies and it is a cross between cherry pie and Girl Scout cookie and it's known for having a sweet aroma and having a very nice flavor profile with some peppery and piney notes in there as well it's also remarkably high in THC testing in the high 20s very consistently alright and right away wedding cake is exactly what I look for in weeds it's very dense so when you grind it up you're gonna be surprised on the yield the smell is also very sweet-smelling but not none of the berry notes that you would find in other sweet strains wedding cake for me is just something that I love smoking and for Dave and I we actually chose a steamroller so steam roller kind of a cross between a bong in a bowl and definitely gives you that giant hit and very flavorful as well to go along with the amazing flavor and aroma of this weed it is remarkably medicinal it's fantastic if you have stress and depression and if you need a little bit of mood enhancement in your day this is gonna be the strain for you all right Dave so a strain that is both dense flavorful the aroma is there I'm assuming this is gonna be on the higher end of the spectrum but Dave I gotta ask you today Bama rating for wedding cake we really hit all the high points on this weed I really enjoy the fact that it doesn't give you too much cottonmouth and it really doesn't make your eyes too dry and all of that in company together with the flavor and the density I really have to give this a 4.5 out of 5 which makes it tied for first place on our channel alright guys so there you go if you're looking for a flavorful hybrid I think wedding cake is a pretty good choice from us guys if you want to check out some of our other reviews we do have a we'd review playlist on the description let us know how we're doing here on Bammer TV and for everything else weed and weed related keep it here on Bammer TV [Music]", "1nDQEqUiV_o": "[Music] hello and welcome back to the cannabis sommelier i'm your host andrew friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of cannabis reviews today we have an awesome product category it's extracts i've only had one extract on the channel i personally love extracts it's mainly what i smoke it's what i'm used to vaporizing from the legacy market something that i hold near and dear to my heart and i'm actually going to show you my live rosin and hash rosin in a coming video from my garden you get to see some of the things that i've made and some of the cannabis i produce and kind of see how i'm holding people accountable to my standard but what do we have today a really cool product uh from an awesome company out on vancouver island from good buds we've got hash rosin and you might be asking yourself andy what's hash rosin well let's take both the words break them down hash being uh seething the glandular head off of cannabis either through a dry sieve or a wet sieve being bubble hash or dry sip i believe this one comes to us from a fresh frozen bubble hash because that's what they have on market right now and what their product card is saying now rosin if you're not familiar with the terminology rosin it's actually the way you can excrete the essential oils from the cannabis flower or hash by only using heat or pressure and then you squish out those essential oils and you leave behind any contaminant that may be there giving you a beautiful dabbable product there isn't very many uh products to dab on market right now so that's why i was excited to see the good buds hash rosin come out and at a reasonable price point this is a half gram and the half gram is 40 that's what i paid for it so not too bad now i see this it was packed on may 6 2020 uh net weight half gram and it's equivalent to two grams of dried canvas not bad at all the smoke from cannabis is harmful there are 800 milligrams of active thc in a full gram of this so 400 milligrams a lot of thc a lot of terps uh all the good things that you're looking for if you are have found that you've built a big tolerance to cannabis and you've never tried an extract before like rawson shatter live resin or even just hash i definitely would recommend uh supercharging everything up you can use these products in different ways today i'm gonna use them in a dab rig because that's the best way for me to assess the flavor but enough talking about it well i think i mentioned good buds is certified organic which is cool uh good buds this is from sun grown cannabis and the company was started out the back of a sprinter van i believe uh growing cannabis and evolved into an entire licensed producer so good for the guys out there for having the business acumen to bring something like this to market and be one of the first movers pretty cool in my opinion i don't know who processed it for them but if i was to make a bet on it i think it was whistler tech here we go let's break the seal underneath this camera and we've got this big package see our cannabis seal all of our good stuff let's get in there hope you're having a wonderful day oh can i get in with my just my thumbnail there we go and then it should be a easy peasy lemon squeezy and there is what's inside of our package which is another child proof container and there is our rosin let's inspect our container no contaminant doesn't look like there's any contaminant it's a little dark but we're not raws and racist here so we're gonna try it it definitely has that crust formed on the top it's been sitting packaged for a couple months now so that's fair um but let's dig in and then we'll start smelling it very soft you can see there buttered underneath that color goes all the way through i kind of like to break this out of here but let's smell it so this is a mixed hash they say that it's a bunch of mixed ones but i know they have lord of the apes and white glucky so i assume it's a mix of those two um on the nose there's like lemon lemon bar a little bit of lemon cream yeah definitely just those confectionary kind of cakey lemon bar aromas creamy sweet cream lemon it's quite simple that's all i'm really pulling out of it at first i had a bit of an aroma skunk but that skunkiness is gone let's see if i can pull this out of there there we go we can get it out pretty easy and uh we can get a little booty shot of our grain or our half gram here so you can see how it waxed up in there you can see the sheen on now that's been opened it's sweating a little so that's pretty cool uh oh no stuck to my finger okay so now most importantly let's taste it uh if you guys aren't used to doing dabs it's a little bit of a process there are more things you are going to need a rig now there's many different options you can use an electronic rig like the g pen rom that heats up and it's you know click of a button it all turns on i have reviews of that um or you can use the traditional rig banger and a torch with a carb cap today i think i'm going to do that since this is hash rosin i want to give it the respect i'm going to put the respect on it um so let's give that a little taste test out of my elbow dyno 2014 very cool check out elbow glass this is one of his original shapes um always wanted this piece very very cool i am using i forget what kind of banger this is and then there's a ruby insert in here we're gonna use the gordo scientific cap this is a blazer big shot torch in case all those things matter to you there's a lot of pieces to this dabbing thing but again as i mentioned vaporizing essential oils is what i uh tend to do the most it's the most time consuming but it's like smoking an entire joint in one puff and that's pretty all right if you ask me so there we go got it hot enough and now we're gonna wait a minute good thing i have a timer up here or else i would completely lose this we'll put that little guy into that bottom shot while we wait for it here well let's do it up here the dino just cooling down super cool love this piece absolutely love this piece um i was really happy actually me and my wife bought it together and we got hooked up through homeless hittings at homeless headies on instagram you should definitely check out homeless headaches if you're looking to get yourself a sick rig at a great price all right that's about our dab temperature and uh cheers okay so pretty good um things that i often look for in a hash rosin uh are that it has no plant matter taste um there wasn't any plant matter taste so that is a good sign and then the motto is there's always going to be a little bit of residual in the banger so you got to waste it to taste it but we're going to want to wipe out what's left over to keep our banger nice and clear we can really get a lot of indications off of the q-tip as well see if there's any contaminant anything like that and to me it uh it melted pretty clean actually um so pretty pretty good um what did i taste though i did try their white glooky's hash and i could taste that kind of wood chippiness come through from um that hash so maybe that's one thing i did take a decent size dab so i was really trying to taste it on the palate i got um i guess a little bit that lemon bar a little bit that sweet cream i definitely got wood chips i tasted a lot of like older hash that maybe had been quite oxidized but the finish is nice and long on my palette not bad at all i think it's a good representation of where the legal market can start and what we can evolve too i think it's probably competing with a lot of things on that legacy market right now maybe not the top top end um but it's not uh it's it's it's not too bad um okay well let's break down the good buds hash rosin from top to bottom how we liked it uh so the appearance it is hash rosin uh we're not rosin racist but i would like a much lighter creamier um more stable less sweaty as soon as i open it product there are a lot of things that uh this could go through to give it a different formulation so on the appearance i guess there's no contaminant the color's rough um we'll give it 15 points i think 15 points is fair for the appearance this is definitely maybe just a year behind where it could be um the smell wasn't too loud as i mentioned it is a simple rosin it had that sweet cream lemon bar kind of buttery lemon bar i don't know not anything insane again 30 points done the taste was good the finish is definitely the best part but when i did get that little bit of wood chippiness that didn't get me too stoked it would just kind of tasted like old hash um just being an absolute hash head i knew what i was tasting um so in that case for the taste i'd like to give it 13 points could have done better didn't taste bad had a nice finish um but the pieces of it that stood out to me i could kind of feel like it might have been i don't want to say faulted but i could i could tell that it wasn't um what it could have been uh overall experience based on my knowledge of cannabis rosin everything about this um it's like a 70 product so let's give it 14 points and that's my total i bet it's about a 70 percent uh hash rosin um ways to go good starting point not overly upset at my purchase for forty dollars and let's play with it once before we go in the camera so you guys can see the butter butter see the sweat mixing up but it is quite sticky and let's give it one last smell no nothing's changed just sweet cream and lemon awesome thanks so much for watching i hope you're gonna dab some extracts i hope you're out there i hope you're gonna move into that new world have you ever dabbed before let me know below let me know if i need to do a dab tutorial or something like that and cover it a little bit more in depth i really appreciate you watching have a great day make sure to like comment share and subscribe cheers guys what's my name what's my name the cannabis somalian", "QAkbtBShyp0": "hey everyone how's it going Eric here with peer pressure we're gonna be showing you our top five tips and tricks for getting the most out of your flower rosin so whether you're pressing at home on a hair straightener or using an industry-leading press like our peg speak rosin press we've got all the tips and tricks so you can get the most out of it tip number one quality in quality out this is the most important thing that you should know when you're making flower rosin or any rosin the better the material you're starting with the better your results are going to be and the fresher it is the better the clarity as material tends to age it's gonna oxidize and you're gonna find that that rosin is gonna come out darker so if you're looking to make the best flower rods and you possibly can get stellar material and press it as soon after its dried and cured as possible tip number two relative humidity makes a huge difference with flower rosin now you can go check out our other video where we did the full in-depth test but what you need to know is that your flower should be at least at 55 to 62% humidity before you press it this makes a massive difference in your yield so just make sure that your material is properly hydrated before you press it tip number three choose your temperature based on your desired results so we encourage a lot of experimentation and you're gonna find that most people are either pressing on the lower temperature range which is about 160 to 190 degrees Fahrenheit or the higher temperature range which is anything from 190 to as high as 250 degrees so depending on what kind of consistency you want to achieve that's where you're gonna set your temperature on the lower range you're gonna be looking at more of a butter on the higher range more of an oil or a shatter so when you have some material that you're playing around with we encourage you to try both ends of the spectrum and see which one you like the most tip number 4 choose the right micron bag type now you can absolutely press flower outside of a bag and get great results but that's usually only a gram or two you're gonna want to press in a 90 or 115 micron bag or at the most 150 we recommend not going any lower than 90 because that's when you're gonna see a huge drop-off in yield so if you're pressing flour in a bag make sure to stick in that range and finally tip number five if you're looking to make the highest quality flour on possible you absolutely don't need to overdo it on the pressure now you can definitely over press your flour rosin by applying way too much force at your bag and in fact we've seen great results not only with yield but of course with quality pressing at the lower end of the pressure range anything from around 550 to 1600 psi at the bag so when you're applying way too much pressure in the many thousands what can often happen is that you're pushing out plant fats lipids you know the waxes as well as all of those undesirable plant materials into the rosin really over pressing it so if you're looking for the highest quality rosin we recommend trying the lower pressure range and seeing your results

this is what I got it from harvest health dispensaries Tulsa Oklahoma Tulsa yowzers its most I mean if you're if you ever had wedding cake I mean it smells it smells like wedding cake it just has that distinct smell like know this legit for sure well it's crystals I mean it just smells so dank all right put this in my bowl try this try this out see where she got a taste I told me it says this is like 28 percent or 30 no no what do you say 32 percent the percentage is not on but when I was there he says it's like 32 percent we go and see we go and see it smells bombed Oh sing a little bit man primo primo super strong definitely taste our bomb there are two percent definitely in the high twenties it tastes so good look I said I got an eighth of it cost me 35 bucks because what I got from man that's it man you guys take it easy cheering music [Music]", "SM12-6QEfLI": "what's up everybody we're here in the smash lab and today we're gonna be making some very very strong THC oil using 17 different rosin pucks [Music] the thing about these rosin pucks is they are still loaded with THC we haven't been pressing super high pressure lately we've been doing around 650 to 700 so there is a lot of rosin left over in these the great thing is we've got a new teach egg tester so we're gonna find out just how many milligrams is left inside this oil at the end the last video you saw when our boss drank that entire thing he was completely loaded we are gonna find out just how many milligrams that was and we anticipate this one's gonna be a lot stronger so stay tuned to see just what the measurement comes out to we'll start by getting a little bit of coconut oil 60 milliliters and our beaker over there and warm that up to about 140 degrees for 5 minutes alright so there's our 60 milliliters what we're gonna do is add it to this larger beaker because we're gonna be putting the pucks inside here we need a little bit more space [Music] all right so we're gonna let that heat up for a few minutes it's at about 170 degrees right now okay so our oil is now at around 125 degrees we're gonna go ahead and start adding our pucks like I said we have 17 bucks right here if you want to take a look at these you can see these things are cake this thing has got a nice yellow color still kind of sticky smells great wish you guys could smell this we're gonna start by adding 2 at a time try to save a little time here so I'll take these two right here take a look at these I want you to see what they look like before and after they're gonna be a lot more clear and that oil is gonna be bright yellow by the time I'm done with these two so let's go ahead and have these in there make sure they're fully submerged and boom as you can see we can easily add two at a time in here as we lose a little bit of oil we might have to drop down to one at a time so this all depends on how much oil you're using [Music] all right so it's been about five minutes we're gonna go ahead and take a look at these pugs make sure we got all the rosin outside of them it was about five minutes and we're doing two at a time it's important to know that you can even do seven to ten minutes depending on how your puffs look after we're gonna take a look right now you can see that the oil is already a completely different color than it was originally so these do look pretty clear we'll probably go ahead and let those sit for about two more minutes make sure we get everything out and then we'll completely remove them [Music] okay so it's been two more minutes let's go ahead and remove these our first one here as you can see that was a lot more clear take a look at our oil here it's got a nice yellow color it was originally clear so we're gonna do is go ahead and squeeze the rest of the oil out of these pucks here okay so our first two pucks got them right here as you can see those things are really clear we pulled a lot of rosin out of those here's a one we haven't done yet next one we have done as you can see there's a lot of rosin inside of these puck still what we're gonna do is bill the other 15 bucks in there on a time lapse to save you guys time and go ahead and see how this oil tests out at the end okay so that was the last puck we just did all 17 as you can see these are completely clear now we pulled all the rosin out of those as you can see the oil is way dark way darker than last time we assume is gonna be very potent we're gonna go ahead and test it out but first we've got Adi carbon so let's get that last puck out of there [Music] okay so we just removed that last puck and we turned the temperature up a little bit on our hot plate we're trying to get around that 220 to 240 degrees range we're gonna let that boil sit there for about 10 minutes so we can de carve this is gonna activate all the THC that's inside that oil this should take about 10 minutes but we're gonna pay attention to the bubbles that are forming as you see those bubbles that means it's d carving and once those disappear you're pretty much good to go [Music] okay so next we're going to do is take a nug Smasher 37 micron bag and strain the oil through it what that's going to do is get rid of any of that plant material was left over [Music] all right so what were left with is 20 milliliters of completely activated THC oil what we're gonna do is use our new teach egg test machine a lot of you have been recommending this to us you really want to know how many milligrams of THC was in a in the oil when we were done what this does is it uses light to analyze the oil and give us the total cannabinoid count we know that flour that we pressed was predominantly THC however if you were doing heme it would give you the CBD results as well the only thing is it only tests up to 15 milligrams of THC or total cannabinoids per milliliter so we're gonna have to dilute our rosin oil right here in a twenty to one ratio with coconut oil so we'll do that now all right so let's get our scale zeroed we're gonna add a point 400 grams of clean coconut oil right here alright next we're gonna add point O two of our rosin oil [Music] turn this on alright so we're testing isolate infusion we're doing coconut oil temperatures about 75 and the infusion has been deep carbs we're going to go ahead and begin the test first we got to ensure the tray slot is empty which it is okay let's just calibrate yeah and while that's calibrated we can go ahead and add our oil to the tray right here [Music] all right all right we got the results ten point six times twenty so two hundred the point six times two would be [Music] so two hundred and twelve per milliliter and how many do we have twenty Destin that's that's a lot for one person to drink that's pretty heavy all right so extremely potent oil right here we just got this tea check yesterday we've been playing with it for the past two days really cool device we were really interested to see how many milligrams this was 4240 that's a lot more than most people would do in one dose like we did last time thanks for watching the video and make sure you stay tuned for next time hey guys make sure you

sciences on the show their ceo and co-founder matt blum will be joining us here shortly looks like he's already here forget quick matt uh thanks everyone for tuning in just starting this up so i kind of say the same stuff over and over at the beginning what's up matt what's going on my dude hey looks like you're in a pretty cool spot how's your day uh it's going well listen i'm i'm gonna grow how bad could it really be not too bad at all well thank you for taking some time to join me today i'm gonna say this probably five times throughout the episode here uh got matt here with grow sciences on the show if you've got some questions pop them in the question box at the bottom and i'll sprinkle those in uh but we've been talking with growth sciences for a long time matt just for everyone who's on the show here why don't you give us a little introduction about yourself uh and grow sciences your business sure uh thanks for doing this uh stream with us yeah and sorry my head is is bad i got a bad head so uh hopefully it's fine you're a much better head than i do yeah i don't know about that but that's okay so uh yeah my name is matthew blum i'm one of the uh co-founders here at grow sciences along with my partner uh mike and john uh founded our company in may of 2017. um it's been the ride of a lifetime and i'm pretty blessed to work with the greatest team on the planet and come to this place every day living my dream uh i started growing in 1997. um so it's uh almost 25 years i cut my teeth in northern california and santa rosa southern california arizona built out a couple facilities in colorado arizona cali wow um just kind of doing my thing in cannabis been through the raids been through uh the good the bad the ugly and uh still here you know i'm still here and it's it's been a hell of a ride and uh you guys have been uh a huge help for us the past couple years as we've uh gotten into the solventless game and you know we're all about producing the best clean products we can you know our mantra is patient over everything quality over everything um transparency and that's about it i mean uh we're definitely not the best looking people so uh we gotta go on quality at that point of time don't beat yourself up too much man it looks like you're in a pretty good looking room before we dive into some questions here getting a lot of love in the comments uh sounds like you guys have a nice following people are stoked on your products uh what's going on in the grow room that you're in right now this is the first time anyone's brought it there so nice work okay well i gotta tell you man i know there i i know the term is follower that's that's right but this is our family no like you know when we jumped into the game in arizona it was a race to the bottom there really wasn't a lot of quality in arizona and uh with this family which is on this live stream with us right now some of them they've kind of changed it all and it's all theirs this belongs to them not us there's not a day that goes by i'm not thinking about them mike's not thinking about them and every person in this building isn't thinking about them um we are nothing without them and i was nothing before them and if they were to leave i'd be nothing without them so uh it's uh we're here and i've got one goal at grow sciences produce the best highest quality clean cannabis whether we do it in a greenhouse and we address a lower price quality tier whether we do it on the top shelf tier it's quality above everything and you know in arizona right now there's a lot of stuff going on because we're in a drought and no one can get weed and it's just all bad right now and this is all happening during kobit which who knew this [ __ ] was coming you know like right who knew this [ __ ] was coming and it's just times are really bad for people um i wish i could do more i you know i'm not that smart a guy that's the problem so you know we're doing what we can here at uh at gs um i can take you and show you a little bit of this room i i think i can flip the camera yeah yeah please i mean uh love to mix it up show us what you guys got growing sorry i'm not the best technology guy bear with me hey no that's okay even if it's not working out too well if it won't let you flip okay oh there you go let me move this lens over though because i got this really cool lens from method seven okay oh there we go so uh let me actually walk to the front of the room this is one of our 40 light rooms okay and we'll kind of do a an over overview here so this is what our 40 light rooms look like uh we are in week six here we've got uh in front of us here is some runts and this will be our second run with it and let's see if i can yeah it's hard to get the focus just right but i can tell they're nice and frosty and people were even shouting out the runts uh in the comments right when you started uh your explanation so clearly this is a strain that people are excited about what's the lineage on runs do you know it's a skittles and gelato um frankly with all these gelato crosses they're all basically gelato right you know but it's we wanted to bring the genetics to arizona and other people are running it here too um someone else just brought up potent planet in the comments they're badasses they're another company down in tucson bringing mad quality to arizona um and there's other operators here doing it doing it too it's really good stuff so uh arizona's coming up man people people think it's all cali in colorado let me assure you there's fire in az um this is some apple fritter right here um she throws basically the the biggest nugs i've ever seen yeah those coals are huge man it's unreal like it's bigger than blue dream and we don't we don't grow blue dream here but i certainly have contents with it right but yeah the bd bad word you know well it is because it you know it gets overplayed and you know what are you gonna do uh so there's a little bit more apple fritter and then we got some of the alien labs cut of dosie does and some wedding cake so uh you know that's this room here we're week six um looking really good you know people always say [ __ ] blue dream but it's like it's the most bought wheat i think so someone's buying it i don't know who it is i i know if you're if you're a real head then you say you like blue dream you might get disowned by the community but for the people out there who are business owners such as yourself and there's a lot of people out there that actually enjoy it and i'll even admit that i've had a cut or two of blue dream that was certainly pretty good it's just a touchy topic i think uh yeah i think it brings a lot of opinions up but it looks like you guys have a nice really modern lineup of uh genetics in this room do you guys have a couple of these rooms yep so we have 40 light rooms we've got a 24 light room and then i've got four 16 light rooms and uh i can take you through i mean um you know i can take you through all of them everything everything's in different stages here we can only harvest one room a week i've only got nine trimmers we hand trim here so you know that's what we're able to accomplish and um the room next door to this is uh cushman's mac and skittles um nice and the room to the other side of it you know we got chem dog and then you know everything's in different stages so uh you know we will uh i'll show you whatever man we're always down to do that you know sure yeah i know you're holding your camera too so if you get to a point where walking around is easier just make sure you're close to some wi-fi so uh we can we can keep up the stream but you know this this is a great way for me to ask maybe one of my first big questions is you know we're talking about genetics here do you guys shop around for genetics specifically for solvent lists what is your process for where your growers decide what you're gonna grow sure um so i run the cultivation um i have a cultivation manager and then there's about eight other cultivators here um they do all the real work um i'm a nothing um i basically laid out the plan feed you know i built the rooms um i walk them multiple times a day but the hard work is being done by the cultivation team obviously and uh you know the de-leafing the training the [ __ ] that makes equality is done by them um but yeah i'm in it all day every day and uh i can't imagine not being and you know my partner mike runs the executive side and uh you know the rest is history i like kind of developing new products and you know just all that stuff you know i like to work on the rosin cartridge that took us about 10 months to get going um yeah it's it's everything so i want to get into uh some solventless edibles stuff like that and it's all about building a bench and how do we do it with genetics i basically leverage the relationships i've had for 20 plus years to get clones but we'll spend upwards of about five thousand dollars a month on seeds wow yep we do massive pheno hunts uh we're about to feno hunt about 400 seeds spanning 28 different cultivars uh majority for rosin so majority for rosin um hey there's potent planet in there right now those guys i was talking about those don't ignore this dread pirate guy though he's one of those genius extractors but he's an [ __ ] a lot of personalities in here so one of the comments that we just got that i would like to dig into a little bit more is you know why do you choose the strains that you choose you know what are you guys looking for a diverse flavor profile across your strains are you looking for something specific in each one i mean how why do you do the strain selection and what are you going for so it actually so three years ago i would have answered that question with quality doesn't matter otherwise now i have to solve like five different things which are number one it has to be of the highest quality number two it has to yield at least a certain amount do i need to hit three a light on everything no but i can't hit one and a half right that's just not gonna work um it has to look good in our jar but here's one of the biggest things that i never hear people talk about with commercial it has to trim well i do not want to deal with my trim crew when i hand them flower they don't like trimming it's it's just [ __ ] bad it's real bad i mean they tell you and so it has to trim well you got to hit like five different metrics for it to be a winner here so you know i loved the meat breath we had a cut of meat breath we pheno hunted i loved it but you know it didn't yield for [ __ ] for us and because they didn't like trimming it and that was the end of the meat breath plus potent rocks the meat breath they grew it better than we did anyway and uh you know they're killing it so um you know it all goes into it though so like take runs right so we just did our first run with runs um we're actually about to start curing it and we've done the live rosin press from it so we only yield it on the hash side to some odd percent okay so definitely not even break even yep at two percent i'm not going to be able to run that strain uh that genetic for uh live rosin outside of the lowers so i can take the lowers and i could do live rosin out of that um but we're not going to do whole plant there's just no way whereas right next to the runts in that room was our willy's cush cake which was a sea junkie genetic ran at almost six percent hash that's great you know those are great numbers 83 on the rosin conversion that's a great number um and frankly you know that's what you're looking for is above 80 percent on the rosin conversion and really above four and a half percent on the hash side yeah and we'll still do stuff that's less like the skittles for us doesn't really yield more than two to a half percent but i love it that's all i'm sure the people love it [ __ ] turf profile is what i'm all about when you open up the little jar of it it just hits you in the face so i like it and because i own the joint i get to run some of those yeah so you can you can make some executive decisions on some of your favorite strains that make it through to the live rosin that's it you know and yeah we don't get to run a ton of it because you know i'm not going to tank our books because you know it is a business and and we have to do well here i've got big aspirations to just experience to make you know okay so you know how microsoft minted all those millionaire secretaries do you remember that story i don't know if i'm a lot older than you are yeah i am vaguely aware of that story actually yes you know they minted all these the original people that were microsoft whether they were secretaries or not all became millionaires if they did the stock you know i want to mint the first millionaire trimmers so i want everybody who's at this company to [ __ ] murder it like i want when this day comes like however long i'm in this for you know i want everyone to come with me and you know so i like paying for everyone's health care you know i like that stuff i i like getting food for the team all the time i like i don't know i just i wanted to have a certain quality of life and it is so we do have to run it as a business um we just have to do it the right way and be transparent that's all like owning all our [ __ ] because let's be real this company you know if it's being led by me it's being led by one of the biggest [ __ ] ups on the planet and the good part about me is that i know i'm gonna make a lot of mistakes and hopefully we we figure it out but this family you know we have to do another one of these streams where i just put them on it because you guys never get to talk to them and that's the story the story is the team that works they are just i don't know man i don't i don't know i just don't have words they're they're uh they're better than me you know and that's how it should be so uh i'm good with that you know well let me take your thought one step further and this is something that you know we spend we've spent most of our time on our solvent-less hash q and a's talking with cash makers who are also business owners but i think a lot of people in here would love to get some more perspectives you know from you as a business owner creating company cultures that are positive that people want to work in that is not a common experience for a lot of people in the cannabis industry there's a lot of turnover there's a lot of vicious you know business owners that only care about their bottom line and what you're telling me is that you know you guys take a different approach so you know is that you know the quality of the company quality of the product all tied together that's all part of your ethos right so here's the deal man we all in this planet love making money listen i love high-end alcohol you know i'm kind of a drunk in that regard like don julio 1942 you know all that stuff like i live for that so and i love food you know i love i love food too so drugs alcohol and food it's not cheap um so yeah we care about the bottom line but let me just tell you this is not a company that that nickels and dimes we could be making a lot more money um but it was the quality of life and i stand by that 100 and i'm going to stand by it until my last breath as the owner of this company um and these these family members if you meet them and i and i don't just meet like the employees here but it's like our patients you know we're not a rec state yet so for us as patients i'll call them i'll call them customers when we go wreck but they're in this with us they they know there's more to this i i really hope they do i feel like when i'm out there talking to them you know i've had the honor of getting to butt tent at a local dispensary here a couple of fridays just to you know kind of talk to people directly yeah i know there's more to this like they know that every state's gonna make a decision at some point in their wreck market and it's going to be am i going with the big corporate or am i going with the small corporate and let's be real we are a small corporate like yep there's 40 people you're not mom and pop anymore yeah man i mean i've got 340 likes we're outputting 400 pounds a month you know it makes me act better it's better for the people here but you're gonna have to make a decision in all these wreck markets like who are we going with and you know it's it's what it is and someone just said true med on the stream [ __ ] yeah true men man those are my guys i i love them to death i talk to them almost daily um true med is in the hall of fame and we're [ __ ] so lucky to have them in arizona um it's it's that simple we're lucky to have true infusion we're lucky that potent planet we're lucky to have nectar farms like you know enough of this it's only cali man like az's got it and why people think less of a z cannabis has a lot to do with packaging and it's something that no one out there for whatever reason is talking about and if you get cannabis directly from my building like if i know you or you know we get cannabis from the building like i put it through a normal patient allocation or whatever i have to do it is a different experience than when you buy it at a store you know it gets jarred we seal it in our custom jar then it goes dispensary then it gets sold it's not the same everybody in the industry everybody in the industry whether it's jungle boys alien labs i've spent tens of thousands of dollars traveling between colorado arizona california washington yeah and it's everywhere right so marijuana is meant to be packaged in a ziploc bag from your dealer's turkey bag and hand it off to you 24 hours later yep we're not able to do that um so we're going to do the best we can with what we've got yeah and it's dry out there too right i mean it's dry in colorado it's super dry down there even more so that's it you know that's it so um we're gonna do our best we're gonna try and continue to do the best and all that stuff so you know mike and i my partner and i actually invested in a packaging company to try and figure out our jar and i know 710 just came out with a vacuum sealed jar we have a vacuum steel jar and it's it's got to go uh it's we got to go further we're on the first iteration um but we're still here so uh we're gonna acquire some greenhouses soon because i want to address that 25 30 8 with clean cannabis and i hope arizona chooses to stay with gs like i hope they know that that we're with them no question about it because this [ __ ] keeps me up at night you know when i'm responding to the dms at 2am in the morning or when i'm on reddit and and y'all are giving me heartburn from the crazy [ __ ] you're saying or you know whatever it is like you know i'm here and you know let me know how i can make it better for you guys i'm [ __ ] that's it that's all i care about so let me let me throw uh a little softball your way we had someone ask this or comment this at the very beginning tell the people about your stimulus efforts that was a legendary commitment to the az community tell me about that what is what happened there what does that even mean um well let's just spend a little bit of time on it i'm not really big on talking about the stimulus okay when times were really shitty when covet first hit we decided to give away as much weed as we could i think we helped out some people for a very small amount of time it's something that i feel has to become a permanent part of our operation i don't know how that's gonna look um i think it helped out a little bit uh okay and just trying to get back to the community that's it man and and it's it but you know i'm not big on uh stimulus is over we did it and and let's move on let's move on to the next one it's an honor to serve the people of arizona that's that's how i feel about it okay let me throw another one at you then about growing what's the best week to start training plants cultivar specific for me so for rogs we just send them straight up for the most part um you know we'll put about 140 of them in a row which is about 16 a light and you don't have to do a lot of training with that uh with a plant like the runts we'll start uh week one probably day six or seven and then we'll train through day twenty um we'll do some minor defoliation but basically goal being phil every square of your uh canopy and we operate in a four by four area um that's how we rate everything is by four by four and that's it and we have high numbers we need to hit here you know we're sure we're shooting for 2.75 a light we've never averaged that unfortunately but we do shoot for it we get close uh but we're always dialing in the tech and that's great but to answer that question day one through 20 you're always you're training your plants out because by day 21 unless you're rocking like a gmo it's pretty much set in stone what you're going to be looking like as a plant at that point you know you're you're defolding along the way to open up sites to make sure the light comes in but at that point it's more about you know moving water throughout the plant it's it's not so much about blood structure okay i got you that's great and i mean honestly it sounds like your acumen when it comes to growing is probably so much bigger than most people would guess because there's a lot of people who run or own cannabis businesses that they don't get in the grow that much they're just more looking at spreadsheets and they're on their computer so you know for people who are on here that are trying to run their own businesses or thinking about doing it like what's the best advice you could give to new cannabis business owners who are interested in getting into the market you know whether it's in arizona or anywhere else sure sure um so first and foremost my ass does do a lot of spreadsheeting so i haven't had a lot okay you know doing production schedule and data analysis and stuff i never thought i'd see myself doing um so i am lame in that regard and it's not lame that's how you run a business the right way you know you gotta know excel sorry guys for everyone who's tuning in that's the that's the hard that's the hard truth is uh if you want to run a business learn excel can i tell you what my advice is to anyone trying to get in because there's still time to get in the capital markets have dried up unfortunately because of med men and these [ __ ] msos which i'm sure my partner is going to yell at me when he hears me say that you know the money's gone no one wants to put equity investments in because you know because it got [ __ ] up right i mean it's just all bad out there i mean what was the one yesterday bilzerian blew 50 mil of other people's cash you know i mean on cbd products that are basically nowhere you know it's like how on earth do you you [ __ ] i mean it just i don't know man that just makes me nauseous so um you know what are you gonna do though but uh this is my advice find your passion whatever the hell it is i don't care if you want to be a garbage man be the absolute best garbage man and i promise you you'll make good money because the people who make money are the ones that are the best at what they do it's they're the best at what they do because they love doing it and it's not a job you know i love coming to this place i'm here seven days a week um you know i get here at whatever let's call it seven am in the morning i leave at five at night six at night and uh i love coming and that's seven days a week i mean i haven't had a day off since a long time so i used to go to vegas but obviously during covid that's out i lost my 40 hour trips to las vegas so i've been here and and i got to be here because i i owe it to my team here i mean when covid hit this team stayed my packages stayed my trimmer stayed i mean these were people who were being threatened with eviction by unscrupulous landlords and i know that's a whole different political issue and people don't like hearing my my [ __ ] with that so i won't go there um but everyone was having a real tough time and these guys stayed they stayed and they worked and they worked in in the most stressful environments i owe them at least that much to be here you know like i owe them at least that much to be here so i'm here and uh like i said i don't know what i do without these guys frankly so uh i don't know so my advice to people if you want to get in find your team trust each other like you cut off a finger for the guy and girl to your left and right and go don't think about it just go okay that that's great advice and just kind of looking at my list here you know i'd love to talk a little bit more too about your guys's solvent-less efforts you know us being peer pressure and making solvents equipment you know did you guys just start off growing with the intention of doing solventless all along or did solventless come into the equation somewhere along like how did that become a part of your business and why yeah okay so two years ago i couldn't spell roslin so uh i was involved in a pretty high profile raid at the end of 2016 which is why i went to the state license system with gross sciences after that um with that i was kind of out of the game let's call it for a year when when this all hit literally couldn't spell rosin but my team you know like i was telling you about here are the biggest weed snobs in the in the earth as far as i'm concerned like they love telling me when it sucks literally they're like man this flower sucks so they were saying to me you gotta try this rosin you gotta try this rosin everywhere and uh that was that and i said well wait a second you know let's let's take a look and it just fit into our mantra clean cannabis i mean listen i know some brilliant extractors you know whether it's io whether it's you know a dread pirate who's with potent whether it's uh my due daisy extracts tanner these are people who make phenomenal concentrates with icy carbon no question about it but something about rosin you know just hit and we basically knew nothing and just spent a lot of money to learn and we made mistake after mistake after mistake um let me just tell you right now that january of last year i delivered flour rosin to dispensaries it was dark wasn't pretty it was pretty much [ __ ] and we were charging you know uh i think the dispensaries are charging sixty dollars a gram um yeah [ __ ] up right epic i mean you gotta start somewhere what are you gonna learn from it is it really a fuck-up right so um we've just learned and we've just barreled through like you know you know was we just barreled through and someone just commented uh smirk was a huge part of gs 100 he was so smirk whose actual name is john was my first cultivation manager here i hired him only a few months after i had got the building rolling and he was a massive part of this and he's over at loud lab in tucson doing great things and him and i talk about doing uh projects together to this day so awesome don and you know he's the dude sounds like you don't burn bridges yep and people listen man it's cannabis people are gonna move on to the next and greater thing and uh i'm happy for them you know and then we always make our way back later on so to get back into the solventless question you guys you know it was kind of a rocky start oh yeah where did you find some zen with your hash rosin it seems like that's where you probably had a big breakthrough basically it took us a year of beta testing we would run genetics and basically how we would do it is we would harvest it 52 days 56 days 60 days 65 days and 70 days yield color rosin conversion i mean just everything um absolutely everything and finally getting to the point we're at now but listen we get tons of complaints about lack of variety um i think a lot of people are really sick of gmo i get it um you know i i totally get it uh but we have a lot more new flavors coming out but it's tough to dedicate whole plants to rosin you really got to know what you're doing or you'll lose your ass and you know we lost easily a million dollars last year learning rosin simple wow no question about it easily easily so um now i know we're here on the quality side i truly believe that and now we're doing a lot of pheno hunting um you know a lot of the pheno hunting we do now is all for rosin and uh that's about it so you guys you know spend a ton of time money energy r d solventless and now all we're seeing in the comments are a million people saying how great your products are you guys have made carts you're making hash rosin tell me about your products tell me about your sku selection now that you've gotten over the hump of a lot of the trial and error or at least some of the harder parts you know you guys are making cards tell me about your sku selection with your solvent list so i kind of we like to keep it pretty lean here frankly okay so we did you know we spent about 10 months perfecting what we think is a great rosin cartridge we've had great traction in the market with it um you know we kind of went through various iterations of how to make it work um while adding nothing to it you know we we wanted a cartridge that was 100 rosin that's it and they're all live rosters um they're our most premium product um and now we're just doing different flavors of it so we'll take a base whether it's a wedding cake a gmo um and then we can add in so some of the new umami genetics the pink pellegrino the agua frescas we can add in our straight lemonade we can add in a purple punch which is like a fruit punch um all of that stuff you know we can you know we can do all that and that opens up some possibilities for us uh but really i think our next iterational product is going to be the edible side of it awesome i'm trying to we're in the middle of beta testing some solventless edibles um that's been a rocky process but we're but we're going through it um which is how we usually get things done here it's really never easy um and then this 7 10 friday we're actually we're dropping so i'm going to be butt-tending friday over at local joint which is this dispensary right next to our building awesome yeah it's the best stuff man our patients get to come in and voice their concerns and uh they don't [ __ ] right like it's it's no [ __ ] around crew that shows up for that but we're dropping a lot i mean we got runs live rods and hog with fresca's jam live rosin we got pink elegrino live rosin just a just a ton of [ __ ] um and uh i love doing that and we got a ton of new flavors coming and we're now dedicating two of our largest rooms here just to rosin so we're gonna keep everyone stocked but you know unfortunately no one's ripped the band-aid yet that you know this drought that's going on everywhere is because it takes so long to navigate this regulated nonsense we have to deal with and it's bad right i mean the regulation is is is tough i mean we're regulated harder than the food you eat at a grocery store or you know what you buy at a restaurant um the drought's only going to get worse in arizona no one's wanting to be honest about this scenario we're about to go wreck we're gonna vote on it in november they'll institute it by about may as my guest they're talking about january no shot i'd say by may and then it is going to be a [ __ ] show in arizona i mean 65 top shelf aids because let's be real who's going to absorb that 16 tax you know the dispensaries aren't probably going to absorb that they're going to pass it on to the consumer um we got to figure this out i mean growth science has to kill i mean growth sciences has to get a lot bigger um and uh yeah that's that's on my mind a lot you know i i know people are worried it's on my mind a lot and i'm worried about it and guys when you say the drought just so i'm clear you're saying that demand is vastly outstripping supply right now it is so when covet hit the arizona shops exploded so stores that used to order 200 eights a week from us we're ordering twelve hundred thousand holy cow so you guys are one or two x increase we're talking about six x increases here and everybody's in a drought right now so um we're gonna try and lead by example and throttle our pricing um you know we haven't raised our prices a lot of people have we haven't um we kind of stopped working with the vendors not vendors but the dispensaries that were fighting us on that in a certain sense uh which is fine that is their prerogative and they are fine to do that that's their business and they've invested millions of dollars and i do not uh blame them for that but you got a way that you run things and you're sticking to it i i'm trying my best you know and i'll fail a lot but i'm certainly uh i'm certainly trying my best so you guys are trying to grow then that's what that's what i'm hearing demand is going crazy we're expanding our indoor right now so we're going to be breaking ground hopefully here shortly the next few months uh we're going to go about two and a half x our current size we're going to bring our extraction solvent extraction in-house right now we outsource our bho product to the best in arizona to extract we are going to bring that in-house we are going to bring a kitchen in-house and we're going to expand cultivation by two and a half bucks but but that doesn't fix the problem because let's be real a lot of people on this stream probably buy your top tier but that's not what most cannabis sold is most cannabis sold is in that 25 that and it's bad right now it's real [ __ ] bad right now and it doesn't need to be it doesn't need to be so we've got to get into a greenhouse and that's what i'm trying to do right now and we're going to grow some amazing cannabis in there and we're going to address those tears and that's it you know and and that's my plan and i'm going to try my best like like i've been saying it's the best i can tell you um and i just hope everybody hangs in there with us because i'm depending on them you know hey growth isn't always easy and that's something that we've learned here at peer pressure recently too because we're expanding like crazy and it's a really tough process are you guys seeing as much demand for your solvent lists as you are for flour or is the flour it's the same okay either and it's just the same and uh yeah now the salt the ross inside i think i can fix better because i dedicated 80 lights to it so instead of just taking random sections i'm dedicating i'm dedicating 80 likes to it um so i think i'm really going to to have that figured out at least for a better level gotcha then obviously when i have the greenhouse i can address a lower priced rosin tier um we're also trying to make the switch to organic living soil uh next year commendable yeah so we're in the middle of that uh we're in the middle of uh that test right now and it's going pretty well um you know it's it's what it is but really what i'd love gross sciences to be remembered for if someone was asking was that we were here for the patients when it went wrecked and we kept this state from going to [ __ ] in the sense of the battle became about quality on all tiers not not the quantity not the race to the bottom not you know not [Music] i'm not you know not [ __ ] not the stuff that none of us got into this for i mean you know i started smoking so long ago that i know that what i was smoking was probably toxic you know 25 years ago my weed had more seeds than an advil bottle did um it's better now and people should get better and for the people like me that have the honor of being in the industry after the raids and after all the the [ __ ] we owe it to the next generation to do this [ __ ] right and um i think we have an at that to do that and i'd love to to take this family to california and i'd love to take this family to wherever it wants to go and weed for me has been my life man it's it's not a part of me it's just kind of everything it's how i got kicked out of my house it's how i dropped out of college it's how i lost everything so many times it's how i would walk into random spots and smell someone else who had weed on them and we could like share a glance and know that we're in the [ __ ] together without saying a word [Music] all that stuff is real to me and i'm just i'm not gonna jeopardize it and we owe it to that next generation to show them what the [ __ ] is up from the older people like me and uh i'm gonna do what i got to do and that's it well it sounds like you guys have some pretty big plans at growth sciences you're talking about uh going out of state too what are some markets that you guys are looking into or is that confidential nothing here is confidential um so we're looking heavily into san diego right now [Music] i would love to be in nevada because i'm a drunk and a gambling addict so vegas is your home you know my vacations are usually i leave thursday after work and fly back saturday from vegas and you know yes and you know i i love that [ __ ] you know i i love uh i love it and uh so i'd love to go nevada california arizona but here man i'll tell you what you know i was in colorado picking up a lot of different products a few months ago and um i love that there's still rock and deli style there and i'd love to be a part of that like i love deli style like it's [ __ ] heartbreaking we don't do that as the normal anymore um but yeah you know it's uh yeah it's so i'd love that but california nevada arizona hell yeah all day nice nice that that'd be cool i mean a lot of people in the comments are sounding like they'd love to see you we had a question asking you guys about you'd be up in the northwest because they said that they didn't like too much of the solvent lists up there um it sounds like solventless has come really far in arizona was solventless a big deal even a year ago is this more of a recent phenomena for you guys it's it's the last year i would call it since basically june of last year to june of this year but you know i think that people took chances on us you know the community took chances on us and um it's paid off for both of us because it gave us the opportunity to get better at our craft and it gave them the opportunity to get into solvent lists if they weren't already um and let's be real most of the kids that were into the solvent list were going to cali and just getting it illegally right you know it's still there and i'm not gonna talk [ __ ] about the black market i was the black market and a lot of my friends are and that's that this this whole thing was on their backs and uh that's that we'll just leave that one alone yeah i think it's just worth noting very briefly that you know experience didn't come from nowhere as it were you know people had to learn the hard way and it sounds like you know you've been involved growing for a long time so you know where do you see solvent list going with your operation as the year progresses what what is what is your solvent-less outlook right now outside of edibles everything everywhere everything um basically i want to come out with some new consistencies and when i say i'll come out with the consistencies that means i'm going to take credit for my lab manager tanner's genius and he'll actually come out with the consistency and um we'll rock and roll that way um i basically just want to get solventless in arizona along with other players in the market you know potent planet should be in this [ __ ] uh true infusion should be in this [ __ ] who the hell wants to go to a dispensary and just see one brand that's not sexy no one wants that like going to jungle boys store they got other brands in there like you want to have options you know when i go to the dyspo i'm always buying other people's stuff yeah so other people need to jump in and the good news in arizona is we have this magical thing we're in a drought so there's no competition just come out with a good product you'll have a seat at the table we're making the table bigger we're making the table bigger we don't need to compete with anybody come on in let's [ __ ] rock and roll right so if there's a drought there's plenty of room here for other growers and other operations i mean one thing that i'll say that's incredibly refreshing talking to you is just your honesty and your humility i feel like there's so many egos in the cannabis in the hash world that are just absolutely outrageous you're coming at this very level-headed so you think that there's plenty of room for people in the market that's a perspective we don't hear super often there's nothing worse than an arrogant fat dude let's leave it at that it's not pretty it's like a fat man crying you just don't want to see it no one wants to see that yeah everyone's got ego i've got a huge ego you know whatever uh i think it's healthy and here's why i think it's healthy it's because people love this [ __ ] so much they love this [ __ ] so much and i love that they love it that much so i'm in let's just keep it going here's what i don't want i don't want people to lose their passion and if that means they'd rather be a snob or arrogant done let's roll i'm good with it okay i'm good with it so there's definitely a difference there between what you could maybe call uh a healthy obsession passion ego for cannabis being obsessed with quality versus just being so full of yourself that you won't even listen to other people and you don't even want other people to be a part of your market is that a fair distinction to make perhaps who the hell wants to live like that anyway that just sounds like listen i ain't donald trump i mean i don't know [ __ ] frankly what it is you know i'm aware i don't know [ __ ] so yeah i love listening to everybody and um i'll try to keep us as level-headed as possible and i'll fail i'll be better then you know it is what it is and you know i'm in my 40s now i'm too old is what it is well for everyone who's tuning in here uh we will have this full episode up on youtube soon and you can watch it on instagram after the fact for everyone who's tuned in late or who hasn't been here for the whole thing we've got matt with growth sciences out of arizona this is one of the biggest audiences we've ever had some of the most positive comments we've ever had clearly you guys have a huge following you're doing it right uh you know matt i'd love to also uh some of the time that we've got left here you know we talked a little bit about some of the advice that you had for people who are trying to start businesses what advice do you have for people that are trying to get their grows locked down you have a ton of grow experience and that's something that you know we don't often hear enough of uh with our extraction world but it's as soil grown said on one of our last episodes you know thank a grower what advice do you have for people to grow the best quality product possible if you don't love cannabis don't be a grower that's step number one stay out of my business okay like this is a business for people who love cannabis and love people if you don't love people and you don't love cannabis you're not a grower i don't care if you have 18 degrees from mit and you know everything and you can speak to any science i don't give a [ __ ] your cannabis isn't going to be for me so number one you want to love cannabis you want to love people once you have that then it's all about building your bench you've got to have a team around you that has the same focus passion and compliments your weaknesses you know i'm not a i'm not a businessman you know i'm not a technology guy i'm not smart you know but my partner mike you throw is a [ __ ] genius and he's a true executive and a good person and you know him and i agree on almost nothing and that's why it works that's why it works we find that middle ground together and i feel like there's like magic there you know um i think that you've got to have good legal on your side most of the criminals are not in the black market they're in the state license game let's not kid ourselves more [ __ ] goes on in the state license system that i can even talk about because i sell at all these dispensaries and you know it is what it is um a lot of bad people a lot of unscrupulous business people and uh you gotta avoid that you've gotta pay for your deal properly you have to have a proper lease on your on your cultivation facility you have to have a proper lease with your approval to operate with who's ever giving that to you because licenses in arizona right now cost seven to fifteen million dollars holy cow seven seven to fifteen million dollars is that to get operational break that down just a little bit for me because that sounds like illinois pricing no no that's the license that's nothing that's just a piece of paper that says you can grow sell or extract seven to 15 million and let me give you the worst news you want to know who owns them all harvest they've got 30 plus out of the 130 in our state and we're going to talk about that there's no monopolies come on anyway i got to get off that topic because it's not good so yeah so your legal counsel would advise you to yeah they've already i'm getting i'm getting the looks right now so it's bad so here's the deal though this is the deal though seven to 15 million to get a license 150 a square foot to build out cultivation once you've acquired the building two hundred thousand dollars in legal uh what else let me make sure i remember this all right then you gotta have a six-month runway of operating capital right so throw another half mil to 750 000. uh your insurance is going to be off the charts uh we pay for everyone's health care at our company that's off the track there's all these different things right i mean you know it's millions and millions of dollars so uh you gotta have your team you gotta have your bench [Music] and the rest is uh you know it's gonna be a mixture of luck drive and passion and uh that's it and yeah i wish i had something better to say but hey you know what i think honesty is the most important thing that people could stand to hear who are trying to get into this do you think that if and when arizona goes wreck that that will become more expensive or less expensive well i think it could stay the same because i think rack excuse me that's a weed cough not corona don't worry um is already built in to these prices because they're [ __ ] right so take a dispensary that's doing 300 000 a month 3.6 million a year let's say that they're running at 18 net which is about the average call it 20 right that means they're making 720 000 who on flux earth is paying 15 million for that your roi is 20 years down the road so yeah it's all garbage right but um i think rex built in but if you're like a a true med you know who murders the game right now yeah you're probably gonna be more than that um you know it's so i think it's all the ways but no i think for the most part wreck is probably already baked in to those numbers i certainly hope so because you know the iteration of growth sciences i'm looking for is us to be in the retail dispensary gotcha i want to have grow science as the dispensary so that mike and i can build out the customer experience the way we've always thought it needed to be and um that's the iteration of growth sciences that we're truly working on frankly uh if we were to talk confidential that's the most i'll say about it but we need to go vertical i need a place for patients to come in where they know it's gs and uh i'll be there for them to talk [ __ ] too if we make a mistake no that's awesome that you guys you know really have a vision for where you're trying to go with all this you know we've got about you know five six minutes left here um you know we kind of i i put a lot of questions together we've gotten through some of them you know i'd love to give some of this remaining time to you you know are there any topics that you want to cover or that you feel like you could educate people who are tuned in on uh you know we're really big on education and just trying to bring up the community with us um you know what do you want to share with everyone are there any topics you want to cover before we wrap up um i mean topics i'm not really uh sure i think a message i'd like to leave with everyone is people are really hard on each other in cannabis for whatever reason and i get it once again it's because everyone's passionate about it i think people think we make it look easy i i have to tell you guys we make so many mistakes getting to where we are every single day you know hang in there with us and if you're thinking you know whatever reason anybody can do this if you love cannabis get into it don't give up on your dream don't let the msos own this [ __ ] you can do it the people want to believe where they go to buy their cannabis we're not 10 years down the road yet where people are just you know maybe stop at a convenience store you know to buy their [ __ ] like we're still in a time where people want to care about where they shop and they want to care about what they're putting into their bodies and and all these different things and um if your dreams to be in cannabis go do it you know i i i lost my choices early on with all the felonies and [ __ ] like that you know i is what it is right you know my parents were both doctors i should have gone the legal way of life and you know i didn't have a lot of friends in high school and my choice was to connect with the people who connected with me over marijuana and you know it started you know when i was 13. i had cancer and i was lucky enough to have cannabis and uh that's my family like that's who i'm with my family are the cannabis people we speak the same language you know we share the same visions and uh that's it and and if you bump into me somewhere and i throw you a smile or or whatever like it's because i know exactly what you're thinking because i'm thinking the same thing and i'm absolutely with you so uh that's about it that i mean that's an inspiring story man and i i mean no platitudes with that and for everyone who's tuning in just to sum up that golden kernel of knowledge there you know if you're not already in it just make the jump make it happen that's what i did my story is not as interesting as yours is but i took the same leap of faith and i'm really happy that i did and for anyone else who's here i'm sure that they've done something similar and if you haven't maybe it's time that you should so matt i'd love for you to tell everyone you know where can people find your products uh what do you what so here's the deal we're dropping some fire sunset sherbert right now uh we're dropping 7 10 i'll be at local joint with a bunch of bunch of rosin um the following week we're going to drop apple fritter and runs flower across the valley um but yeah guys we're in the [ __ ] drought right all right so show up early wait good news we just harvested a whole room of amazing o.g and give us a few weeks on that and uh yeah that's gonna be some fire um but let me just tell you man thank you for for getting in the industry because your presses kill it for us they changed the game for us no question and um you got to keep that going when everyone depends on you guys for the new and upcoming tech i mean that's that's all you it shouldn't be underrated how hard it is to do that you got to deal with all the extractors all day i do not envy you one iota um you know i don't envy you on iota but you're killing it and uh you know we're pressure for life man uh we're with you guys and thank you support and you know uh as this stream comes to an end because i'm sure everyone's probably bored with us i just wanted to be saying um i did want to thank everybody who uh who uh signed on to listen to me ramble a little bit um and just thank them uh

right that's our [Music] legal washington hash brand right on [Music] do [Music] you", "cHz4xTYET24": "howdy howdy there beautiful people guys are all having a amazing start to your day night whatever the hell you're watching this hope it's going great for you we've got a little video here I haven't really done many of these but a lot of other cannabis content creators do these videos and I think a lot of people enjoy it we've got some strain reviews coming up today and of course we're starting with the hottest hash on the alerting rec market happy cabbage farms so happy cabbage farms they came into camp in probably about four months ago I don't know exactly when they came on to the Oregon rec market but at the time it was a pretty Minzy era in the Oregon rec market here in Benton there was just a lot of the companies have really slipped towards the end of the summer and a lot of their stuff really wasn't tasting as good as it was towards the beginning of the summer then comes heavy cabbage farms with hash robison and we don't see hot rods in a lot in the rec market because it's such an expensive and kind of niche product there's not very many people that are searching to pay a lot of money for hash rasam but when you [ __ ] try this hash frozen you're just sucked right on back in guys it is ridiculous this stuff I will tell you I have tried tons of hot rods and a lot of the times I'm going to say that's my favorite hat rosin because I don't get to try it very often happy cabbage now has been around for about four months and they are a group in our circle it's just been around I've gotten to dab it a lot and I've gotten to dab a lot of other hash rosin because I don't have to pay for it other people have it and I will tell you guys there's a couple strands that I have not liked from them but these four right here that I have are so titties I would stick my face between all of them and motorboat myself to death this is hands-down the best half rosin I have ever smoked and it's on the wreck more kit if you are over 21 you can buy this you don't have to [ __ ] buy it black market you don't have to pay the $120 for black market six star hash rosin it gets it cannot expensive for a while there guys so to see a company coming out with stuff that's between sixty and seventy five dollars and medic maybe even cheaper than that that's super impressive and just such a breath of refreshing air so this guy I've got open right here first thing when I open it this is the purple starburst og six star like just what in there is just a bad thing to say let's take a look at what we going got going on in this jar alrighty here we have the purple starburst og 6 star you guys can see it's nice and flaky there's no real huge clumps partly because I dabbed a lot of them partly because it is 6 star and it is just gorgeous look at that color sorry for the shaking I'm filming on my phone they check that out just absolutely gorgeous I am completely enthralled with the look of this rosin I'm enthralled with the look as well as the smell a second you open up this up you get hit in the face with the real ocean groan oh gee smell and it's been a long time since we've gotten that we're getting more chem more gassy oh geez out here this is real ocean groan oh gee and then on the end of it is like this almost faint hint of like purple lavender not in a floral way at all but in a very very gassy way like I can't even begin to explain this we're gonna go ahead and take it yeah we got two rigs out today we first we're gonna start out with the prophecy glass and get a little function shot and I'll shop for you guys we don't have the cleanest rigs or bangers today just kind of caught me on an off cleaning day but maybe we should still be able to see that function right we're gonna start off with the purple starburst it guys this stuff is absolutely amazing I cannot tell you how much I recommend going and trying just the strain right here all of happy cabbage farm is fantastic this strain right here hands down my favorite let's go ahead and get her heat it up and get into some freakin turf skies I am excitement for this video you can not believe how hard it is to have four jars of happy cabbage sitting in a drawer knowing you can't smoke it because you have to come with it it's literally heartbreaking I also want to give them a huge shout out for sponsoring the 420 of it at the Pacific Circle that was absolutely amazing they set up a tab bar anybody that came by could have their stuff a company that produces this high a product of this high quality of product just allow anybody to come up and smoke it no no [ __ ] questions asked is just amazing huge shout out to them for that call that good set a timer for 45 seconds alright we're gonna go ahead get in here and scoop ourselves out a nice flaky dab of this gorgeous six star here we go guys first dab of the half cab farms Cheers [Music] oh good lordy that is so delicious straight to the head immediately my whole head warm fuzzy dice feels delicious but you just know media we have strongest it because it hits you momentarily after you take it down man is a good video to be filming guys yeah I also got to say this is mind-bending how good that flavor is and how much flavor there is usually with a lot of even really good tasting dabs only a small percentage of flavor this there is a large percentage of flavor in that [ __ ] strain it is amazing how much you get out of it I love it for our first thing to have in the morning like if you got one dab to set your whole day straight that's it right there that purple starburst og alright move on to the next string I believe this one was a collab width Oh pull on a stick and throw it into my house I rip the [ __ ] alright I threw the Box away in the heavy collab on it [ __ ] oh no without gaps in garden Gadsden Gardens okay this one is a collab with Gadsden garden and this is Tropicana punch now this one has a much much different look to it let me give you guys an initial smell test it was like pomegranate and man what is that that is a good [ __ ] smell right there it was like pomegranate and fish I'm not like just weed but the actual cush like when you're exhaling a cush strain it smells like that oh man that's delicious now this one has a much different look to it way more waxy was this one what was this one called no just Tropicana punch hash rosin not six-star not their batter or their jam just hash shots but still absolutely delicious looking kind of looks like peanut butter and this was not what I do what it looked like when they gave it to me when it was cold it was much much more pretty and hadn't like waxed up into this solid state yet still [ __ ] beautiful we're gonna switch it up we've got the DBE 503 slimeball rig all ready to go over here a dab of this junk ambush I believe this is the one that gave me a job on the night of 4/20 and I was just absolutely mind blown by how good the flavor of it was so much rudiness to it but still keeping a really nice base in the OG gas cushy that kind of a chem that kind of a taste so I'm keeping it sweet waste in there but still having some food on top I'm a big fan of fruity strains but when I have to smoke all day every day it's not my favorite I really really want the Kim gasps og scum push stuff like that all right that's all set a timer 45 seconds that's not that's not the right dance isn't it there was a dude I'm just gonna stop him all right if vijaya tease this one's a lot easier to load up I'm just gonna take this a nice big chunk here boom I am gonna be so blitzed by the end of this guy's four dabs of hatch rosin and that I haven't gotten into this yet but I'm sure you guys read the title we're taking out Widowmaker at the end but yeah let's do it [ __ ] drop the dead Cheers [Music] [Music] get right with that safe before really really fruity but it keeps its [ __ ] feet planted firmly in a nice little og tastes good very clean - I mean like of course there's no solvents in it but a lot of other people's half-frozen I get a a wheezing in my lungs and that's usually the reason I stay away from hats Rossum as you guys can hear [Music] there is some coffee but there's no wheeze and that is what I love about this stuff it just seems so clean so pure you're tasting exactly what this amazing weed was meant to taste like guys we're going nips out go the [ __ ] nips out Jesus Christ two tabs of hash rosin in we've got the purple starburst and oh wait no the Tropicana punch and the purple starburst yeah okay yes yes boom so we've got punch breath up next this is their jam and this one unfortunately has slowly disintegrated in a series of very unfortunate dabs that were completely unavoidable but I think a little bit left so we have something for this video right here I'm gonna zoom the camera in so you guys can see it's really really clear and very very light in color but it is so ganbei good I can't even begin to tell you guys how many Terps they've got packed into that gorgeous little [ __ ] doing GM glove there when you get in this one it immediately has like a purple smell I use that to describe a lot away I don't know what the purple smell is I don't know what I'm describing there I'm sure there's some people out there that are gonna be like yeah and there's some people are gonna be like what the [ __ ] he's that high already but it does it smells purple purple with a hint of fruit punch on the end that's exactly what I'm getting clenched breath and it's really really cool how true their flavors are guys like you can't even begin to tell you how many other hot rods and strings like taste we're like this one's strong in and you taste it that's great it's amazing how many people just they'll name their strains anything just because that's what's hype that's what's selling right now these guys they've just got some fire a sweet in fire ass hash on the way out switching it back up again to the prophecy glass for our punch breath dab here I'm gonna go ahead and heat this up man guys given that Widowmaker at the end it's gonna be so brutal I have already baked like a cupcake my gourd is gone stone to the bone I just [ __ ] rent I think you guys a good idea of how ripped I am I've taken two gaps and I already am starving I don't feel like I need a turf map two naps like I thank you I'm taking seven gram damage guys this we just took like maybe point one maybe and I'm already ready for a turf down at the end of this I'm going to pass out right here after I've ordered new greens call it good BAM wham Shazam set timer for 45 seconds Thank You Carla alright let's go ahead scrape ourselves out some of this leaving just enough left to put into our Widowmaker jab guys we got we got some crazy stuff going with a maker jab this punch breath was definitely one of my favorites it was a lighter high than the six star starburst og but had just about the same percentage of flavor it's fan-fucking-tastic really allowed me to go about my day if I was smoking it in the morning before say a meeting or something it would be really good for that not if you were gonna go out and want a dad that was gonna last you three to four hours that would be the purple starburst six star that stuff is just [ __ ] tits it is so strong BAM Thank You Carla let's take this damn choose people it's tons tons and tons of flavor [Music] [Music] now we got the sweats going big time holy Jebus how is it is hot in here oh my god keeping you close holy [ __ ] this was a good fight hey promised the Widowmaker again oh [ __ ] turf sweats aren't [ __ ] real oh my god whoa next up we got some margarita punch six star don't let the nips cool off for a second here wow that overheated a needle is in the red Oh rubbie oh my god I completely forgot we have water over here not sponsored by but shout out the can event for carrying the happy cabbage four guys are in Central Oregon looking for a place to pick this stuff up get a man got it they got so many different strains oh yes we got one left guys we've got the margarita place six star same with the starburst og let's go ahead and take peak here in this jar very very flaky but it is all stuck together none of it is gonna fall out I don't believe ya all stuck in there when I first got it was flaky like if you sneezed it would go everywhere like a pile of blow it was pretty [ __ ] flaky oh man oh man this one probably actually I'm gonna have to take my my vote back for the smell this one has better smell than the purple starburst dojin form starburst oh gee I do believe tastes better but god damn margarita punch they're definitely a hint of that tropic punch in there but there is a kick what is that kick gasps that is straight gasp oh man yeah once you get past that punch just gassy oh that is good it doesn't have the og smell of the purple starburst I mean it is just Tropicana punch instead of deep purple starburst OG um but it does have a massive undertone of some gassy flavors go ahead keep the slime ball ring up last one and probably take a little two-minute walk around the house and then we're gonna dive into that way a but nothing's more currently done I am so big guy so I can feel my hind legs coming down [ __ ] just set a timer for 45 seconds Thank You Carla thank you very much I can feel my eyelids coming down like heavy hard it is I'm gonna be in for a real long afternoon here we got a photo we got the Gus glass show circle tonight [ __ ] I'm gonna be licking windows all night long guys so yeah super flaky super super potent smell let's get some [ __ ] taste in here oh yes oh yes wants to scrape it all off the bottom it is super flaky again yep all right we got a margarita punch six star and hash browns and over here I bring a ball right up in clothes for you guys kitchens function off the first initial hit oh my god I need a new cord after this video it's not even baked out of it it's just oh [ __ ] cheers everyone a lot more gas when you smoke it less of the push flavor than the go wow they're really not my favorite in terms of flavor definitely not bad whatsoever it's still delicious I'm probably ranked this number three the Tropicana punch probably be my least favorite out of the four but honestly I would buy all four strains again thanks they say that they're that good all scraped up on a piece of paper see if we can get it um damn er and then we will take a lap mop it off a bit and take this [ __ ] Widowmaker all those cobbles alright we got our four grams right here I have completely forgotten which one goes to which cap so that will be interesting we're just going to go ahead and see if we can take this damper here and get some of each of these on here it's not going to be a monster dabbe but I mean big enough for some fun boom there's our starting scoop of the punch breath now this is this is the margarita punch now this is gonna be a little difficult this stuff is so flaky I'm not quite sure we might have to get like a spoon for this so I'm gonna just take some of this and yeah there's no way it's gonna stick on there take that off and then last but not least we need the what what was this I forget [ __ ] I think I've lost more oil in here than I got out definitely alright well there's that there's what I've got and there's also some on this damper too this stuff has all different consistencies let me see if I can't like splurge some of this long as dabber just smush it all together that's kind of working I'd say that's working pretty damn good alright let's look at our dab here guys oh [ __ ] yeah oh Jesus alright alright let's let's get her going oh my god this is gonna be fun I literally didn't move any of this because I was terrified that the dab would fall off the dabber I think we are very lucky and fortunate that we got all that hash onto a bro without any of it falling off I didn't I think that was going to happen as this on a monster Widowmaker but like I was saying before guys - dabs in I was pretty [ __ ] toasted we're at a point now where I am just I'm good at I could be good for today for smuggling I am [ __ ] why are we doing this because you got your [ __ ] awesome but I love each and every one of you that's why we're [ __ ] doing this get in there fam calling that good guys this is

always please be kind to one another Cheers I'll see you guys soon", "SwWQeTwtC00": "[Music] hello and welcome back to the cannabis Somali eh I'm your host Andrew Friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of cannabis reviews today because of legalization 2.0 the new product categories I'm finally able to bring you a legally distributed extract now it's not the extract or the quality that you may have seen on the channel two years ago or any of the hash rosen's that I've had recently gifted to me by friends but at least it is an extract in the legal market it's something that I can purchase to really ramp things up and it's starting to feel more like the legacy market of purchasing cannabis in the dispensary now that we have these products so what did I get today we have BC Keef and this BC Keith is coming to us from can of farms I didn't look where canif arms is but I have a feeling it's not in BC but it might be that was a good ramble needless to say I don't know but it's called BC Keith and you can see it there maybe if it'll focus no I got another video there we go BC Keith can of farms you can read everything going on there see our duty steel still on perfect I picked this up yesterday for the low low price of twenty seven dollars for one gram of Keith CR twenty seven dollars maybe twenty seven bucks the green easy there are four hundred twenty one forty two point one milligrams of THC and total THC is three hundred thirty two milligrams so that'll be interesting to just see how much contaminant is in here with that note ice with an extra six hundred milligrams of something in there that's not THC and no CBD we can only assume that it is a plant matter but who knows this is the equivalent of it says content equivalent of four grams of carrying cannabis so that's interesting our Keef packaged on 2019 11:27 today is March the fourth start a cool cool dry place camp section and what's our warning adolescents are at a greater risk neo daily used for long period of time can harm brain development well I'm doing pretty good but if you're under the age of 18 click out of this video now cuz you're not even supposed to be here so there we go there is our beautiful product we have our seal Duty seal here and let's just crack right in shall we try on the new two camera so that we get a little bit closer of a view when we open up these products and now you can see our nicely set jar if I can get it out with a false bottom in the package let's check that out so just to have some more shelf space or something I don't actually know why you would need to do that but that's okay we'll see things in the future changing so here is our package and you know I wouldn't have been upset actually just getting this with all the information off the shelf but there's no branding on it and there's an apparent smell of cannabis coming off of it so there we go the nice blue glass oh yeah the blue glass yuan jar so that's a that's a nice perk for sure here we go and do we have a different warning frequent to prolong cannabis containing tea if she can contribute to mental health problems over time BC chief I don't know what where DC or why they call it BC chief but it's obviously not strand-specific and again packed Sean 11:27 pretty cool let's open it up shall we our first legal extract and our first legal extract has a nice jar with a child seal on it so of course there we go and that is the first look of our BC Keef there it is you can see I've got the nice close-up video now though recommended by a YouTube follower thank you so much for your recommendation so it is a little green it's uh it's looking like a pre you know it's um it's a it's a pretty rough tumble without a doubt I don't think it's um just take through it a little bit here okay so it's clumped up it does still have a little bit of moisture going on in it let's see how it smells it smells a little green to be very honest with you it's a little over tumbled I didn't expect like the most amazing Keefe hash whatever for those of you that don't know the word Keith Keefe is usually the sifted hash the that forms in the bottom of your grinder has been the slang term that I've always used for Keef but it's just a jet\u00e9 today anibus usually found in the bottom chamber of your grinder I'm wondering if there's even in this one just to show a contrast of what grinder Keith yes there is so that's my grinder Keith just a little bit this is probably really old and then that's the color of this so it is pretty close without a doubt I can't say anything about that so it smells a little green has like some really big woodsy aromas that I would relate to lemongrass sandalwood maybe a little bit of pine some fresh downed trees I'm gonna put a little bit of my fingers actually and squish it and just see if we can get anything going here that's what it looks like all my fingers and let's see if I can just smell it better mmm smells like very handsome Cologne sandalwood musk earthy musky a little bit of a citrus definitely is gonna taste good like as I smell it and I smell a cannabis aromas smells good my fingers are a little bit sticky after rubbing it but nothing crazy so I figured out you would use two ways to kind of evaluate this sample just because it is straight Keith I didn't know exactly what I should do I've always used my vaporizer it's not a dabble product by any means there is contaminant and particulate in it so I'm thinking that I will do a puff of the volcano vaporizer and then I have this bong that I got in grade 11 that I cleaned up and I thought I'd have a puff out of that too for you since uh since we're playing that game so let's just have a load up on our volcano here I have a new camera facing down so that I can show you all of the unboxings a little bit closer as opposed to holding it up so that is what I'm doing down there Sears our volcano bowl and I'm going to put a good load of the Keef in there we go spread it out so it's nice and flat I'm not in these balls so that we don't get any of that nonsense there we go maybe a little more for just for good luck we are doing a a review so there we go and I didn't wait this one either mainly because I just don't know how we're going to weigh it it was a pretty full jar of light Akif so I'm hoping that they didn't rip me off but what have we found with our legal cannabis reviews in the past that well 70% of them have been short so you know I could see that happening with my Keef but I'm writing tickets about so let's load this up air and while that happens there I'm gonna load my bowl up still have a messy but that's okay well two things at once two things at once there we go all right smells good in the air smells very cannabis e very woodsy I didn't get much but what I did get really tastes like how it smells musky lemony very much like Cologne that would have been worn in the 1990s I'm gonna let it sit on there for a sec just a little that Keefe warm up and I'm going to go back to back in this bowl of Keefe up because we're gonna take one one big friggin rip a dip of this I believe here we go that's that and now my ball should be warmed up [Music] do you like Keith I always love it as a supercharger it's really nice when you open up the bottom of your grinder and you find those dunes again I'm happy that these products are on market and for $27 I can say I'm oh you know I'm not upset right now with my purchase this time I let the hash warm up in the bowl sitting on top of the heating unit and it is quite tasty it all tastes the same every time I do musky sandalwood II delicious so it's yeah pretty good well let's have our bong rip and then give you our final notes and my final goodbye I've got this big-ass bowl of hash Keef pack BC Keith from kin of farms let's roll back little it's definitely fair to say I've had a bong rip in a long time okay it was good it definitely didn't suck so here we go let's do the rundown on appearance it's definitely not the best key hash anything that I have ever seen by any means but it looks nice it looks like blond hash from high school so there's that as far as appearance goes I'm going to give it a the jar they put it in is really nice and they'll end up and the childproof lid was slick so let's give it and this is for what is being Keefe I'm gonna give it 17 points 17 points for the appearance on the nose it wasn't jumping out but it definitely still smells like what it tasted like the nose knows that my nose said you should definitely smoke this for the nose I'd like to give it 32 points it could be bigger it could be better but it's definitely not lacking or upsetting me it's not jumping out but it does have these nice woodsy musky somewhat citrusy aroma for the taste I thought the taste match the palate really well again it wasn't huge it wasn't explosive in my mouth it wasn't like oh my god this is the best hash Keef whatever I've ever tried didn't taste bad in the bong definitely tasted better in the vaporizer so for taste let's give it a solid you know this is falling with the nose too right if the nose was bigger than the taste would have been bigger I'm gonna want to call it 15 points for the taste not bad not amazing that's 75% and then my overall impression based on my experience with cannabis based on my experience with the legal market all of these things coming into play you know what I don't mind this product it's definitely an addition to a joint or something that you'd like to buy to add into your basket to really ramp everything up so as far as that goes I'm gonna give it 17 points and there you go that's the score on our can of farms BC Keef pretty good for especially for $27 so well let's add up the points right here duh how many points is that 27 bucks a gram Keith definitely not the worst thing to purchase in the recreational market as these things become available this is the very first extract I've seen that's why I purchased it I guess I guess I'm pleasantly surprised it's probably it's it's in the 80s for sure it might be high 70s but it's in the 80s so it's it's it's not bad I'm not completely upset there you go thank you so much for watching if you tried any extracts let me know down in the comments I'm really looking forward to having more extracts come on to market but it's exciting to see this happening please make sure to LIKE comment share and subscribe and I'll see you soon Cheers what's my name what's my name the cannabis Somali yang", "0peKkiKvhH4": "[Music]

I've never had one of these before it's a rosin cartridge what is going on you guys my name is Jeff also known as popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe I got a lot of lip videos on the way like today I'm gonna be showing you when I picked up from silver stem cannabis in my last video if you missed that video I got to tour their entire dispensary bring you guys with me show you what it's actually like inside of there it's [ __ ] sick make sure you check out that video a link to it will be in the description but right now I'm going to show you guys what I actually bought and what it looks like because there's some fire ass products there when you buy weed legally it comes with a receipt I spent two hundred and seventy seven dollars it would have been two twenty before tax but there's some hefty taxes in Colorado but it's worth it because hey I can [ __ ] buy the [ __ ] in the store I don't need to have a plug I don't need to fly with my own it's nice just being able to go into a store and pick out some [ __ ] and even with the tax it's so much cheaper than it is in Pennsylvania like you don't pay taxes when you buy weed in Pennsylvania but the growers and the processors and the stores are definitely paying a lot in taxes and that goes down to you so you might not pay a tax but you're being taxed alright let's start with these I picked up these little tablets just cuz I've never seen these before they're called pressies they have desired effects on them like sleep energy focus they only have like five or ten milligrams of THC in them so they're not very potent but they come with some other stuff that are supposed to actually help increase the desired effects that are labeled on the package I try out the focus ones just see what it's like it's literally like a little tablet and says a little THC mark on it's pretty cool I know if you're supposed to chew it or pop it I'm really glad I read that it says right on the bottom swallow don't you alright guys I'll see if that 10 miligrams does anything to me but I'm gonna be smoking a lot on top of it so I probably won't even really feel it you know I get high as [ __ ] all day and I get distracted so much stuff this could actually like help me focus real a little like that'd be kind of cool now let's get to the live rosin you guys picked up some olio I picked up the strain tropic sunset its a mix between slur Akane number 4 and papaya punch number 3 I didn't even smell it honestly like the name just sold me if you watched the video yesterday though you saw him open up a package of oleo they have such beautiful packaging man it's really [ __ ] cool they definitely take the extra step to make sure there's a great presentation with the product and the products really good so you really can't go wrong with them and just like the homie said it comes a little dab tool I didn't let it sit flat last night so you can see a little bit dripped onto the side but that's not the end of the world oh my god you guys this [ __ ] looks so good I was sure you're gonna close up for this if you guys can see that like it's just a beautiful yellow has a very nice consistency to it it's like a liquidy sugar and that's what's so cool about rosin man there's so many different consistencies that it ends up being just loaded up the puff coke peak I hope you guys are smoking with me let me know in the comments what you guys are smoking on every go you guys man I just like flew away and went to heaven that tastes so good [Music] my god you guys even when I look on this you guys truly [ __ ] beautiful job if you guys are ever in Colorado pick up some holy Arase Jim I really like this dispensary you guys they have some top-shelf concentrates there flowers amazing that's what I'm about to show you next but just like with over 300 dispensaries in Denver it's hard to find like all the good ones so as soon as you find one that has like great prices and great products like I just wanted to keep going to it damn I picked up two strains I picked up at indica and sativa flower this is the mimosa this is one of my favorite sativa strains I love smoking joints in mimosa if you've had mimosa before you already know but if you haven't you got to try it man it's some great [ __ ] weed and this is a shame that the budtender sold Deon he was very helpful this [ __ ] like I usually don't for whatever reason strains that have the word silver in it I don't like I don't even not like them I just like tend to just like not look at it because I'm like in my head I'm like gold is the best of silver my aunt but this is called silver OG and like I don't know if we get much better than this like it is a heavy indica it is like that deep green with like bright white trichome still so it looks like it has like snow on it this little it looks like the Tegrity farms Christmas snow weed and like if that was true that would be very concerning I don't know how good the shots do it for the weed but oh my god you guys it is a fire I honestly think I'm gonna go back to silver stuff before I go home and get some more flour because they had some great strains out there I just started with one indica and one sativa preheating the peak right now cheers you guys that was a nice reheat what I really like about the earrings is you can put a decent amount of wax in there and like if you take a big dab it's not all wasted like you can just reheat it and keep smoking it but this you guys is what I'm most excited to show you I've never had one of these before it's a rosin cartridge I paid too much money for this but I had to do it I said I wanted to try some cool cartridges while I was out here and I mean it happened this is from olio I don't want to skip over how great their packaging is they do such a good job on it that I feel like it deserves a little second I love you can kind of tell it has a little bit more of a foggy hue to it than a normal cartridge it's really cool how it says the strain on it too because sometimes you forget what strain you're smoking or if you have a lot of cartridges you can get them confused again using my cloud products rio+ different color but I just love these batteries they're one of my favorites cheers you guys wow that is one of the best AC cartridges I've ever had it's papaya punch that's gonna taste [ __ ] awesome but if being rosin versus actual distillate holy [ __ ] and like I can feel it like I'm getting really high off this like I can feel it on the face in the eyes this is not your normal cartridge this is crazy holy [ __ ] this is like one hit and you're high and it literally tastes like a rosin dab this isn't saying you guys the future man they can work on the price a little bit it would be way more feasible but what a great experience like I'm [ __ ] ripped I am so happy I got this this is the last thing we got through the liquid live resin cartridge I picked it off the name and the package honestly the [ __ ] is really cool and having a garlicy cartridge I've never had that before and it sounds pretty interesting chum the company Green Dot it's a [ __ ] [ __ ] to open here's the inside packaging cartridge is sitting on the side to push right through here to get the cartridge out then it gives you the stats on the back just peel here and don't use this if you're pregnant okay that this cartridge has a little adjustable air flow filter I don't really like these what it does is give you either more or less airflow I'd rather you just like tell me what's good and stick to it I'm gonna try minimal air flow and see how that goes Devlin gives you a hard hat doesn't Asus goes the rosin cart but still a good tasting cartridge well it's actually like kind of bad to the place garlicky it's not like sweet like that's why I prefer but it's like a very dank weed eat aced it's very heavy on the garlic I'll tell you that it's not even really a GMO taste it's definitely just more straight garlic it's a garlic explosion definitely prefer the rosin cart over this I'm going back to the rosin cart I need something with a better taste [Music] much better I think that's what we're gonna wrap the video you guys super pumped to try this for the first time way too expensive but definitely a cool experience that is so amazing this is probably the coolest thing I picked up in my opinion click like if you enjoyed the video let me know what you thought the coolest thing I got was subscribe for more videos I appreciate you watching my

today's episode we're going to be pressing one ounce of fresh frozen full plan ice water hash we get big yields using the directional flow method as well as show you how I butter the rosin after being pressed [Music] let's go over the items we're going to be using during this week's episode we're going to need parchment paper any brand will do I always go with the unbleached version pressing bags I ordered these online in a custom size to fit my pressing plates perfectly allowing me to maximize the amount that can be pressed at a single time as for micron science I go with the 37 micron because I mainly deal with ice water hash or teeth if you're going to be pressing flour but with ninety micron and I always remember to double bag your product a couple Dobb tools and a set of tweezers lastly obviously the material I'll be pressing you already know from the title we're going to be doing a single press of one ounce the material I'll be pressing is fresh frozen ice water hash this was from one of my previous grows it's a blend of green crack barber bud and Harley Quinn bx4 this is also material that's been freeze-dried I'll be doing a video shortly covering how I made the ice water hash and using my freeze dryer so be sure to hit that subscribe button you can notified when that gets posted as you can see the material is getting pretty sticky once it comes out of the fridge making it very difficult to talk the pressing baked properly [Music] using one of my job tools I packed though ice-water house down into the bag as evenly as possible my hand I give it a good pre-press evening out the material as best as I can at this point the ice water hash has already become warm and it's very sticky not allowing it to be moved around much in the bag [Music] for today's press we're going to be utilizing the directional flow method a benefit of using it is that it allows you to watch the flow during the press you can see the flow from start to finish allowing you to adjust the variables accordingly this becomes very helpful at all stages as you're about to see I forgot to double bag my material which resulted in my bag being unfolded squishing out the ice water hash out the one end this became noticeable immediately allowing me to stop the press right away unfortunately I forgot to record me collecting the material and just putting a second bag over the other [Music] [Music] I stopped the first pressed short not noticing the flow of the rosin still happening [Music] I then folded the pressing bag in half and did a second press giving additional amount of yield [Music] letting the freshly pressed live hash rasa sit for a few minutes allow it to cool carving the rosin eyelet cooler temperature helps with a collection of it using a long-handled dab tool makes the collection of the rosin very easy since the second press was very short I'm going to collect all the rosin together after collecting it all into one patty I like to put it into a glass jar it's process butters the rosin to texture I find more appealing [Music] I simply put the glass shard in between the two plates with the lid tightly screwed on and let it sit for about one hour at 150 degrees Fahrenheit then I open the jar stir the rose and whip it around mix it up place it back in between the plates I had a hundred degrees Fahrenheit for ten hours after the ten hours I collect the rosin out of the jar and place it into a storage container if you enjoyed this video don't forget to hit that like button [Music]", "7_nwzupVrZA": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] aha [Music]", "JEc8S-NYomU": "[Music] all right all right guys we're the first to do this 2 000 milligrams so on the nuxmaster mini there's really the unit was designed to do two different size smashes um it's really designed for travel personal use trade shows um to go and set up heat up quick and uh then extract either a gram nug or three quarters to a gram nug in a piece of parchment paper with no [Music] bag that's one of the presses that it's made to do which we have here in the back some dosey dough and then in the front we have some chronic kush it's also made to do a three and a half gram smash in a three and a half gram bag like this bottle loaded bottle textile um we advocate that extraction method so all of our surface area to pressure calculations on all of our units have been done assuming that you load the bags bottle textile like i said the mini was made for two two different smashes a single nug smash and a piece of parchment with no bag or a three and a half gram bag smash loaded bottle textile now both of these different uh ways of extraction the different weight of extraction are going to require the same pressure because at the end you're going to get the overall same surface area on the extracted material so if you're up to a one gram nug with no bag it's probably gonna be a little bigger so it'll be a little less pressure that you're applying you know um if you go closer towards three quarter of a gram nug with no bag uh it's going to be uh more pressure on that surface area because it's going to be smaller so you'll learn that as you get a unit and you start to extract you'll see the different different results in and out from the different product and whatnot especially if you're on the growing side so we're waiting for this oil to melt over here we thought it'd be a great time to read off some of your youtube comments on the latest videos believe it or not we actually read all of your comments so let's try to keep it positive um latest video was the bubble hash let's see what you guys are saying so connor 4k hey what do you guys do with the already pressed flower as you can see this is exactly what we do we like to make potent thc oil with it and it actually comes out really clean and really high quality don't recommend smoking it i would personally do the oil 10 times out of 10 with the pucks let's see what else we've got here shady 580 cop watch nug smasher is by far the best on the market you'll get your money's worth and then some my small one is paid for itself many times over i really need to get a bigger and bigger one now production is up well shady 580 we got the nug smasher pro ready for you here just give us a call and we'll get this sent over whenever you're ready what else we got better than watching porn nick garden i'd agree with that porn for stoners i dig it complete wash 86 i could see there's a some similarities there so jared stallman how much material did you start with to get that much bubble hash at once was it nugs and trim or just nugs um for that i don't know the exact amount because our friends over at 11 11 cannabis company uh provided us with the bubble hash but it i do know that it was a fresh flower trimmed right off the plant it was still live so if that answers your question let's see what else danny thompson it's like watching da vinci paint i'm seriously considering picking up a nug smasher at harvest time this year i used to be into the whole backyard blasting thing but figure now that i'm growing the garden of my dreams with all my favorite strains why half-ass it when it comes to concentrates that keef was beautiful i'll always have a soft spot for keith full melts i definitely agree with you blasting is cool but rosin is a lot cooler all right i think that's enough for now let me know you guys thought of that we can keep reading them off like i said we read all of your guys's comments so try to keep it positive if you can

joining me for a cannabis extract review I'm really excited that we have cannabis extracts back in Canada and that I have some great friends who are making them growing them with their allowed for plants and sharing them legal rosin how cool is that if you were here from the start of the channel you'll remember that I used to do all my pairings with extracts and only extracts and as soon as legalization happen ox ox 17 20 18 I shifted to reviewing legal cannabis just to make sure that I was playing within all the rules now we've come to a point where we could finally have these craft extracts again and some of these producers from that legacy market I'm lucky to have built friendships with and have them share phenomenal phenomenal products with me which is great I love legalization in Canada super super cool what's the first one we are going to try I have two today we're gonna do two of these new reviews and see how they go I was just in Vancouver for lifting coke conference and I was finally able to meet a very cool gentleman I had done quite a few reviews of his rosin in the past and it was really great to finally meet it's melt season if you're from the show I did a lot of great things about season he has a phenomenal rosin maker it does a lot of collabs with a lot of big wonderful companies in Canada so we have our label says Sunday driver 120 you let's just break that down a little bit so Sunday driver is a genetic from can urato genetics that went to jungle boys and that's where it became really really popular as soon as it was jungle boy then it was one of these really big hype strains and what is the build of it it is fruity pebble OG from alien genetics and then a grape pie and has just all these wonderful fruits and gases and all that great stuff all the Terps that really really like our in here so I've been waiting to open this and make sure that I opened it and could review it so that's the strain we have the producer melt season and then you can see that it says 120 you and if you're not familiar with hashes or Rosen's especially hash Rosen's or hashes that might make absolutely no sense to you and when we're making hash there are silk screen sizes generally they start 190 hundred and fifty and then you get to the Year 120 you and your 90 you then you have a seventy five a sixty a 50 and a twenty five but or seventy three you sorry but that 122 ninety you section of screening is where you get the most mature heads so your 120 you and this is just as I assume this is just a straight 120 you pull of this very specific a lot of people blend their 93 you and their 120 you to get a larger output but very interesting to see the 120 you and I'd really like to do some tasting differences to see if a 93 you would taste different than a 120 you because of the size of the glandular head would be very very interesting experiment to find out so you can see in the bottom we've got a nice wet delicious rosin nice and white absolutely fantastic let's dig in to the nose you can see there I'll get a nice closer video you can see how bright and white it is I believe this is a keyword hash rosin hmm and on the nose the first layer is like this almost creamy herbaceous gas that could only be related to hmm this one's quite confusing cuz it's very complex there's a layer of white flowers there's a layer of gas there's a layer of skunk there's a layer of Rudy miss mmm absolutely delicious super complex which is great and just kind of wet we'll break it up a little with my dab tool here and see if that'll release an aroma so I can really get on point with those mmm if I was gonna relate it to something it would be almost sweet lemongrass petrol some very fresh delicious earth that has some fruits some tree fruits some black and red tree fruits falling in it some plum some blackberry some blueberry but very creamy as well hmm very interesting aromas but a medium plus exaggeration of area it's a medium plus expression of the aroma sorry for my stutter very delicious smells very fresh smells very nice and knew and loved for so I've got my puff go peak here we're gonna load it in the puff Co peak and see how it tastes we'll get that big of a dab in there but a Bing C it is it's a big one but it's not a small one or it's a small one and a big one anyways let's put make sure this is on the right temperature we're gonna put it on medium on green and let's fire it up this is really great to be able to go back and do these types of videos I'm really excited to be putting out more bras in education more hash education because there's a lot of verbiage and vocabulary in there that gets quite confusing so already this lesson on 120 u-verse 93 is fantastic hmm it really translates well I have a quartz insert in here but the flavor really translates well from what I was smelling that creamy lemongrass there's a taste of ginger there's some citrus there's some petrol it's very mouth coating it's very mouth filling and delicious how can you complain about something like that big vapor clouds on green tasty confectionery a little bit of herbs gas everything that you could really ask for in cannabis I guess that's why this genetic is so famous sent to a very famous extractor why it's made its way around the world I totally understand I really like the sunday driver thank you melt season for the wonderful gift I really appreciate it I hope for anybody watching we helped to clarify a few things I should mention that this hash was made from cured cannabis so it's not a live rosin but it's just a hash rosin absolutely fantastic make sure like comment share and most importantly subscribe so you can see all the new videos coming out always working on lots of content I'm really excited to share it with you guys till next time Cheers what's my name what's my name the cannabis Somali yay", "qXQTtjIjZ0U": "alright y'all how everyone's doing good today and in this video we're gonna be talking about rosin more specifically at least in this video we'll kind of talk about half rosin because really rosin is just heat pressure and canvas and really it's not that difficult to explain but when it comes to harsh rosin it's definitely a lot more complex and you can get a lot of different results light rosin with hash rosin you still need good herb but at the same time you can never judge a book by it's cover because at least when it comes to water hash and hash rosin you may not get the best yield if the bud you know looks super try come--and super frosty and all that you make like you may not actually get the best yield for all you know you may get a better yield from a bud that looks okay and it's kind of crazy with hash rosin because this process is so much more complex it actually costs you a lot more as well I mean it depending on the grade of the half-frozen it can be anywhere from like 80 to 140 dollars my obvious that's a big range but with cannabis there's a lot of different qualities so as for the two types of hash that they use for hash rosin it's ice water hash which most which really more than likely I'd say probably 99.9% of the time hash makers are going to be using ice water hash for their hash rosin but the other one is dry sift and that is basically just kind of you know the classic way of getting patched they take a drum that has a screen on the bottom or they have just a big-screen table and they basically just you know break down the buds and they just sift out the hash it's kind of like Keith yeah but in this case because the trichome heads and the glands are a lot more intact and because it's so fresh it's definitely gonna be more like hash because when you pick it up it's definitely gonna be a lot more sticky than it would be if you were to handle this Keith because it's been dried and cured and also until it you guys know what ice water hash is is it's basically putting all of your plant material into a washing machine with ice and water and then it just switches it all around you could some people use Wars or paddles other people use automated systems that just do it all it's itself which honestly is pretty cool I haven't actually seen one in person but these machines are crazy they can go counter clockwise or clockwise and you can set it for it to make two or three revolutions and then go the other way it's it's kind of crazy honestly and with ice water hash you're able to break off those trichome heads a lot more consistently because the way they agitate the buds and the plant material it does it so where it gets a almost perfect every time and then thus going into the filtration process it goes through micron bags which filters out all the plant material and the higher the micron number the more open the holes are and then the lower you go the more tighter than mesh gets there are different hash makers that make a 9bu a 73 and a full-spectrum but more than likely in that full spectrum they're not going to be using that 73 or the 19 I can just tell you that and then if you were really to only get just a single micron hash you really won't get as taste or full-spectrum effect out of it which is the reason why a lot more people like to use full-spectrum hash in order to make their hash process because that taste and the effect translates over so for most full-spectrum hash it's going to be anywhere between 145 to about the 25 range but really those ranges can all depend on the hash maker themselves because the highest amount is really not gonna get you a good yield and the very lowest amount will not get you a good yield at all really because by the time the wash gets down there goes pretty much little to nothing because really between the 70 to 90 micron range is really where you get most of your yield about 70 percent of it and a lot of hash makers they will just take off some of the top ones and the bottom ones and then use kind of everything else in between the reasoning for this is because with the 145 like 150 range even higher the look of it is a lot more green because it has a lot more of the bigger plant material in there so it's obviously not gonna look the best because people are more so looking for a like wider looking crumbly consistency and that's really where you get it from the 70 to 90 range so it's more than likely that they're not including every single micron bag that they use but if they're only doing so in order to maintain quality so like I was saying before how some strains don't really wash as well there's actually a test that some hash makers do it's basically just using a mason jar and putting in a half ounce of flour then ice and water and then kind of mixing it all around if you see the Tri cone heads fall off then you got some good but but if you see them kind of breaking off or the stock kind of breaking off halfway then it's not typically what you're looking for and of course most of the time these hash makers are going to be using live products and live basically means as soon as a flower is harvested they throw it right into a freezer basically or they just freeze it at sub-zero temperatures so it keeps all of the terpenes it keeps all of the cannabinoids and everything else intact as much as possible because if you were to just let it sit out and cure you will be losing most of that taste and the effect so I didn't even realize that there were even more forms of rosin there is a mechanical separation which basically is still rosin they've just extracted some THC a crystals from or they extracted the THC a which turned into THCA crystals and there you go so it's almost looks like a nice like sappy rosin with some diamonds in there which is kind of crazy I'll probably show you guys a picture somewhere because I got it I got this off of High Times as far as this article goes so so I thought the High Times for interviewing for pretty knowledgeable hash makers and providing us with this knowledge and the other method is called jar tech which basically makes the rosin look like a sauce and it's kind of crazy because I don't even know that I mean I mean know that rosin can come in different consistencies like that and then for you to make a rosin and then turn it into a sauce that's pretty cool so I think that's pretty much all that I wanted to talk about at least for rosin anyway if you guys can get your hands on it definitely try it out it is it can't well I mean it can be pretty expensive like I said it can be anywhere from 80 to 140 done 40-plus dollars so if you are able to find some for a good price hopefully not too cheap because you know sometimes the prices are too good to be true but you're able to find some good half-frozen definitely go out there and go try it and I'm also not promoting any underage or you know illegal use but yeah but you know if you found this video helpful you don't be sure to like subscribe comment do all that good stuff and actually today is Friday so every Friday we actually do a canned verse Asian at 4:20 p.m. Pacific Standard Time where me and the community have a conversation about the various topics that are the cannabis industry as well as they asked me their cannabis related questions and me as you are maybe cannabis consultant will do my best to answer them it's already all if I don't see you in a few hours then I'll see you on the next video juice you [Music]", "Wwy0yvQkMO0": "[Music] what a guy's welcome to the CCC I'm Shane and I'm Danny we're back again for another concentrate review today we are checking out some rosin from 7-10 laughs and this stuff looks fire man the rosin we've been getting our hands on has been super fire and it's a treat today we've got the doctor ladybug GMO flower to compare directly to one of the best representations of the concentrate that's a pretty rare that we get the chance to sometimes it's like we get a certain type of hats whether it be a particular strain and then we're able to try the flower sometime down the line or we may have tried it previously it's pretty rare to have a sample of some flour and some concentrate of the exact same cultivar for us you know lately but we have been smoking this GMO a lot we've been thinking about doing a review for you guys like we just haven't gotten around to do it yet we're good but we figured we kind of throw a little mini review of this in with this GMO rosin that was press Peron does it say what micron bubble hash this was I don't believe that I assume it's like nine here ones one or 73 so basically GMO the strain itself is a cross between chem dog and Girl Scout cookie as you guys know if you've been watching this channel for any length of time that we are huge chem dog fans this particular Cross Lanes super heavily on the chem dog side which is something I like hold on when you look at the smell the structure it's definitely super kendo Oh God that is crazy every time I dab GMO lately I'm just like what the hell it's like it's almost like it gives you a little heartburn it's so pungent I didn't think we could give you heartburn in a good way but it's just got that like back in the throat huh oh wait it's like a real really big it's not like a plunging like sour like fruity or like a diesel II smell it's very like dick and musk it almost like coffee you know coffee is like a really big yeah smell but this is more like a Sharpie turb kinda like I mean down there's a lot of hints of a lot of different kind of complex smells and flavors and Terps going on in here but I've been a huge fan of this weed since the first time I tried it and any time I can get my hands on a good batch like this dr. ladybug I usually do you got to try that robot really high but it's almost like that it's a little bit much a very high but it's not a bad jittery it's just like that I need to reduce them you know say like I need to go be active it's very cerebral in the head that it's also got a big body part it's almost yes it's definitely gonna lean heavier on the indica side in the normal sense of like what you think indica means as far as being relaxing superbee this strain is super good for pain relief but it's not like a knockout smoke it's not gonna you know make you super sleepy it's functional but it does have a lot of the good traits that we tend to think of as traditional yeah indica traits as far as the good pain relief appetite stimulant for me personally this has been a great like all-around daytime throughout the day any time of day textmode yeah honestly yeah again I hate the whole indica sativa thing kinda as far as from a marketing standpoint because I like like I said I like to judge everything as I hit it this one's honestly hit me like right in minute like you said it's a it's a everyday smoke morning noon or night to me it's pretty it resembles a hybrid to me I don't know what they're really calling it I realize it's kind of the best of both worlds yes it's the best of all worlds got me very creative but not too sleepy not too jittery so yeah I mean I love the high on it honestly it's really nice this stuff came to us as like a really tacky shatter almost and it buttered up from over 90 yeah those guys can see the close-ups it started off completely translucent thank you like you would see it pretty much right after it was pressed you know it stayed temperature controlled and you know they did a good job getting that from beginning processed the way they wanted to live it to the end consumer and then what we do with it on our end is on us yeah you know we kept it out we didn't put in the fridge or whatever it's completely buttered up now but when we took the close-ups yesterday a look incredible we goofed it guys we does n't matter literally this whole of joggers getting smoked in less than what 12 hours right you know so I'm not really too concerned with it but yeah I can already tell by smelling this it's an exaggerated version of that I'm expecting it to taste like an exaggerated version of that we'll find out yeah I'm gonna go out and I'm popping this jar on the dr. ladybug GMO so and I wanted to bring up that it smells very garlicky and I know that there's like garlic breath up there I know there's garlic cookies and others GMO cookies I'm not really quite sure they all smell they're very similar but this right here is the loudest and most garlic theme of them all this shit's got me super scrambled but this right here is the most garlicky all mo raw it doesn't just taste like that smells o3 airs I got even a smoke kind of smelled like that smoke smells amazing a little treat I couldn't hold back I'm gonna go home and we're going on longer for this right here so this is the kind of [ __ ] I don't care what the [ __ ] haters out there say this is the [ __ ] that deserves a little review oh so far this is so far the bug right here it's it's definitely you know I think it leaves more on the chem side it's definitely got that dirty feet funky fuelie fuming I don't know the best way to describe is just that funk that canvas where I got the word pom-pom when I yeah funky weed it usually has some Cameron this stuff this straight funky dirt I can we're getting the really good Kennedy from up north and then they kind of 91 chem over it's Ann Curry's the creme Buchanan for a while when we first got our medical carts back in the day that's definitely what I look for I'm looking for those nostalgic funky root Bewley crazy gassy Terps with the chemicals that takes me back to that a day you know and with this weed right here the reason we've been smoking this on us lately is because it's exactly what I want is this as far as the body smell it takes just the overall enjoyment when I smoke this yeah this is the exact same thing alright guys sorry gonna take a little halftime break there I guess this stuff the buzz on it is a little more strong than we were intending it's kind of like kind of like an OG it just kind of keeps going up and you don't know where the ceilings gonna be because I'm pretty high right now I take no more dad and then we're gonna rate this [ __ ] oh you're going in for that second Devon yeah I just got this so long I got a good one on a second one yeah it's a rarity for you these days I'd really like to take two in one video especially two bangers so that should tell you guys right there's something about this [ __ ] right here some day it's like the type of stuff were like you're already where you want to be but you end up I'm just smoking more just because you want to taste it I just need to flavor again and the flavors that's a real thing right sometimes you smoke because you want to smoke you want the field you know you want to feel I might as well let's just be honest yeah but then there's some times where you're already where you exactly where you want to be and I still want to smoke more it's because you just want to taste it I I'm stealing your gone I'm gonna take one of these blowing it up with two nice well my timers hitting this so we're just gonna race the music up in the window yeah this stuff is really smooth though it doesn't make it expands your arms and it makes you cop a little bit if you know what's on my first step there wasn't much of a cop this stuff is really smooth for some rosin so I'm digging feel like there's been a lot of tins being given out lately yes what do you think it's another one yeah goodness I don't do up the DJ Khaled oh no then another ten honestly there's some stiff competition on this string and I'm gonna say that I've had one representation that was a little bit better it was the Papa Berkeley it wasn't rosin but it was GMO it was full milk but it tasted just a little better than this I'm not gonna lie and there's some stiff competition so you know I feel like our ratings have to get a little bit stiffer I'm giving this one a nine point five everything's tens the flavor just to be a a bit more little more that stuff I remember that as some of the best bubble hat I've seen this year sure it's crazy it's crazy a time football mashup in this browser but I promise you if you tried both of them I think you would agree and yeah I don't know man I haven't find I would like to see someone make yeah I don't know if you could make better rosin from that bubble than this right here you know I'm saying yeah this to me is about you it's about as good as it gets because then the flavor on this is already crazy to me and the flavor on this was just like a slightly more exaggerated cleaner version of this and I like this dream because it it's one of those strains that tastes almost exactly the way it smells so like kind of gives you that he like ride the whole progress I've like smelling it breaking it down packing it is smoking it and it's like you get the smell and then you get the taste and there's like brings it full circle bias in there it's personal opinion all right for sure I tried that at cauliflower and it was the first time I actually dabbed GMO extract that could be playing on it could be the first time I just got that crazy GMO term and extract form but you know what this stuff is amazing I'm still giving this stuff a 95 percent rating so that's pretty good they built a and this stuff is awesome pickups in 710 labs now and they are killing it right Sutton standards definitely so I'm seeing from you know watching them out in Colorado when we were out there and you know seeing what they were doing out there and then watching what the way they've been able to transition out here and what they've done in the last like year and a half two years has been really cool to watch nothing up some 710 labs for sure yeah and we're far frozen they definitely smoke graves I think so I mean we're definitely going to have to get great be with them I love them linked up with smoked tons of curve GBP Swisher's all day do all the stuff down there that you're supposed to do right now like like comment subscribe turn on notifications hit the bill do that little thing yeah and let us know what your favorite purple strain of all time let's do it right now brilliant I'll be back next week with another one of these doing the same thing yeah same table same guys whatever different we though what's your name Shane mine Dan mm-hmm later see you know what just a plain row always give my day on all night but I'm the running back jet and you know I'm gonna run all know we have fun for the right price turning the Friday night we're going 18 dummy to the sunrise no wise from the dank smoke but I run a reserve with my tank for what we just trying to have some fun", "TyuAC616qCM": "[Music] how's it going YouTube I'm always placing here back with another video today is going to be a strain review and for review today we actually have some wedding cake so without further ado as you guys can see I'm in nature here actually just in a little forest near my house so hopefully you guys enjoyed the scenery today but anyways let's get right into the review it is wedding cake so obviously we're gonna give you the genetics of wedding cake which is Girl Scout cookies crossed with a cherry pie so that's what makes a wedding cake and let's jump right into this review basically wedding cake was bred by cookie fam genetics they bred all those famous hype strains like Girl Scout cookies gelato and a bunch of other stuff so yeah without further ado I can't give you guys the looks of these buds because I don't have a nut I will show a lot of pictures at the end of the video so I'll give you the smell of this wedding cake which is something very very unique it has like a very just dank doughy vanilla cookie scent in my opinion it's like really really really good it's very hard to describe when you crack open the jar it's kind of like a doughy vanilla just dank muskiness that just hits your nose it almost smells like when you're baking cookies or like croissants or something like it's really crazy but yeah so I'm gonna give you guys basically the looks on the looks of these buds were just dense frosty just rock-hard just amazing beautiful nugs I'm gonna show you guys all the screen shot at the end of the video a quick tip for you guys if you guys want to learn how to light a joint properly this is my way of doing it you obviously want to get the end lit get a cherry going and then just spark it up all right so as you guys can see this joint is burning nice and white the ash this cannabis was flushed very well the grower is actually fat farm craft cannabis Co I'll put the link in the description and you guys can check out his Instagram an amazing amazing grower he actually grew this zombie curse that I reviewed not too long ago but let's get back to the review for the wedding cake so as soon as you pull this it has like thick dense milky smoke but the flavor is like I said it's a doughy vanilla kind of cushiness like it's it's very unique I've never had a strain that tastes like this or smells like this it almost has like like a baked goods kind of reminiscent taste that just coats your mouth like I said very vanilla a very musky dankey cookie just overall an amazing amazing strain another thing I want to let you guys know as you guys can see I'm wearing my portugal jersey let me know who you guys are going for in the World Cup it's been an amazing tournament so far and I can't wait to see who wins I have a feeling it's gonna be an underdog team but we'll see but yeah good luck to your team in World Cup as well let me know who you guys are cheering for in the comments as you guys can see nice white ash beautiful color nice resin ring going right around the joint it won't be able to focus sorry guys I'm using the front-facing camera I actually have my phone lodged on a like a broken tree branch right now so that's how I'm filming this going woo but for the effects of wedding-cake it is a very very very nice hybrid strain it's an indica dominant hybrid I would probably say an 80/20 75 15 or 75 25 kind of like something like that very very heavy just hit you right behind the eyes you just start getting very relaxed and mellow and just stress-free and it's just an amazing amazing full body relaxation no pain in your body like I said if you had any depression or anxiety it would just completely wipe it away and just coat you with an amazing feeling of just being uplifted and happy and just in a good mood and like you know an overall good enjoyable high but at the same time like you're stoned - it's really nice Wow another person's walking by right now so just might see a dog or something in the video yeah I'm kind of in like it's kind of like a ravine kind of path or bike path kind of thing it's not really like a forest or like a park it's kind of a weird area but either way who gives a [ __ ] I'm just smoking a joint anyways if you guys didn't know kind of Canada actually legalized cannabis and it's going to be coming October 17 2018 so go canada baby so I'm gonna get into the ratings out of ten for this wedding cake for the looks out of ten this is a very very nice-looking bud big frosty dense nugs I would have to say out of ten I would say in 8.5 out of 10 very beautiful nugs frosty dense smelly sticky so that's for the looks the smell the smell is also an eight and a half out of ten it's not the best smelling strain in the world but it's very unique and it's almost kind of like one of those dessert kind of strains that you smoke after dinner right before you hit bed or you know just when you're chilling watching a movie it's kind of like a treat when you smoke a joint of wedding cake like how it makes you feel it's so amazing so that's for the looks for the smell is also an 8.5 out of 10 look smell taste the taste comes through exactly like the smell it has that vanilla doughy cushion muskiness that just coats your mouth and just sits there I would have to say it's pretty unique there's not a lot of strains that taste like this there's a few maybe cookie strains that might have that dough anus in there so for the taste I would also have to give it an 8.5 out of 10 what else can I say look smell taste the effects the effects of wedding cake are in my opinion really really really good for an indica dominant hybrid it's exactly what I want I'm clear-headed I'm able to speak properly without stuttering without feeling foggy but at the same time I'm very relaxed and like very stoned and you know very mellow right so it's an amazing feeling I don't think you can really get better than that for indica hybrid effects in my opinion a great daytime smoke and nighttime smoke whenever you want you can even wake and bake if you actually want to I won't really put you right to bed but yeah overall for wedding cake I'm gonna have to give it a solid 8.5 out of 10 it's just that a really well-balanced strain it hits all the marks looks smell tasting effects it's really dank you know the Terps are there so in my opinion it's a very solid strain make sure you guys can get a verified cut of wedding cake if you guys are looking to pick this up so yeah this has been I'm always blazing's review of wedding cake hopefully you guys enjoyed it and I'll see you guys in the next video have a bake day guys [Music] [Music]", "LOElLD68v8s": "get a good life [Music] [Music] we're back we're doing another press with some xxx og we're at stage one move it overflow this is the quarter pound sum triple XL g flour rosin just straight flour we're only at stage two stead of two more stages to go we're at 2,300 pounds of pressure we're running this at 109 degrees or under 90 degrees we just breached up to stage three we're still pressing we're gonna scoop this to collect or again where if you guys just joined us one of bras endeavor so we're at stage three and counting each stage is about 53 seconds the liquify time was 30 seconds 160 second total stages total cycle 45 46 thousand 46,000 pounds on the on the game we just went up to stage four so we're at 7,000 pounds of force which equivalent to about a hundred and forty thousand pounds 75 tons of pressure under a hundred and thirty one hundred under 130 square inches of surface area it looks like this is definitely going to reach what the test was the test tested at twenty nine percent return and I'm pretty sure that this quarter pound is going to throw about 25 28 grams let's see we'll see it's almost off the parchment paper under there when we are at Stage four we're fitting it fish finishing up this full cycle you guys just joined us is more we're here at a stiched area here shooting a function video this is what the will be you're going on YouTube the self collecting we're at ninety three percent ninety three percent runoff so you got eight percent maximum amount of oil being stuck within your your your parchment paper so there's no need for scraping it's almost all self collected yeah we just finished the cycle we're back at home so let's pull this out it's for what have we got in the oven here what do we got okay that's quite a lot of oil I mean that's a quarter pound JK there was a twenty eight grams per bag for bags let me lift this up and show you guys what it looks like [Music] it's just these pouches every single time they come out like this", "naqozVZyhNI": "what's going on ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for tuning back to the channel this is captain Riggs bringing you guys an update here in the flour room flour room a actually which is the kind led we have two XL 1000s here and of course we are running the wedding kicks train which is 11 wedding kicks trains and 5 gallon pots aerated pots of course running the cocoa nutrients so here we are you guys this is finally the day that we've been wanting on harvest day overall I'd say things came out pretty good nog sizes are pretty decent and of course as always quality's on point we've got a little bit of light nice and say light well light bleaching let's finish that sentence yup I got like bleaching of course that's a courteous of kind LED like I said we got two of them here you know kind led of course even though these plants are you know of course well over 18 inches or more of course still light reaching so they need more maybe I should probably over like 23 24 inches so we'll see how the next run goes but aside from that of course we have some hewing going on with with the purple of course it looks pretty definitely looks pretty temps have been dropping here so it's kind of giving it this beautiful look but here we are you guys this is it overall I'd say things are looking really nice I wanted to challenge myself this round why because well last run so here we have one one light basically that's the doing of one light and then if I go ahead and come to this side where you kind of see the doing of this light and then a little bit of cross lighting happening right here so what I wanted to do you guys was challenged myself why because last run I had 15 or 16 I can't remember of course you guys can go back and see I had 15 or 16 of these plants in these 5 gallon pots and I had a third light right there and the results came out to you know the bright around two and a half pounds very disappointing even though you know it's not bad by any means I certainly could have been a lot worse however about two and a half pounds I mean I'm expecting a minimum of a pound per light so what I wanted to do this round was to kind of see you know these lights these kinds they have their pluses they have their minuses I'm gonna make a video on these later on however for now hey guys I think I did it I think I'm gonna be able to at least get about the same if not maybe more maybe a little bit less it's hard to tell I can never I'm always a little bit more optimistic than I should be I think but you know it is what it is I'm happy about this I'm happy with the overall results with 4 2 lights I think that's gonna you know be pretty good as far as grams per watt and I'm gonna actually try to keep you guys more in the loop as far as like final bugs what they look like the smell I want to try out a whole dry trim versus wet trim video I'm gonna make of that here in the next couple days too so overall I'm gonna try to make sure that these plants you know get the best treatment as far as curing so we can get the most out of them but giving the stage that they're in right now things are looking really nice cocoa of course as being the medium that's gonna of course help us make make things a little bit faster you know hydroponics that's controversial but I like to think it does overall you guys things are really really good though oh very happy so what do you guys think post it in the comment below of course I'm gonna make a video to update you guys all on this but overall what do you guys think is the final wait let me do this a little hand this with for you guys two lights kinda led you know in the video it actually looks a good decent amount of blood oh goodness what will it be what will it be look at that beauty though fire that is some failure let's go whoo all right you guys I'm gonna go ahead and get into this I'm excited I'll keep you guys updated as we move forward and we'll see how things go post comments in the bullet and the in the below I in the comment section below let me know what you guys think is gonna be the final wait for this to lights 11 plants wedding cake string cannon nutrients KOCO 5 gallon aerated pots you know beneficial bacteria a little bit of co2 let's go captain rigs out to the next one guys peace", "Ra6Dn9tq7ks": "[Music] hey guys what's up welcome back so here we are today we have a fantastic video planned for you and I know this because it was one of the most watched videos on my original channel and is above and beyond by far the most requested to be re uploaded here on the new channel but instead of doing that we're gonna clean up a few of the little mistakes that were in the first video and just make it a little better and we're just gonna make a whole new video so before I go any further I'm making this video for educational documentary and safety purposes only I do not support promote condone or glorify any dangerous or illegal activities be smart about this guys this is simply a PID controlled heated plate system nothing more nothing less so again this is well within YouTube's Community Guidelines and does not glorify promote condone or support dangerous or illegal activities so the DIY PID heated plate system we all know that most of the confusion is wiring the whole thing up with the PID so if you're just here for that look in the table of contents at the very beginning of this and this will give you a timestamp to that point otherwise let me go over the components real quick what they are what they do kind of how they their job and also how to search for them because I'm gonna give you Amazon links to everything you see here will have an Amazon link even specific drill bits and taps if you don't have that stuff already but if an Amazon link goes out I want you to understand what this actually is so you can search for it on your own or something along those lines so not any further let's let's get into the components here what this consists of mostly is the PID the relay the thermocouple heaters aluminium plates a mounting system and a box to put it all into as well as some wires connectors and m5 screws and some really basic stuff again so everything will be down below the main component itself is the PID this is the brains of the operation this is what's going to control power to and from the heaters to turn them on and off to then heat the plate steers at higher temperature so this guy control your temperature and basically again be the brains of it it's gonna do that in tandem with two things that are supplied in the kit that I have here this is an Inc bird 106 ITC 106 VH and this is basically good for US and European it does a hundred to two hundred fifty volts very common very easy to work with anyway it comes in a package with a thermocouple ready wired up already has your terminal connectors and a quarter twenty screw end that we will put into the plate side as well as it comes with a 40 amp relay now you can use the 25 amp relay and save yourself five bucks but yeah it really doesn't matter things are so cheap and either way it's well within it and this is what's gonna actually cut the power according to the PIDs signal now again I believe most the confusion of the build will come from wiring that up even though it is very simple we'll go over that next down the line is the heaters now these are the these are and were the most challenging to obtain in the original build and that's because they come from China these are called cartridge heaters now that term cartridge heater is what you guys need to know when these links go out of stock or I miss some or this or that so this specifically is a hundred watt AC cartridge heater so that means it's going to use AC or alternate current power which is what you have in your walls and it's going to use about a hundred watts of 100 watts which is 100 watts of heat in this case so if you can't find this specific one they make 120 watt ones they make 200 watt once they make 40 watt ones they make 80 watt ones they'll all work but I'm specifically recommending the hundred watt ones for the ease and compared to the original build I believe people are stocking these stateside now and we will be able to get them much quicker so anyway very simple cartridge heater cartridge heater is your search term and that's what's going to get you to the right product so next we have the plates themselves now these are the these are the bronze of the build the PID was the brain these are the well I guess technically the presses but this is what's going to be heating up and actually applying pressure to whatever you have under here so what these are are these are three by five plates now on the original one I did a big 6 by 6 plate build and you can still do something like this this build will still work it actually the plate size is more or less irrelevant at this point what you're going to be searching for is bar stock aluminum and again this is a three a three inch by one inch by five inch long profile so when you're searching for a loom aluminum bar stock online eBay Amazon whatever it may be what you're actually searching for is this width and height so again this is one inch by three inch and then I have it in a five inch long segment here and I have two of these now the links I provide you to Amazon or to a supplier named stoner metals he has some really good profiles available both 3x5 style and bigger five by five six by six style usually impairs fantastic shipping I got these plates these ones like two years ago for like 18 or fourteen dollars shipped and I got my big 6x6 ones for under $30 shipped to my door so I really support him and his his little thing anyway any aluminum bar stock that fits your your needs or your profile will work now with these plates also comes a little bit of machining we have to machine some holes in here for the heaters to slide in we have to put a ground and we often the thermocouple spot right in the center there so we can know the temperature of the plates now this is very simple I'm not here to show you how to drill and tap but I highly suggest you have a drill press for this though it can be done with a hand drill it's not ideal and for this build I'm going to be using four heaters two in each plate and what that's gonna do is that's essentially going to guarantee me a very quick heat up time with the first six by six build it was a little slow combining one heater and massive plates now we're completing two heaters into smaller plates I've already tested this the heat up time is like two minutes it's awesome now to mount this to the press we've done the same thing as we did in the old build and this is the floor flange this is a one and one and one quarter inch floor flange for plumbing um it may look a little more familiar to you guys with the wings on the side here it's a nice circular floor flange what I did is because you have to get the one and a quarter to make it go over most sized Rams check you might be able to get away with one but nonetheless it's wider than these narrow plates you see this this half would hang off here which is totally fine if you don't want to dine this off you can leave it on there it's just aesthetics at that point on two screws is more than enough so anyway I marked it cut it off so it fits on top of the plate really really nice two screws m5s to mount them on there very simple very easy and it goes I'm very quick the last part is we have to set the set screws and this is what actually kind of pinches the RAM and holds it still in the first build I had a collar that went up and you can see it was kind of big and bulky well we don't necessarily need this extension and we drilled right through the collar that's already built in on the floor flange and it worked fantastic m5 screws right through there again I used a drill press but be careful if you're not and five pinched in there very nice last of the major components of the build is this project box and this is in the first build I used a basic junction box from Home Depot anything that's gonna clean up your build flow work even if you had a wood box there's nothing of temperature or anything as long as your connections are good you can make a wood box but this is a ABS plastic project box from bud Industries is very cheap it was like seven or eight dollars shipped perfect size really cleans up the build and all we had to do was machine a forty seven millimeter by forty seven millimeter square so the PID can slide right up in there just like so and then two holes on the back so we can have power come into this box and then power go out of this box to the plates that's it and it closes out very nicely and in the end will look very good next to your plates so in the end you should have a system that looks somewhat like this very clean ready to go and mount on to any press system that you have for a build like this I suggest six tons to twelve tons you don't need definitely don't need more than the 12-time but if it's a cheap twelve ton press it's probably really around ten or eight so you get the picture anyways six to twelve tons for this build the most you're gonna need you have bigger plates you can go twelve to twenty you have smaller plates and go less you get the picture lastly there are some key components here we have sixteen you can get away with eighteen but a 16-gauge power cord one or two of them works fantastic once you can actually just bring in power from the wall very simply to your box and then another one so you can actually connect the plates from the box that do carry power with a nice jacket instead of just running wires you can run a jacketed power cord that's a little more protected so you have to go buy any extra sheeting or anything like that and if you're really in a pinch you can take one eight foot power cord and cut it in half and you have a four foot power cord and a four foot extension a little jacketed extension run there last couple little components here we have some peach I believe these are PG 11s yes PG 11 gland connector or cable gland connectors only need two of them very simple and then we're gonna need a handful I believe it's five or six I use WAGO connectors but you can use a wire nut you can use any kind of quick connector wire connector or you can solder but anyway if we're gonna need about six of them I'm gonna recommend the three packs they work very very well but if you happen to have like a variety pack with the five packs for the twos they were will work for somebody you need a lot of more threes than anything without further ado let's get into the wiring let's talk about the schematic the wiring and then we will I'm going to do it all for you outside right out here in the open and then we're gonna do it you're gonna watch me shove it in the box because it's hard to show you shoving it in the box because there's that that technique of shoving it in the box you got to make it fit and that parts not pretty but we will show you up show you in a nice open space where all the wires go explain the diagram let's get into this okay guys so let's wire this up let me talk about the wiring real quick that will actually wire it up so what we are looking at here is one of my beautiful diagrams if you would rather look at the instructional version it'll get you to the same place so go ahead and the instruction version I believe it's on page 4 the instructions looks like this right here or if you forget that one you can turn your PID sideways and the 106 VH has it right there on the side all the terminals that are gonna get connected and what they are but lucky for you guys you have me and I have created this beautiful drawing see there's a lot of colors I think you want may understand what's actually here but these wires are what obviously are confusing so before we go too far let's actually check out what the wire what the colors of these wires represent what they're doing and kind of where they come from on this diagram so we have both AC and DC current going on in this setup it is mostly AC there's only a little bit of DC but here's how they're all represented the black solid lines the big black solid lines will be the AC hot and that's going to correspond to when we actually do get our power cords we have a black wire that is our AC hot now the next one is in silver because we're on white paper this is actually gonna represent our white wire being our AC neutral and you can see the third one here green is ground whether we're on DC AC doesn't matter green or yellow will always beat your ground and they can be the same after that we're gonna have a little bit of a DC like I said we only have a little DC action and that's represented by some dotted lines and we're gonna use red and blue so we don't confuse the black that's AC hot so dotted red is DC positive dotted blue DC negative and like I said green ground is always going to be ground whether we're grounding a DC connection an AC connection it is always grant and lastly I have the thermocouple as a blue and red combined little solid line and that's because right here the thermocouple comes as one piece it is only at the last two and a half inches here that it splits off into its positive and negative and they clearly it comes clearly marked as blue and red so when we get to that it'll be very very clear so is why the thermocouple itself is a little different because it's technically DC but it's generating its own current so and as you can see has everything that it's going to go on we got the PID up here got the relay here got the plates here got thermocouple and some wiring in here we have cable glands essentially coming into the box here so this is the full set up bam bam what the hell's actually going on right so it all starts with this all starts with the PID and the entire premise of the whole the whole operation is on the back of the PID and as you can see right here you got some screw terminals you've got one two three four five six seven eight nine ten you got eleven and twelve up the gut but those aren't even used so don't worry about it but that obviously correlates very nicely to my drawings of the PID so one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one two three four five six seven eight nine ten and as you can see from this overhead view we have Liars coming in and out of it let's explain that so all these are as screw terminals you unscrew them you put your wire or your connector on there screw it down it's tight good to go okay so we're only going to be using six out of those ten or actually technically twelve but six out of the twelve screw terminals on the back of the PID here we're gonna be using numbers three and four for the thermocouple three for the negative of the thermocouple four for the positive of the thermocouple when you're using terminals six and eight six for the negative DC to the relay and eight for the positive DC to the relay and lastly is numbers nine and ten nine we're going to use neutral alternating current and ten is going to be the hot from the alternating current so this nine and ten this is your power from the wall if that's the the easiest way to to realize what AC power is just the power from the wall that's cool how about we we wire it all up so start off I got the P you sit in there we got the relay sitting right here we have power coming into the box right here and we have connectors on it ready to go and then we will deal with the power out in just a second so just as the diagram goes let's start with the easy one so you kind of guys see you guys kind of get the hang of it and that's what the thermocouple see it's all one wire except for the very end it breaks out and just as I told you we have negative or blue going to Terminal three we will put them in and screw it down and then we have positive coming out to Terminal four so let's get that under the terminal connector there and screw it down secure so now just like the drawing shows wires three and four blue and red coming out the side the actual PID has wires three and four and blue and red coming off the side let's just do the same for the rest of it the negative DC goes to right underneath sometimes it's easier to turn it upside down so screw terminal falls push the wire in secure it down same for getting a positive DC and while we're at it let's just connect these two you can see on the diagram we have six going to terminal six of the PID going to terminal 4 or negative of the relay and eight going to three let's do that right now take your black go to terminal 4 of the relay screw it down nice and secure take six or excuse me take eight or your positive from be PID and do it to the positive of the relay nice now we're really moving along guys we got the thermocouple connected and we have the relay connected to the PID lastly we're gonna need to get power from this wall plug power here see the other end of it's at the wall comes out wall plug power here when you get power from here to the PID and we're we are going to do that with a black and white wire going from its corresponding power to be correct terminals so for the black wire which is the hot or the the actual power wire here that is going to go to number 10 technically the polarity of this alternating does not matter because for you guys in Europe you have 240 volts and this works for that as well too but for the sake of sanity here let's mmm keep it consistent because what we do run through the relay is going to matter so the neutral AC wire or the white wire is going to run to Terminal nine so now just like we did we have a white a black and a green we're gonna connect the black from terminal nine to the black from the wall connected and secured we're gonna connect the white from terminal nine to the white coming in from the wall power in secure very nice very easy well the next step now is we need to get power running out of this box and we're going to do that you could easily do that by just linking from these open connectors straight over to your the power cord jumper coming in and that's what we're gonna do for most of it except for the hot wire so before we go any further let's just do that we're gonna take the AC going out or the power out to the plates and we're connected to the white of the power in directly BAM and we are going to connect the grounds together now this is green to green and the only connection now the last link between power going power coming in from the wall and power going out to the plates is this hot line and this is where the real a comes in the relay is going to interrupt coming from power in to power out so we're going to do that by connecting from power in so power in right here we have this terminal it's going connect connect to the relay they can connect anywhere can connect to two or terminal one doesn't matter that's going to connect to Terminal four now in my drawing Terminal two so now we have power coming in and it goes to the PID but it also takes a stop here the hot line takes a stop here at the relay now we not take the oh the last open terminal here have the last open terminal on the relay terminal one we're gonna put a wire from here sure and this goes to from the relay all the way to power going out to the plates so now we have a full connection within the relay we have DC power signaling it when to turn on and off and we have the actual power break down below now guys we are to the point that all of this would be inside of this box and at this point only tooth well two things are gonna come out that'll be our two cable glands and one is our power going into it it's actually not coming out is going in and that's right here this goes in and stays there well coming out is obviously the AC power but in addition to that we are going to buddy it up you can go ahead and unwrap your thermocouple now and this is going to run out the back of the plates as well so from here on the thermocouple lot once it reaches outside the box the thermocouple line and the jacketed extension carrying alternating current power to your plates can be looked at at one wire or package of liars okay so this is all inside the box like here we have everything hooked up we have our power coming in you can see this nice little stubby just for demonstration so you see this is would be from the wall going in and like I just talked about you can consider what's coming out as one set of wires because out of this cable gland we have the jacket extension and the thermocouple coming out one so they will both run to the plates and at the other end of them you have the thermocouple quarter-twenty screw that's ready to go into your plates and you have the three wires of the jacketed extension exposed again black for hot white for neutral green for ground so we can set this off to the side now save that for the last connection and what we're gonna move on to is the plates and you can see a little demonstration here but I'd rather I'll just show you so what we have here are the four heater holes you can see these four main holes one two three four so two on each plate are the heater holes that's gonna be done with the twenty one sixty four-bit just bored in there no threads no nothing so that's that's really nice and easy because the heaters just drop in if you want to use a little bit of paste at thermal paste or anything at the very tip to just kind of give it a little suction they can but these should be securely in there really aren't gonna go anywhere once you get your your press and plate system mounted up nicely so we have the top plate we have the bottom plate the center hole what you're looking at here in the top plate because you only need it on one plate because we only have one PID system here is the thermocouple and the reason we're gonna do it on the top plate is because heat rises so this is gonna be the hottest point if we put the the temperature at the hottest point you know anything that's below it should kind of err on the lower side so say you set it to say 200 degrees you know maybe the bottom plates not a perfect 200 degrees but it's like a 190 195 that's a better error than being hotter than you anticipate it for the non measured plate so the thermocouple that's pretty simple as well - that is literally just a screw right in and make sure you torque it down just nice and tight unless you have a a blind tap that bores all the way down you're not gonna get it perfectly flush so this is where I suggest just a little bit of thermal grease or thermal compound in the bottom of the hole so there's no air pocket down there and the temperature matching will be as accurate as possible then lastly what we have is the ground and this is what's gonna make sure that if anything were to happen if any short or anything were to you know arc or anything this is gonna run back trip your circuit breaker and everything's going to be just fine so what I have is I have two green wires here and I put terminal connectors on them you don't have to you can just kind of wrap the wire around the screw but terminal connectors make it obviously cleaner in a little a little nicer these are just getting screwed right into the plates so I have some m5 screws that we've gotten ready here and these will get terminal connected right under there now this is a step I believe some of you guys may try to skip technically the press will work just fine without it but this is a safety step so I suggest you do it and do it correctly so all this is doing again is making sure that if there were any short or anything this would run back and rip your circuit breaker so so now we need to hook up the the wires in so what you'll notice here is there are two wires coming out of each heater ones gonna act as a hot and one is going to act as a neutral now there's no indication it does not matter you could switch these at any point and it's still gonna run fine it's just a resistance heater in there so we're just gonna grab them randomly and so for the top and bottom plate gonna take two wires just grab two wires give them a little twist together and we are gonna put them inside one terminal so one terminal two wires going into one terminal of this way go three connector now if you have a way go five connector for this multi heater build here would be ideal but just double-check that both wires are securely in that Wego terminal you're good to go now take two random wires from the top plate or the bottom plate excuse me the other plate whichever the other plate and do the same thing and insert that into the next one on that same connector again double-check that they're secure by tugging on each wire so now we have four wires connected to this this one way go one from each heater that leaves four wires left out for wires remaining and we're gonna do the same thing but to a separate connector so start with I suggest when you're twisting them twist them from the same plate that way we can separate them later so take the two that are on the top plate here twist them together just a slight twist we'll put them both into their single terminal of the way go and again make sure they're secure and now we'll take the remaining wires from the top plate and do the same thing so we're gonna twist it together right here and stick it in the remaining or itten in the center there's actually two remaining excuse me again always check to make sure this is secure because this is AC power this is where we want to be safe so if you have the juego fives use them here anyway now we have one more to do we're gonna take these grounds and we're gonna connect these two grounds together with a juego three as well okay so now what we're looking at here thank you that in your view a little bit more is we have three juego connectors here which correspond beautifully to the three ends of your jacketed extension so we've already put the thermocouple into the heater plate again make sure that's nice and tight and has a little bit of thermal grease to help it securely in now at this point we are just going going to connect the power out these three terminals to their corresponding connector now like I just said the polarity here doesn't necessarily matter because we've connected one of each heater together and one of each heater together here so whichever one we decide is hot or neutral that's going to be it it doesn't necessarily matter but the obvious one here is green to green ground so this is what makes the connection so we have both plates grounded which will also ground your press and anything else touching to it we have that grounded and then the last thing we're gonna do is take will designate this one the neutral here this group will be the neutral so we will connect it to the last remaining open way go make sure that's nice and secure and then our hot make sure she's twisted up nice and into the last remaining way go so three-way goes three wires in our jacketed extension power out so the last thing we're gonna do is we just have to put the flange on here this is the floor flange that we built already we've put our m5 set screws right through the side bore holes here so m5 set screw right there through the side and then we've already tapped the top of the plates to the corresponding holes right there easy as it gets this is kind of the last step formality if you guys didn't realize this needed to happen this needs to happen and wha-la that is securely on now let's go mount it to a press so I can show you how it works actually let me get this stubby out of here get this ready to show you guys mount it up plug it in is we just have to put the flange on here this is the floor flange that we built already we've put our m5 set screws right through the side bore holes here so m5 set screw right there through the side and then we've already tapped the top of the plates to the corresponding holes right there easy as it gets this is kind of the last step formality if you guys didn't realize this need to happen this needs to happen and voila that is securely on now let's go mount it to a press so I can show you how it works actually let me get this stubby out of here get this ready to show you guys mount it up plug it in and just verify she's working it will work through anything here we have the plate system sitting here ready to go we have not plugged it in yet because before we do I want to go back into the box you have the box we have our power coming in going to where it needs to go signals everything's there you can secure it the relay down with a little bit of thermal epoxy or you can use some very short screws or you know dremel or grind off the back of the screws if they do go through the project box but just secure it down so it doesn't move around and the one key thing we need to do in here is I want to put some electrical tape over these contacts you have these exposed down here these are what we go on to cover so we're gonna take a strip of electrical tape and we're gonna go right over both of these just to insulate them electrically so that way anything rattling around in here won't have any issues so now you can see just got some electrical tape over the connectors here are the terminals here and here for both the AC and the DC the AC is your main concern there you don't want this thermocouple sheathing touching that in any way but the DC side you also don't word out over there and there so we have everything completed ready to go ready to plug it in let's mount it to the press and then we'll plug it in let it start heating up double-check our temperatures make sure things are good so as you can see it's sitting here this is pretty much everything the press comes with I mentioned before anything from 6 to 12 tons will do you're right for this build the more you want to spend on your press to get things like pressure gauges other things like that that's up to you pneumatic doesn't matter but anywhere from 6 to 12 tons with this size plate will get the job done bigger plates more pressure or towards the upper end of this range smaller plates less pressure towards the lower end of this range now the mounting system here it's basically most presses come with these these steel blocks these are great but the one issue we have with any press and any heated plate system is these get hot and we don't want the press to get hot so we need to insulate the plate somehow now there's two points of contact from the plates to the press and that's the bottom plate and it's the top plate to the RAM the bottom plate gets the most contact it pretty much will sit on whatever you put it so what I use here it's just wood most of the time I'm pressing or using this heated plate system under 200 degrees at most 220 and I haven't gone that hot in a long time so a piece of wood here I have a just a little I don't know what this was at the time maybe maybe a little more than 1/4 3/8 piece of plywood or so and it's obviously gotten a little darker and you know be careful we use some kind of insulating material based on your pressing temperatures so I'm kind of silicone pad many of things anyway the bottom plates like I said the biggest contact points also the easiest to insulate the top plate is a little interesting and I don't actually have an insulated now I have too much issue with it but ideally if there was a little silicone pad or something we could slide down right into this into here where the Rams gonna sit that would be our our ultimate line of insulation but as long as you get the bottom and you you press your material quick don't leave all day turn it off you know you should be good to go so no further ado let's get this get this press mounted that all we need to do is when you need to align the plates where they need to go then we're gonna bring the press system down so now we have the press system down the RAM the plates everything's touching the steak yeah I can't move the plates so you don't need to kill pressure you don't need to squeeze it like you're pressing the biggest thing in the world you just want the plates flush and to know where they're flat and at that point we can start tightening the set screws and now I use a hex hex or allen wrench screws for these just because you know when you're torquing something against anything a little more secure but if you if you just happen to use your Phillips or whatever it doesn't doesn't particularly matter but we're just pinching the RAM that's all we're doing we're just pinching the ram and the fact that it's already pressed press down in there so nicely it's nice and sick here now watch we're gonna release pressure and the plate will come right up damn so perfecto I guess it's time to see if all our wiring was correct and plugged this baby in look at that fires right up apparently it's 80 degrees in here already so what you have here on your PID display is you have in green underneath that's your target temperature all you need to do is use the up arrows and down arrows to get to the desired temperature and then press set and at that point any time you unplug or replug in your machine or turn it on or off it'll go back to that setting now you don't need one of the biggest questions I get asked is do I need to program it what settings do I use if you get the ink bird the 106 that I showed you it comes preset and most ink bird pids do and you don't need to mess with any of the settings if you want to get really complicated with your with your overshoot and undershoot you're one of those professionals you probably don't even need me for this video if you if you really need to tweak with your settings the standard PID settings are really really accurate work very very well so the last thing I wanna do is when we're not using the system or when it's heating up I want to to have the plates resting against each other that way the thermocouple well how it works is this plate will interact and these will reach an equilibrium and that'll give the thermocouple the most accurate representation of what's going on because again we're only using 1 PID here see the plates are heating up very very quickly that's that's the whole idea of this double heater per plate system we have almost instantaneous heat up it has been less than 2 minutes and we're already at 160 360 for climbing very very fastly so with a system that heats up this quickly we're gonna want to give it just a little bit of time once it does reach temperature to kind of find some equilibrium get to that true temperature but nonetheless look at this baby go flying plates been sitting here heating up doing their thing really just staying at temperature for the last 15 minutes or so so giving them time to kind of hit an equally equally briam there and you can see I have it at 180 point 5 degrees here for my desired temperature and it is like bouncing right up and on that perfectly for the what the thermocouple of the PID is saying and I can tell you by my hands it's pretty it's pretty hot but to be even more accurate I have a secondary thermocouple hooked up here and this is hooked up in the back right basically where a ground would go and one of those holes I had to I'd kind of accidentally put an extra hole in there so we have the thermocouple back in there and this is an unjacketed thermocouple so it's just raw through my couple inside a hole and it's reading a hundred and eighty-five hundred and eighty-six with just under there and so that's basically it's about a five or six degree difference between what I'm seeing here to what's actually going on and that's pretty good you know we're not going to be perfect and like I said maybe there's an air pocket if we could get our taps or our threads down farther we could get that thermocouple to pinch up the metal itself I just didn't quite have the correct tap to do it I guess but nonetheless fairly accurate here we can totally work with this so for me I know I have about a five to six degree difference so if I want to press at 195 I'll press I'll set my temperature to 190 but that's about that's really it we have we have nothing left to do then retire this and what you're looking at here is a completely functional PID controlled heated plate system so whatever you want to use it for go ahead and do that but thank you guys for falling along like I said I know this was one of the most requested videos to be made or re-uploaded or every so I hope this answers all your questions get you guys back on track for your builds for your references whatever you need this for that's what it's here for so thank you guys for supporting me following the channel if you're not following the channel go ahead and give it a fall give this video life really appreciate it helps it on it helps it along we've we've come back a long way since getting deleted originally but we will continue to produce fantastic safe videos over and over and over again so thank you guys peace [Music] [Music]", "0Z1r5pOzH7Q": "what's up everybody welcome back to the channel this is captain Riggs bringing you guys an update here on the flower room week two well first of all happy new years to everyone hope you guys had a good and safe New Year's Eve New Year's Day and here we are in 2020 you guys me personally I have of course the cliche goals of you know stop procrastinating and make things more of a priority and prioritize my to-do list on a day to day basis that's about where I'm at with my New Year's resolution so anyways guys it's been about two weeks since we had made a last video and so I wanted to bring you guys a quick update on where we are at we are at the tail end of the stretching phase as you can see and I'm really pissed to admit this obviously but I think I'm gonna be dealing with like bleaching again you know I I thought that considering that the plants were not in seven gallons but you know they're in five gallons now and I threw them into flour earlier than I did the previous time which was right at nine weeks they have stretched this far you guys you know I'm 5 foot 11 and these plants are pretty much as tall as I am so this is obviously an issue they've been stretching way more than I anticipated I'd like to contribute some of this to some of the nutrients that I've changed up hopefully at least that's what I want to thank just because of the fact that you know I've been adding a lot more beneficial bacteria than I ever have in the past and so I did that because obviously I wanted to promote further growth and here we are at a point where man I don't even know what to do with this [ __ ] what I'm gonna do is I'm going to go through this and I'm going to show you guys what the next step in my little regime here is where I should say regiment and what I do guys after I reach about two weeks is I like to go through and defoliate I know this is a controversial topic for a lot of folks and you know there's some people that will tell you not to do it and there's good reasons why you shouldn't and then there's some that will tell you that it's not a bad idea and I am part of the group that likes to go ahead and you know take off the fan leaves just because we want to expose as much light down here as possible as you can see I have the spectrum set so that we can obviously kind of appreciate the health of the plants which they're all just doing absolutely phenomenal no no deformities no discoloration no deficiencies at the end of the day they are just doing phenomenal nothing is yellowing out things are looking great so what I want to do is go through and pretty much I like to be a little bit more on the extreme end you guys I pretty much take every single fan leaf off and I'm gonna do that so I wanted to show you what things look like beforehand and then once I do go ahead and take off all the fan leaves then I'm going to go ahead and lay my next trellis net over in hindsight obviously I messed up and I should have already had the netting so that they grow into it but I did not expect things to be as tall as they are obviously I mean this is ridiculous just to bring you guys up to speed here we're looking at 16 plants this is the wedding cake strain week to zero co2 in a closed room and we are using kind LED XL 1000s and we have three of them so I'm for sure going to be dealing with some light bleaching again what I'm gonna do is once I do foliate tomorrow I'm gonna put the next layer of netting down and I'm gonna try to take away as much height as I can by you know bending these in certain ways and try to manage this as best as I can you know I had stopped growing for about seven eight months so you know it does does take a second to kind of remember some of these little things that really really do matter the next batch I'm going to throw in much earlier in the flower so that we can hopefully avoid this issue but overall guys I mean things are looking nice at the end of day I can't deny the quality that's for sure things are looking really nice week two of flower so I'm gonna go ahead I'm going to be fully in as much as I can I'm going to then take another video show you guys where I'm at and just kind of show you how how I liked it once it one thing I'm also gonna do is I'm gonna go through and I'm going to get rid of a lot of the slower [ __ ] you know if you look at the net and that's at two feet so I'd already done what I thought would be enough but obviously you know not nearly as much as it should be but hey you live and learn I'm the next one that's gonna be better anyways guys hope you guys are all doing well happy new years to you all and I'll see you guys soon peace", "pcgb1YtOGd0": "[Music] [Music]

squashing of this beautiful Keith on rosin tech big smash we'll see how it turns out love rosin tech because they pretty much have a press for any kind of use that you need from high-end industrial but a lot of weight a lot of frosting to even a small little go press 750 pounds that you can use and travel with plus if you use the code uncle stoner and all caps on rosin techcom you'll get a 10% discount on anything you purchase from them alright so let's get squashing so this is 12 grams of Keith we're gonna be pressing low and slow we got it on 145 here for the first thing is you want to let just touch the material once it hits the material you want to stop and let it sit there for anywhere from 10 to 20 seconds you know letting it all first press of the 12 grams we just did we're about the we press it again cuz there's a lot left you can just see all the [Music] for the second spots we turn the heat up a little bit more just alright we repress this for three minutes just repress up 12 grams of Keith let's see what we got oh you did get a little blow out there down but we gather this around right here all that still got that and then that we just take away his uncle

wash it you did about somewhat the same kind of maybe a little less but the quality fell off but it was still worth it to wash I'm pretty sure you probably could have went a third time and probably got some something off though too but nothing that was really worth it to me but this is really some decent quality for a second wash pretty happy with the results all ball we should would do it a little bit more but the quality is totally there especially off this first wash which was uh it's gonna be well worth it yeah it was a six minute wash being the but this is the wedding cake it is what is it wedding cake is cookies and cherry pie for sure you know cookies in shape are so you know it's the second wash now we just gotta let it dry so we can press it up and turn it into rosin or

which is like two two months ago from the day I'm recording this so not too old they have a size four that there's really just and what I mean so let's it's sealed by like a little sticker right there so I dropped it so let's go ahead and like take that stick with I'll crack the steel and open this [ __ ] up so yes oh I didn't open this thing up so so so we got it open Ned pretty self-explanatory pretty simple packaging I mean it's [ __ ] dope it gets the job done like it definitely gets the job done and it looks [ __ ] dope with it I mean just not really much to say about it like it is what it is you know what I mean so yeah um inside that though he's in parchment paper and your shadow right there so go ahead and open this up oh yeah just looking fire I'll get some close-up shots for you guys in a second here you guys go it right off the bat that's just looking [ __ ] fire so let me get some close-up shots at my phone real quick for you guys and then tell me down below in the comments where you guys think of it like looks-wise on then we'll get the [ __ ] spoke initiate you know what I mean so yeah just give me one second and then we'll get into this [Music] I got like 30 seconds recorded on my phone so I got some close-up shots for you guys but oh but yeah I want to start smoking on this channel I'm trying to get high right there for a second but not for oh I'm trying to focus on this so the TAC you're in though I'll give that sugar rating already I mean like it could it's [ __ ] dope for like for what it is you don't mean like a lot of companies issues like rebel envelopes and like they finally just white and boring you know I mean I always say if they went out of their way like to like put that like whole 3d and not 3d effects but like um what do you call that shiny effect on it and make it look oh I like make their own car inside its cardboard - it's not like plastic paper so yeah it's cardboard it's not paper - that's a plus but besides for that like it's nothing really too fancy there's definitely like wait [ __ ] more cool like I mean like the packaging is whatever I mean like you're gonna throw it away anyways it doesn't really [ __ ] matter but there's some companies that like that go out of the way and it makes it go faster packaging you know what I mean so it's just even though it doesn't really matter it's just kind of cool sometimes but on a scale of one to five I'll give that like a three out of five maybe a 3.5 out of 5 just because like like I said it's dope as [ __ ] for what it is like it's just a [ __ ] envelope or like for being just like a generic envelope it's not like them just a plain white one that they did their own thing I mean so look at that like half a point for being like creative and unique but they can get something more unique you know what I mean but besides for that it the next thing the looks of it looks of the shatter on a scale of 1 to 5 this shit's looking [ __ ] fire it's looking I can see like a lot of that you can see the Terps in it's looking like a little saucy ass definitely looking [ __ ] fire I don't know tumble down below in the comments what you guys think of it good you guys already [ __ ] seeing it but here's another look at it definitely looking [ __ ] fire now I constantly pick up this leg trip I pick them up all the time this isn't my first time trying them because I've worked in love their products probably they're an arizona-based brand but if I'm wrong and down below in the comments but I already know the kids are gonna be [ __ ] high quality all the time and especially for the price point so I believe their grams like normally like $40 45 50 and they chorus and like better like THCA like tops up shelf [ __ ] that goes for like more like 60 80 but like this stuff was up 40 dollars a gram yeah that's just 40 bucks a gram so but 40 [ __ ] dollars a gram that [ __ ] is [ __ ] fired and they're constantly like I would say like at least once a week or once every other week they have a buy one get one free deal so you can pretty much get it for like 20 bucks a gram you can't [ __ ] beat that right there like that's not [ __ ] steel you know what I mean fire uh so the price point I mean not the price point oh I guess we could do both with the price point I'll get that [ __ ] like a when they had the buy one get one free deal five out of five laptops but even like forty bucks a gram for this [ __ ] that's still like a five out of five for like a four and a half out of five that's this isn't [ __ ] fire like I mean just off looks and then like the looks of it like just like I'm having I mean I've smoked their [ __ ] product like their products before but in this video I haven't smoked any of this yet but it's based off the looks this [ __ ] looks [ __ ] fires it based off the looks I'm gonna give it like a in between a four and A four and a half out of five so like up one two out of five that makes sense you know what I mean oh yeah enough talking I feel like I've been rambling let's get into [ __ ] smoke now so I'm gonna get a little smaller not a small dab but a little a little decent dab you know I mean because we're getting a little taste test first see how this is so look you guys can like show you guys how well it's gonna be kind of hard for me show you but like you obviously see how it's melted on the side it's just like super saucy you can just like screen that up I don't know how well that's the cameras picking that up it's like the sides are like super turkeys like sauce you know I mean our room is cold as [ __ ] so it looks like there's no weight like noted but that's [ __ ] fire um but yeah my good at like a little decent dab nothing crazy big get a little taste test going see what this just isn't like and then other we take this would take a couple of bigger dives and get a little high test going see how I'm feeling you know what I mean so that's not Vince's it's a little bit like um shatter sugar flats like kinda has like a little bit of a sugar texture to do that that makes sense but say here's the dab like I said it's nothing [ __ ] huge nothing too small but it'll get the job done mr. Bellamy smoking that up for the nothing too fancy that's like a generic rigna didn't like name-brand but to recyclers that's where you do a pretty dope right but now so it's good this tastes though it's going to go one the pot like I said yeah [Music] my card caps so I'm just gonna use this um it'll work it'll get the job done just a [ __ ] little empty box containing you know what I mean so yeah where's that that here it is so if you guys are smoking on long cheers I hope you guys have smoked with something dank and let's get this little piece that's going because I want to take some [ __ ] fat dabs and get high so yeah let's go choose super smooth super clean the fire honestly on that first not really much flavor like it was just super clean like super smooth with Jonah man the guy didn't even call I didn't even have the urge to off like some correct wedding cake is like a cross train between like your spell cookies and what is it a trick chirayu pie right if I'm correct it's kind of shut up like a sweet earthy taste to it I guess I've been since I guess that's what I could say I had I got a sweet earthy taste to it cuz it didn't really have much flavor um it just tasted fire like some pure wax you know what I mean like I don't know maybe on this next to I'll taste it a little bit more of it'll go on for a fatter Deb multi-hit alone I don't know my rate is probably gonna change after I take this tab but just based off that first hit the this taste I'll probably give like a four or five yeah that's going for it fatter dad now sir yeah all right so I'm take a pretty fat dab right here so yeah let me take a little snake and that [ __ ] looks far like I don't know like you could just see like a little of the Turks in it like yeah like a head like that sure your wax texture to it I don't know like I don't know if you guys can really see you okay there's some oh my finger take my thumb but I don't know how I can get the camera to focus on a little bit better maybe you guys can see it I don't know it just has like the [ __ ] look I don't know it just has like it like some like a turf texture to it but I don't know if you guys can see no oh yeah that's a dive about the tape pretty [ __ ] fat so I guess this would be like a little high reading if for 40 bucks a gram line it should have [ __ ] fire there whatever seals like dripping in our area definitely pick it up yep and if you have like a buy one get one free deal definitely don't miss out on that which is called the quarter twenty bucks I don't even see how they're like I don't know that makes me wonder like how cheap they're getting it for like they cost them to make it like this sign it for 20 bucks a gram you know there's still probably like making a hella profit off but and it's [ __ ] fire sign above you know what I mean but I don't know it's just [ __ ] weird but threat of smoking along I hope you guys are smoking something thank you you guys are cheers Cheers [Music] [ __ ] bro [Music] so I don't know how well that uh smoke showed up on the camera because I think he brought us lights and a makes it like alright for my camera to pick up the smoke sometimes but I took that dad but like the perfect temperature is so light I mean like you think I got a lot of smoke but for like the size of the dab it wasn't as much smoke as a room only thing but like inches because I [ __ ] took it at like a low temperature you know I mean but like I definitely [ __ ] got all that [ __ ] in my lungs oh my god that [ __ ] [ __ ] hurt I'm not gonna lie and I'm definitely [ __ ] throwing highs [ __ ] out so if you guys can tell but not like I've been saying that [ __ ] is definitely [ __ ] fires [ __ ] I got some more [ __ ] on blue dream crumble rhythm comes in like this little box a little bit [ __ ] different I'm gonna be dropping a review on this [ __ ] soon so if you guys want to see that stay tuned but I'm gonna get the [ __ ] high four point three out of five fire is [ __ ] but this I think some more fire wife's out there but you gotta [ __ ] pay the price but for being 40 bucks it's Stephanie [ __ ] dumb fire you're not I mean um like I don't have any complaints at all in fact uh but um uh yeah overall score I'll give like a four point two out of five I know that's like a weird score but I feel like it deserves more than a four but it's not all the way up for four point five yeah I mean so yeah four point two but yeah if you guys liked this video after the big thumbs up comment like subscribe do what I could show you you know what to do how many if you guys liked them down below in the comments give me video ideas suggestions suggestions anything anything you guys want to tell me you don't blow in the comments that's what the comments

you go 31 grams of dry sit on the Swisher thanks for watching", "iCEdZMUU8b0": "what's going on you guys hope you're having a good day so far it's been a couple weeks since I've made my last video a lot has been going on at the new place I started work again so it's been tough to get in here and make these videos but as you can see the veg tent where the fros were I did take clones off of a lot of them and then I tossed those moms away just to make room for these plants in here right here this is the Kim cookies the GMO right here I kept it going just in case this strain turns out to be a keeper I was on the fence for so long whether to keep it or not but I like the way that it's stacking up in flour so I went ahead and kept the mom going back here is the runts from elevate genetics as you can see man it is blown up it's looking amazing I'm gonna be taking clones off of this to go into flour after the chem cookies in about a week this is just my favorite froze a that I liked I took lumps of it but I'm keeping this one just in case over here my last sunday punch run until I start trying some new genetics so these are getting ready to go into flour they're looking really good growing really nicely and then some new things happening in here is this rack I have turned into my veg table or my clone early veg keep my mom's alive these are the lux clone light LEDs 18 watts apiece they're all Daisy change to get daisy chained together as you can see there's four down here this is where I'm gonna keep my mom's these plants right here they're not looking too good but they just came out of the Dixie Cups today they've been in there for over a month in the Dixie Cups so they're not looking great but I know once they transplant into these once I I know now that they're transplanted into these one gallon pots I know they're going to take off from here and become healthy again so I'm not too worried about it but yeah so on this rail I got four Lux clone lights and then up here I have three this is where early early veg out of the cloner into the rockwool cubes I'm gonna put them in here I have the rack tray from bow Tanic air 2x4 it's gonna be able to fit all 16 to be able to go into flour and then up here I got the froze a is their cloning right now as you can see and then I also got strawberry shortcake across with TK these are from jungle boys and if you follow me on Instagram I post a way more than I do on YouTube so go ahead and give me a follow if you'd like link is going to be in the description below and then I'm harvesting out in the morning under the Gavita 1700 e we got the sunday punch they're looking amazing they're flushing right now just take a look catch that focus I don't know it's not catching it hmm well it's looking just like it did before super frosty nice size buds I know I'm gonna get over a pound and a half in here not sure if it's gonna hit two in my last run under the Gavita it hit just under two so I'm hoping to hit two this time but I'll be happy with the same as last in here the GMO from divine genetics these girls are stacking up so nice in here super easy to grow defoliating opened up the canopy so much things are looking amazing this is under the mango tech the think Gro led model H right here but I'm loving the way these are stacking they're gonna be nice big fat colas nicely spread apart and like before like I said before when I threw him in the flower they had stretched quite a bit wasn't super impressed with it so they are looking super lanky down here but that's alright I did for the first time went and picked up of the full lineup of emerald harvests now I've been using these for quite a while but I usually go and buy the one gallon bottles but I decided to pick up the whole lineup in the 2.5 it's a little bit cheaper super stoked that I was fortunate enough to be able to pick it up in this size but yeah things are looking good I got one other thing to show you guys I picked up a couple weeks ago super excited about I've been using it quite a bit with some low grade hash but let's go take a look in the last thing I wanted to show you guys right here is the low temp rosin press that I just picked up a couple weeks ago super excited about this this is the v2 right here the plates I went with the three inch by 5 inch plates I was torn between the 4 by 7 or the 3 by 5 and I figured for what I'm doing and meeting it for the 3 by 5 is going to be plenty for me and then I went with the BVA compact hand pump this thing is absolutely amazing it makes pressing so easy I did an unboxing video and everything but I realized I had no idea what I was doing so I figured I would just make this video after I have had everything set up and looking good I also got this low temp pre-press and then I went to Harbor Freight and picked up this one ton Arbor press right here to pre-press all of my stuff now I am going to be bolting this down in the back when you put pressure to put pull this down it push brings up the back so I do need to bolt that down I went out and got this husky toolbox specifically for this setup right here and I couldn't be happier with it it looks awesome up here just show you guys a little bit of what it looks like I don't like the strawberry red just to match the the pump and it looks amazing this thing is so heavy getting it out of the box anywhere you're gonna need two people if you have the pump hooked up or it's I think 30 pounds or something like that so picking this up with one hand along with the pump it's pretty tough to do so I when I move it I have to have somebody help me with it but yeah this is uh this is awesome I'm going to be able to press my own stuff now I might do a run specifically to get some fresh frozen and wash it and then dry it out and get some really nice live rosin going VI man this thing looks absolutely amazing looks way better than a lot of those companies out there that you see there presses are just huge it's gonna take up a good spot in your garage but this thing it's it's just compact looks awesome and it can fit pretty much anywhere and just put this thing on the kitchen counter take it to a friend's house super easy won't be that hard and in the husky toolbox you know I got the black label parchment paper right here pretty nice and this toolbox just allows me to store all of my tools and stuff I don't know anything about pressing rosin so these are just a few pieces off of a few runs that I did i dri sifted with the trim bin all of my trim I would freeze my trim just kind of run it over my trim bin for about 10 seconds and collect all of that fresh hash rosin or hash from the trim bin and then press it and then I got a washer for bubble hash did some bubble hash with some material got some really nice-looking stuff right here I know once I get some high-quality material put in I'll be getting better looking stuff out of it the stuff that I put in was like mid grade I would say but can't wait to get this down yeah I guys just got my drawer for all of my tools in here but main reason why I got this toolbox was for the press it just looks so good yeah guys that's it for this video hope you have a good rest of your day and I'll see you soon", "PYQpgpfFLdY": "Oh in the cut welcome everybody today we got some fire ass wedding cake look at that [ __ ] see if it

actually this I'm saying it tastes fight why does it taste like that Rose I'm saying oh it has like a mango cakey type job huh literally taste like something like some Asian rights brought like some steamed rice Terrebonne swear to God I haven't tasted my fair enough I [ __ ] this I like that's just fine huh and when I see it cuz I'll say oh this is CBD I'm pretty sure I know I know what you purchased but I never tried one of the Hollies but it has a lot of team it's 220 2.34 CBD really is like I mean everyone's trying to get into huh 61% wealthy that's a lot that's a lot of on video

[Music] [Music] [Music] oh very oh yeah oh yeah you're good you shiny assault yeah slam bro you as shiny as a wedding cake bro all right also the wedding cake what about the one that you took that one tasted good too I just kind of [ __ ] up cuz I was like we're supposed to keep the smoke in the dungeon only in the dungeon I kind of like shot it out to the public what the [ __ ] only when you're hella close know like whatever you mean Oh [Music] oh-oh-oh [Music]", "5fzwMEZ3g2Y": "[Music] what's a bad simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title this is a live rosin jam I believe and this is a wax that actually had on a previous video I wanted to do a video based on this product alone out of the four grams that we picked up from that one video but yeah this is the only one that I picked up the rest was Randy's but this one stuck out this was $36 a gram and it says live rosin you guys can see it you're gonna be using my trusty utility in five which has been good to me just show you what this look like so it says right off the bat you got the live rosin right there I mean it's big a sticker the brand is 1111 which is I guess the time I know eleven eleven supposed to be in like when it's that time you supposed to make make a wish or some [ __ ] whatever I don't know but you can see right here they consider it a rosin Jam and the strain is orange creamsicle rosin you know I've had a few videos on my channel where I've made some rosin rosin is basically when you squish with heat and pressure with the nuts and then on the sides it seeps out all the oils that are actually in the nug and this one's live rosin lunch I've had live rosin before I'm not sure what they do to make live rosin but if I were to guess it was they probably freeze it's basically the way that they make live resin but instead of making live resin and like running it through BHO they squish it after freezing the the dried material I could be wrong so if any of you guys know please correct me in the comments below let's just open this game so I already smelled this I've really know the smell and everything I've actually tasted it in that video and what this gave off was that salt lemon line like Mexican candy like smell but when you take a hit it definitely tastes like that and much more it's like a fresher I don't know how to describe it but I mean just it's a bit darker than I my rosin would be because I've had 7/10 labs before and you guys know like that's just you know the apex when it comes to Rosen's and all that I mean it's not bad you know but doesn't look like it's worth now it was but then again looks can be deceiving see just how good this is my trusty Dan tool so as usual I'm gonna take a hit blow it into a camera and then we're gonna see by blowing it into the light how much I actually take because I know me hitting a beep in is not like the most prettiest sight I know there's no thing where you can see it fill up which is I pleasing you know but as long as I could blow him to life and prove to you then I'm not taking small eyes just so right at the back consistency it's a very stringy [Music] very stringy but I feel like this is much easier to pack on she's here that's worth it to have we I also got some tea well yeah so I had a rough night yesterday well not a rough night you know I was just like in drinking and smoking till about 5:00 a.m. and I woke up at 11:00 so you can see my hair is all [ __ ] up but disregard that Cheers so you could definitely taste like that lemon salt paste but there's like a orange freshness to that hit and I'm I'm guessing it's because its life rosin and basically most of the Terps that are from the original plant is still in there and it makes it gives us a unique taste I don't know how to describe it but initially based on looks I was kind of upset even though the budtender she did help us and she said that was fire it is fire never like you know it based on looks itself it looked like some [ __ ] brown ass pho but I was definitely wrong and uh yes different good stuff so I'm taking another hit for you guys blow it into the light we're talking a call in a video hopefully you guys have been enjoying the content lately and you know I've been doing like in five four or five videos a week which is a pretty good scheduled for me I don't have to you know stress too much about getting a video on every day it's been like four or five weeks where I've been live-streaming consecutively so be sure to check those out on Tuesday hammer talked about hey Cheers the taste is unreal like it's definitely like then tastes like weed but it you can def it so it's a weird weird taste but I I think I've [ __ ] enjoy it it's not like your typical salt lime taste that I've seen from others like products and stuff and other strains like that Clementine from friendly farms they say exactly like that but this one just adds to something more to it I'm not too sure what it is but it could be just because it's live rosin not too sure if I'm adding million all right hopefully you guys enjoyed the video [Music] [Music]", "PJw7RqZ1uRM": "all right everyone the wedding cake I got an ounce from she 28 29 grams and it's all trimmed like this so it's not bad for a sativa when you expect it to be like all thanks and stuff not much for sativa this pretty dense pretty good the 28 grams I said that I really own the season I was like I hope I can get him ounce off 8.20 I trimmed like all that the leaf off pretty much though so I would have had a little bit more if I left a little bit more leaf on like I prefer my stuff like this so I'm happy with the first I got from that one plant turnouts so it's just curing it up in this jar I like to cure my stuff in the jars most of the time I like to try different ways to know it smells delicious let me know how it is when I start unless when I try that it's gonna cure it for a little bit put a few packets at the bottom

we're gonna get to tour their facility which is something I'm really really hyped on I think the only other hash facility move toward is Bo's down in Southern Oregon always such an awesome thing to see where they produce the hash because it's so different from pho where you have all these big cylinders and you can't really see what's going on no the hash you can just pop your head right on into those rosin presses and see what the [ __ ] being squirted out there I gotta get up I took the coldest shower ever this morning so I'm nice and awake but also very cold which is why I'm still in bed

of clothing for the most part so the men saw two weeks in in the cloners and then you know you get a you get some some beautiful girl girl but two weeks in the cloners and then they get transplanted to the racks and put in four inch square pots in cocoa and then they'll spend another two week on the racks under this just p5 fluorescent lights now this is where we have a lot of our just backup genetics and you know we always keep redundancy on like Oliver you know moms and then we have a lot of a lot of new seedlings together with one Zaffino hunts and [ __ ] now especially out here that

go from the four inch square plots into a five gallon [Applause] this room wanted now a moving table system oh [ __ ] so that's that way we're not losing a lot any you know area for you know the actual aisleways and we're you know able to utilize all the square footage you know in here without wasting any space this is their next step from the room that we were just sent exactly we'll fill up this room they'll probably take us you know by this afternoon then we'll they'll spend another two weeks in here and then and then they'll be ready cuz we've just moved everything out of this room yesterday and filled another room cleaned it this morning and then our transplants you know we're like you know we can harvest the whole 72 light room in a day and then putting it in like few days and then be able to refill it again you know the resets are very this whole place is so clean its pristine pristinely clean so I'll turn on the green light so these just got put in here last night you get a different smell in the air - yeah - more than we do very deep cleaning of these rooms in between we'll wipe down every surface these are PVC walls will flush you know the entire condensate collection system well you know flush and take apart our entire irrigation system bring the tables back down that you know pretty much like they're brand new every place all our oil fires it's country money now we go through a very deep cleaning process you know really make sure that we're I've never seen anything like this this is easily the most efficient and high skill facility I've ever seen [ __ ] insane Wow in the middle that's why we have to create this going on this room there's a lot of Fino honk going on in the center of the room with Sour Diesel be x2 by Pharma welcome zero which is high so what those monsters are does I think that hels belles Wow to be a big boy jeez got cowboy Wow how far in of these these are about 25 days Wow so just start [Music] the flower really plants are you know sometimes doubling in size so that's really when we lay the trellis on you know pretty much right at the beginning and by the time that we breathe we're training them and through the trellis system to you know really try to form a uniform canopy this isn't probably the best example of the uniform canopy but this is more like what we go to fill you know and pretty much on the top and each one of these little squares and have as many jobs as possible you know periods are really uniform you've been holy [ __ ] it smells insane in here people these are huge yeah yeah yeah let me see your hand can I give this one a yellow eye where's that yeah oh yeah feel free that's that's the Cascade grape that's my c4 SSB LG crossed in my Montana shortened salad Apple Mail people who died on that

24 same exact on the way here really thick it goes away let's play around always got to make this stop for some Indian tiger yeah oh god yeah this stuff is this Shh [Music]", "SoVy7emFQOk": "you're smokin man growin and watch it fall down [Music] DGC Scottie real hanging out and doing something very interesting thank you for Jason from dialed in Terps for coming in I am really interested in trying to learn what do they call this they have to make these high-end extracts and now I always thought they made them with BHO and whatnot now Jason comes over and says no you can actually make them using real high-end water hash and pressing that into rosin and then you jar it up is that this jar tech is that what they call this yes jar tech it's um it's fresh frozen material that's then turn into bubble hash exactly like you said and depressed in the rosin and at some point you know you have to decide what you want to do with is our consistency goes right why is it look so different what's it start out so it starts out as rosin right yeah it's really suffered rosin okay we got a picture of that Ross and that [ __ ] is so bright why the hell is that rosin so bright white well you know quality in quality out you know you want to start with the best material possible when you're starting with the fresh products and you've matured a trichome to its full maturity right and still hold a nice color but I've seen things that are yellow I've seen things that are a dark almost like a tan brown and by the way it can be dankus [ __ ] but I seem like the 710 labs they do that real white five-star water hash sure and you're saying five stars kind of this five star material yeah I think 710 would probably be doing more if they're selling it they're gonna be doing a six star but the [ __ ] the difference help a brother out man all right six stars as good as it gets six stars as good as it gets no cars both wash goes all right that's the bright whites they all really light do you holo bright whites a full milk bubble hash okay put it on a bowl there's not gonna be any residue left got it and that's what's gonna burn clean right that's really what they're looking for for a full bubble hash by the way that 6r that's just expensive man I don't even know I bought that a little bit $75 a gram and I had like no second thoughts after I went through it or like 10 15 bucks it's just you want to do a few it is delicious I agree so is that what that way you end up with here or that's what we start with most stuff you're president of rosin would be a five star hash and what the difference is starting material yes the starting material is gonna leave a little bit of residue if you put a five star hash and a puff go peak it's still gonna taste delicious right you're gonna really enjoy it it's just gonna leave a little residue at the bottom of the bowl when you clean it you ever smoked bubble hash and you see that that's gonna be a five star hash or a four star hash and again I'm just trying to understood the difference is the quality of the material going in right so six star hash this is gonna be no residue it's gonna burn totally clean Wow just like you know when you smoke a full mil okay so what does this start out as this is five star what do you what do you call this this is five star material for that okay with I work really hard in house to peruse really nice flowers that I've fries fresh beautiful right beautiful you've been here about ten years right no I think we both heard the calling and yeah left our homes to come and be growers be growers out in public I love it I really enjoyed my 10 years in Colorado it's I'm home now yeah you're relieved oh yeah you're right he's right by the mountains absolutely beautiful beautiful up there I'll come visit you can't visit me I'll come visit you next time man all right all right let's get into these jars guru's got beautiful pictures of the jars over there yeah what what are we starting Wesley this jar tech I totally don't actually get to start material over here it's mousey absolutely yeah we got everybody in the shop hey that's I think it's secure I meant to do an AB you take that live you know fresh frozen bubble hash it goes into a freeze dryer okay so this is definitely freeze dryer right huge how beautiful beautiful that's what happens when my friends come over you all right so I've took 56 grams yesterday or this morning actually I woke up early at 6 a.m. right and press 56 grams of bubble hash okay and that's important you didn't press flour you're pressing 56 grams of bubble hash gotcha and that's how you really get the old dry quality Cessna and the bubble has just been dried in the freeze dryer okay and now what's in a freezer until I pressed it so to help me out I understand why everybody wants a freeze dryer why why that's like the key to super high quality okay a pretty dryer really is gonna preserve all the terpenes all the cannabinoids and it's gonna preserve its freshness and make it absolutely just perfect right so what so and your freeze drying the buds the flowers before you or your freeze drying the hash here freeze rather than bullish she's got imperious drying the bullish beautiful without losing any of terpenes right you're drying it at an extremely cold temperature wow what a trip all right I get it now I get it all right so now we got we pony that was a tad a process something like that this came up rest us this morning and if I were to pressed it and immediately it would have not started waxing up I've got it we came up to the show it's starting to wax up a little which is fine it's just a little bit harder to collect right so we're I'm in here and that's gorgeous it is warm by the way the air conditioning broke they're fixing it up we just fell right yeah we had this in the freezer and I already pulled it apart and the cold temperatures a key to this know right even everything cold right yeah so it started tearing the wax of him that is impressive that's the starting material okay yeah so now what do we do it now that to me I'd be dabbing the [ __ ] out of that as a matter of fact so is that dabble yeah you want to try it yes yeah you know we've got these these are called a puff coke peak is that what this is yeah absolutely yeah awesome you showed up with one and guru showed up with one the beginning in a week and they really do hit beautifully I think so yeah it's my preferred way to smoke I was a double uh double press here Yeah right Yeah right see he already turned it on so oh no what your right hand I'll turn it off because these are cold start tabs always for you now I just changed it to you take this more damaged how you didn't even started up so you're doing alright beautiful I forgot it's the right temperature I like to do it on green I think if you have a high quality product if it should burn really well and hey yeah I'll shout out to Stony scholar who was teaching me about this at the last dvc cup and he was probably the first time I heard about cold start dabs Yeah right great once ready deal alright I'll get mine going to this I haven't tried this yet this is star dog I did a full spectrum start up here ok beautiful star dog is it's JJ from top dog is that right really so yeah alright so back from bubble hashes is gonna be the 45 of you for me 45 of you all the way to the 160 you I don't even know how what say you what do you you have it's the micron size of the bubble bag say use it oh sure I know about that sorry so both bags coming about half that you get half a dozen bubble bags they go anywhere from what about 30 or something like that 30 microns 25 micron yeah 20 yep right usually or 220 or 190 or contaminate bags and then your your 160 bag you have some really nice head to start in and get in there yeah what he means by that so that's ones you keep your ear material and your starting material bubble bags all right hang on excuse me let me date with the puff coke peak oh yes let me turn my own give me some small talk here so we're starting off with this and then what that goes in a jar tell me how we get to these I don't understand the jar we smoke the [ __ ] out by the way this is amazing hang on a second smells good I haven't tried it yet this is my new harvest I do everything in-house and you know in Colorado you're only allowed to do 12 plants so it's really hard to have material all the time yeah absolutely you can put air quotes around your 12 plants your church things very interesting know if I did it right I still got some left oh oh I better q-tip it is this gurus you could double click it if you didn't want oh I guess going yeah that should have done that and sometimes you could get sugar done the double click oh good thanks pretty interesting best tastes pretty pretty delicious [ __ ] great it's pretty much cold Karen right here that's what you have here so yeah so what I have no idea what's going on here so let's go for it we got what I would smoke right there what are we trying to make we're trying to make diamonds and sauce with it we're trying to that's one of the that's one of the consistencies you can make what are they tell me tell me what are their Jesus movie it's almost offensive right so this is grease monkey and I took a little cookie pucker from camerado and mixed it in with the grease monkey from exotic genetics okay kind of spiced up the Terps a little and made it a little Wow yeah it's interesting smell yeah Jesus it is weird man that's an interesting smell so okay so that starts with this yeah it starts with this and you have your option of collecting into a ball right you know you're gonna take all these and collect it into a big ball Drazen that's easy I done that yeah exactly and you're gonna put it in a jar and seal it okay you could have options you could go into an oven at a temperature around 220 degrees okay 45 minutes an hour and we'll go over that later just a simple of them like a toaster oven or some convection oven yeah perfection oven okay I used my oven in my kitchen when I first started here thousands of dollars of equipment so I guess you got a couple G's in the freezer freeze dryer yeah so freeze right in a bubble bags the good bubble bags are getting up there and prints really and I love those bubble bags I spent my last dime I was on vacation found out those existed and spent my last dime on them it's like I got this right all right so we got we get it uh like this now what we put a leg ball it up put it in a jar how the hell is a ball of that gonna make that that doesn't make no sense to me it's like I said oh okay they'll go into the oven right 20 degrees got it or about 45 minutes this jar is gonna melt up and it's gonna foam up and it's gonna start 2d carved in the jar essentially what you're doing is separating your using solvent as a using terpenes as a solvent you're separating THC and the terpenes got it terpenes will go to the top THC will settle the bottom that will go on a heat map and that will sit on a heat man anywhere from 12 hours to 24 hours and so far none of this is specialty equipment I've got a seed heating mat right there I used to sprout seeds and and make clones with yeah that's what you need yeah kitchen the kitchen of an oven and a seed mat is all you really need I mean if you know this is all very high-end product you're working with medical medical instruments as much as possible right if you have a nice clean Breville convection oven that you could get at Best Buy or bad bad thing yeah all right yeah but aside from the freeze dryer which you'll make a lot of friends with that at least no yeah a lot of folks come into the house oh yeah and so how long does something like this have to sit after so you you bake it and it's it's ready or you sit what you're gonna do is you're gonna take that jar and you're going to essentially turn it into a liquid and though though it's gonna foam up and the bottom will turn into a liquid the bubbles will start to rise up the jar kind of like a beer okay when is three-quarters of the way up the jar is all liquid on the bottom and the top are bubbles it'll look like a beard when it was freshly poured exactly right that's when it's ready to pull out of the oven you're gonna take that jar out of the oven and put it on a heat mat like that and it'll sit on that heat mat anywhere if I can set from 12 to 24 hours and it'll the crystals will start to collect and form and that's it and how long so after 24 hours it's good like that that's only a process I would think it would take weeks for yeah I remember making rock candy as a kid that shook took weeks man it could take anywhere from 12 hours to 4 days five days goddess I've ever seen a jar takers been six days and does it matter about the quality if there's not enough terpenes and in the material or it always work I've seen some jars not work absolutely right not every strain does work but for the most part if you have a good quality starting material you do your process right right you're gonna you're gonna have good results did you see this is [ __ ] cool cuz you can do it with a convection oven and just go over to nosies house man he just bought a kid you didn't you just buy your a freeze dryer brother yes loving it I'll be right over absolutely okay so what other consistencies do we have man you know the most popular consistency in my world right now and I think a lot of people are really digging on is a cold here which hold you here come on get us get us up to speed I told you I gotta go to the 7:10 cup the concentration celebration in a month maybe get my [ __ ] together man this is the cold care dude so show that to the camera man that is if they had that in the store I might run out with it I have to I'd have to think I have to conscience man that thing is uh insane how many grams is this first of all so that's one ounce 28 grams okay yeah that's fun that's fun to have in my hand so has it been whipped yet this I'm still caring okay how long is the Cure on something like that so this the first stop is there a cure on that you said one to four days is that what you're calling it cure so what I'm calling on that is the separation okay yeah you're separating the terpenes or the THC and forming crystals is that after the cure this is so Karen so this has been this foot into a ball right and put into a jar right that's it all I've done is take that collected and put it in the showcase I love it how long's that after how long does that cure so this has been in a jar now for two days okay I'm gonna let this sit in a jar for a few more weeks God okay that's what I was thinking I thought there was some stuff he did for a few weeks and that's room for 60 degrees for a few weeks the sweat get terpenes will start to rise to the top they'll get softer where do you keep a room sixty degrees if we're trying to be practical and helped a DGC actually do this so you just take a cold basement like a dresser drawer got it and it's in the 60s clothes or it has to be dialed in 60 degrees I would consider a six a cold Kyra's 60 degree room okay you could also do a room temperature here is just just fine and it goes quicker it works just fine okay no reason to not do a room temperature here I'm still obsessed over it why not brother yeah if I cure something up it'll be just a pocket cure yeah I call it yeah yeah a pocket cure pocket cure that sounds like something I would do and when you're ready when it's when it's secured and you feel you feel it it's good where you like it right it's sweating terpenes it looks delicious sweating to smoke yeah yeah you take care take your tool and you go ahead and whip it like mashed potatoes essentially what's that can you do that what's that look like right we'll do it to this one all right so this one is the same material that this was the second press material so we'll show that material first of all all right that's the second pressing it's [ __ ] impressive normally when I would do the second pressings or at least a second run with my bubble bags it was much it was a lot less quality can you say a lot less quality much lower quality that's limit to say manthe books I didn't mean it's kicking it I've never been known for the best grammar myself you can make great concentrates nobody gives a [ __ ] about your grammar yeah all right so this one thing about this is an ounce that's announcer there's 14 grams okay half an ounce an ounce looks like yeah beautiful I put this in the oven okay yeah so in order to speed this process up you could put it in the oven as well and do cake batters what a lot of people are called so that's when I goes I get that a batter sometimes yeah okay so my batter out of the oven is gonna come out dry like this it's this is unlit so what about this moist you do there's plenty of terpenes in there and it's delicious and you can smell it it just needs to be kind of whipped okay that's not a fast profile yeah you know I'm more of like a no-till guy man so this is kind of I don't know man right I know it's actually the same idea though you know you get everything exposed to a more surface area get it exposed Wow okay that's looking like something to get it at a dispensary yeah then you start smashing it down kind of potatoes that looks good you know misty all looks getting wet and delicious already and you know right look at that so Leo is soft and gooey beautiful show that to guru man yeah come on you really get a nice good mash on that you're welcome to stop by the bakery any time so so what consistencies is coming like I said this is the end this is a second press and I did put it in the oven just to speed up the process of the cold appear for the show oven will loosen terpenes I don't know I think you could bring out some terpenes well it depends on the strain you know some the oven will bring out terpenes on some strains of them will destroy starting really fragile terpenes and some strands as well huh yeah absolutely I like to do a little bit of both I wish that's my tournament entry so I'm just kind of like oh yeah they're like that I can't smell it yeah you know the press of that so you know you so the quality is there it's delicious you want to try it yes yeah you probably don't ask me that any other man let me see that let me see the whole jar I got that cheese man right I'm happy today it's a good day in the bakery nice limit limit let me hold let me know yes Jesus what strain is this what do you think hate the nausea will you put this all back in the fridge it's totally waxed up it's gonna be really hard to click now but yeah the key thing is cold cold is the key yeah it is colder the better you're working at home if you could turn on the air-conditioner or open up some windows if I live at elevation so I keep everything really cool does that make a difference oh yeah damn I try to keep miles at 60 you know like I'll let you handle it yeah you know I just I start making pizzas and I'll be damned you got a really a just [ __ ] for elevation I'm sure making that stuff that's way sensitive man you really got to adjust you're a mile high up makes a [ __ ] huge difference especially with water absorption I so dry yeah it's almost impossible to keep up yeah is there any difference if people are trying to do this in you know up in Portland where it's more humid or anything is there any kind of special precautions they would have to take well Portland's humid yes what I'm wondering is such a different client man yes so the probably was something somebody that actually lives in Portland to ask wouldn't it yeah I mean you want to keep bubble high school most people professionally love make pilaster live and work and walk-in coolers so this is all about a walk-in cooler this would never hit this temperature as a professional matchmaker yeah yeah so this for the show it would have never made it this long and started to wax up already right I would have collected that immediately put it in a jar you put it in the oven for Jam put it in a jar put in a cold room for a cold cure and now what's a jam what's a jam so the jam would be you know the the crackles that's why we call it jhanas okay okay I believe olio cause a jam 710 calls it premium rosin and I believe gotcha you know there's different companies call it different things so help me out with these pro companies it's because they're able to do things like by walk-in freezers I think I forgot must have forgotten to turn mine on I'm still trying to help you with that Scotty I'm still trying to get this thing what am I doing wrong it's gross I see him that's I'm on it yeah so you want to click it once I'll get once all right and then click it twice to get it going and concert vibrates you're ready to go all right I like it I like it it's pretty cool man let's see a couple of these at the at the 710 concentration celebration I'm gonna bring mine yeah I think it'd be a good way to hit them I mean how torches are cool but yeah this is a safe little bit and a little bit yeah couple hundred stoners with torches sounds cool that's then I hit my sword on my place yesterday I heard a lady I was reaching around trying to fold the back up of a piece of paper I'm sure and sure hit my plate my will templates not so low-temp what they're doing that dude I use a toaster for like five minutes a week and I burnt myself man all right so did you get yours yet uh not yeah I don't think it's ever vibrate uh I mean I was actually making small talks ah there we go man there we go that just turned off double-click that again it it sways boom boom there you go now good now you're I like this thing but what stop at the learning curve how come I'm the only wall to learning curve it's bold school job school study all these gadgets I took me a while to I got laughed at for not having a filter on my joint last week the filter gets in the way honestly kind of taste taste bad throws in anyway hey okay it's a double quick hit that's what it is all right cool man I think we actually did pretty good man I think we uh I think I learned some [ __ ] man you run out I want to see this guy definitely but I'm pretty stoked that you if you invest in a freeze dryer that's kind of you're good to go you can all sudden start making super high-quality extracts like this as long as you're growing super high quality weed y'all I think so I think the learning curve here would be a lot a lot less than making butane hash co2 hash any of those types of hash it's illegal as a [ __ ] is illegal but you know there's a lot to learn yeah there's a legal and then there's a legal yeah yeah you know in a legal lab it's a lot to learn isn't very what's your brand called again I know you got a hangout dialed in Terps man died on turbulent turkey diving terpenes and ER yeah this is some pretty cool [ __ ] you got Instagram yeah I'm an Instagram that's about interest on Instagram other than terpenes on Instagram all right we gotta hang out a little more man this is [ __ ] cool I learned to hold this is like opening up a new world to me I had no idea actually I didn't know this existed because I would see the six star hashes and all these all these crazy concoctions at the dispensary but I really didn't know what went into him or how they were made I love the fact that there's there's no external solvents into it this is just what the terpenes act as a solvent right yeah absolutely it's cool it's awesome so that's yeah you know making bubble hash water solvent carrying agent you using water and ice to break off the trichomes just the very heads of the little live flower and it's bad acid into this yeah it's badass I still think I'm doing this wrong but Jason thanks so much for hanging out man thanks for making the trek and extra show me how to use this thing well though it doesn't even seem like I put the carbon cap on at this point that in terms out intervenes over on Instagram [ __ ] with a match take it easy brother Thanks crack take it easy oh yeah [Music] little break [Music] [Music] yeah [Music] medicine [Music] [Music] today [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "MV5KpSF-4cU": "all right everybody what is good and welcome back to the channel today we're going to be bringing you guys a review on some concentrate or wax or oil however you call it or whatever you call it where you're from and as you can tell by the title on the thumbnail it's going to be on the brand olio and this strain that i picked up is going to be some as you can see here la cush number 50 second press rosin and it's testing at about 79.9 percent full gram here well a little less than because as i always tell you guys it's kind of hard to keep my hands off this stuff and not test or try any of it so when you buy these waxes and you get them they normally normally nine times out of ten are going to come with which is pretty cool they're branded olio [ __ ] dabbers it was kind of blank in there trying to think of what these were called uh it's gonna have their ig handle as you can see here dabo leo 710 and their um website domain dabolio.com and not always as i said will they be they're like branded ones because i've had some where when you open the cases they're different dabbers they're not they're like it doesn't say olio on it like their brand it just is a regular silver little dabber but nonetheless a nice touch that they you know include that and give it to you in the box when you buy it but i mean i guess for the price which recreationally these i think go for anywhere from like 60 to about 80 pre-tax depending as i always tell you guys where you go on the day what day of the week and where because they always have deals but recreationally obviously anything and everything out there is always going to be more cheaper than i mean medically things are going to be cheaper than recreational prices and recreational prices are always going to be more than the med prices so it's just how it is but for quality [ __ ] like this i definitely recommend if you're ever able to get your hands on some oleo to go ahead and pick some up do not hesitate this stuff is amazing opening it up you're gonna get a whiff of like it just smells so gassy so so fire so good and i'm trying to get a focus here see if i could get to zoom in on that check that out look at that glimmer that nice shine that glisten it's beautiful and i wish you guys could smell this this this stuff smells nice gassy pungent sweet has a nice aroma to it and as you can see obviously like i said it's a little underground i couldn't help myself and i had to go ahead and try some out and this stuff tastes really really good as well uh i got some flour right now chop a can of cookies and this [ __ ] is tasting just like that so again if you ever come across some of this stuff and you're ever ever able to acquire any definitely pick some up do not snooze or sleep on any of it but yeah so we're gonna go ahead and uh whip us up a little dab on the dabber here and get to go ahead and try and hit the puffco okay you guys had to crack open the window because it has been super nice lately and it is getting a little warm in here and it's about to get warmer after we take this dab so getting ready to scoop some of this la kush number 50. and trust me like i'm a pretty experienced dabber and like my tolerance is up there so i've like got it to where i definitely need a little decent amount to where like normally like if i were to take something like this let's see if i can get it to focus if i was to take a dab like this you know what i mean if you guys can kind of see that it's not it doesn't really look like much but if i take it out like this with some regular like extracts or some regular like shatter or live resin it would be not enough for me but honestly this of the la push this this the second press rosin this stuff is that's just enough so go ahead and set up our uh set up the puffco get it going there and honestly thinking already about making the move since they came out with this uh since they've came out with the puff gopro definitely trying to make that move and go ahead and get into the i had to turn it off because i had it on the wrong temp i had it on uh red and i usually have it on the peak setting which is the white but i'm definitely considering uh picking up the puffco pro i've only had this sadly for like a couple months and just as i i got this one it was 400 full price and then i paid my last like i paid it with the payment plan that they have on their website you can check out with and just as i paid my last payment they discounted at 300 bucks it's crazy every time this and i got some 710 labs next some sour sour tangy and 710 chem i think it's called and these two 710 labs and oleo some of the two best extract makers in the game so if you're ever able to get your hands on any of like 710 oil or some olio i definitely recommend picking this up the taste is kind of like like perfect it's not too crazy but you gotta you get a little hint of like of like some like honestly i don't even know how to explain it uh words just there's no words to describe how this stuff tastes i mean if you've had some olio before and you can kind of put it into words go ahead and comment down below and let them know but other than that then you kind of do understand at the same time where i'm coming from where this this this stuff just tastes definitely different from like other like live rosins and like you know a bunch of other bs crc added bs but i always gotta i was gonna wipe them down it's got a little boozy these puff coats try to keep them clean and maintained but again like i said it's gonna be another quick short review straight to the point um oleobrand i give it a 10 out of ten definitely recommend if you're ever in the area in colorado to go ahead and pick some up oh that might be upside down a lake cush number 50. it's pretty fire taste 10 out of 10 quality 10 out of look smell it's all good so again leave a thumbs up if you enjoyed the video comment down below on anything you guys want to see reviewed specifically if you guys have any requests any kind of brands or you know like edibles or something that you know you have in mind that you want to see so drop that down below and uh let me know and stay updated and stay tuned peace", "9y0t4deLOHI": "you guys see that solving this live

cause i was leaning for a while but like that she had me feeling good thank you guys for watching [Music] peace out", "WE4H-gXnGJA": "yo what up boy bacon babe today I just wanted to do not really a Q&A but kind of respond to some of the questions that I've been getting in the comment section some of the comments as well we're not necessarily questions they're trying to tell me different ways to do things so I'm not opposed to taking advice only a fool would be but I am opposed to taking advice from people who are just talking but don't do if you don't actively press rosin don't tell me [ __ ] about how to do it because you don't know how to [ __ ] do it yourself I actually do it one of the comments that I had was that on one of my videos where I left a pre pressed puck inside the plates for too long while I was trying to prepare the camera so he did the material up a lot and when it came out it was a little bit darker than normal so a lot of people like to comment on that one and a lot of people are you know one person told me use less less pressure because you get more plant material in your end product and just let the heat lose it all out well that time [Music] Oh [Music] whoa whoa all right I'm still not over being sick completely sober all right so that's what I was saying um that's Bob that's backwards straight-up backwards you want more pressure less key you're not going to get more plant material in your product by using more pressure that's just not how it works the rosin bags that I use are 160 micron there from rosin evolution and they work perfect with my pre-press but you guys have to remember that when you're pressing out rosin the filtration bag excuse me those bags are not for filtration actually they're guesswork [ __ ] look they're just for containment so when you have that puck of flour and you go to press it it wants to expand and as it expands it will reach outside of those pressing plates and then you're not pressing that material anymore right so what the bags do is they don't filter to keep the plant material inside they just they keep it so that the plant material doesn't expand too far out because you could press nugs without any bags and still get all the oil without even collecting plant material the plant material only stays right along the very edge of the Google oil so again those bags aren't for filtering anything they're just for containment and make it a little bit easier what else pressing temperatures so temperatures - depending on your material you're gonna start as low as 180 and go anywhere up to like - 30 to 40 the fresher the material is the less heat that you need to use also the less time you need to press it if material is not the right humidity you're gonna have to press it for longer and you're not gonna get as good of a yield usually 60 to 70 percent relative humidity for your but it's good to start with and I'll usually press it fresh material like starting around 185 190 and if I'm not getting the yield I want but I'm getting the quality then I'll increase the the temperature by about 10 degrees until I start seeing the yield that I want now when you increase the temperature got to remember it's like a it's like a sliding scale right and right where they cross those two lines cross that's the perfect like settings right temperature time pressure so what you're trying to do is you're trying to get to keep high enough to make all of the oil lose out without degrading the actual material right so it's heat that degrades it not pressure so ideally you want as much pressure as possible without blowing out your bags right or breaking your parchment with as little heat as possible necessary to facilitate the flow of oil out of the material usually that ends up being around a thousand psi on your plates so for example my plates are 22 square inches right now to hit a thousand psi you know you're gonna have to get up there around like 13 14 tonnes because you take the max pressure that you're putting out so let's say you're putting out 10 tons that's 20,000 about 20,000 pounds of pressure now you divide that by the surface area of your plates which for me is 22 right and so I end up needing to be somewhere around like what is it I think like 15,000 psi or 15 tonnes will give me about a thousand psi so do the math on your own the base of yes the max pressure you want to get to and then you just change your temperature based on that so the higher the temperature the faster your product will start to flow right now this is where it starts getting tricky and it's a sliding scales because your temperatures too high you degrade your product but if it's too low then it has to sit in there and between those heated plates were too long even though it's a lower temperature it has to sit in there too long in order to start flowing and get the final yield so now you end up with the degrading product so like I said it's a sliding scale you want to have a high enough temperature so that you don't have to press too long but you don't want to have it too high to where it's degrading the product and then your pressure you're just going to keep ramping up the pressure until you don't get any more yield out of it so that ends up being like like I said fresh material 180 to 190 and about two and a half to three minutes for fresh stuff and then for older stuff it's usually I go a little bit higher and press rike around 210 or so for about three or four minutes but it also depends on the type of rosin that you want so a lot of people would see this and be like oh man that looks like like a big bunch of doodoo but this is your super Turkey stuff that's been pressed out at about 180 185 so you're gonna get more of the oily sheen on there right you're gonna get a lot of Terps and it comes out more like a sauce and this is cured this has been cured for about two weeks now and so this is just super super stable and this is really [ __ ] bomb but a lot of people don't like material that looks like this and keep in mind this would be super golden if I were to thin this out but a lot of people want like ghost rosin which is the stuff that is so clear you can almost see through it but people are into the purple rosin now there's a lot of trends but you can't let the color dictate everything because it's not just about the color right because of this stuff fresh bud pressed out at 180 there's a little bit darker and more Turkey than stuff that I've pressed out at higher temps of the same bud I pressed out at 2:30 you know and I've gotten slightly different looking material it was more shatter consistency way lighter color even though it was a way higher temperature right almost 40 degrees higher same pressed time actually was a little bit shorter with the higher temperature because it started to flow faster so I didn't have to press it as long you know this is some more 190 190 180 but you know you can get all different types of colors and consistencies and the point is that it doesn't necessarily dictate the quality it just dictates the parameters that were used when they pressed it so let's see what else you guys want to know cover filter bags temperature pressure time collection don't collect on anything too cold I made the mistake of collecting on top of some dry ice there was a protective surface in between but still the cold got the the rosin too condensate and create some moisture on top of the rosin and that's just because it got too cold so now I added moisture where I don't want to I want to remove it so that's a conditional time to cure and get that out properly but make sure that you have I would say like a couple is regular ice packs and then put it like a cookie sheet and I still look on mat on top of that and that should be enough to keep it just cool enough to collect easily but not getting moisture on it Oh a lot of people asked me about the the paper I use PTFE squares so I don't use parchment the reason I don't use parchment is because 90% of the markets parchment paper is covered in silicone silicon is very very easily broken down by a lot of different terpenes specifically D limonene which is very high and a lot of Turkey buds and so when you go to press you'll notice you have your little circle your puck of Bud and then around that puck there's like little box where it looked like it seeped through the paper or the bud is eating through the paper and that's actually the the terpenes eating through the silicon and then getting through the parchment paper so what happens when that happens is the silicon gets broken down by those terpenes and then when you're scraping up your rosin you're actually scraping up bits of broken down silica that get into your rosin and then when you when you ignite that or vape it burn it whatever that's toxic silica is extremely toxic when ignited and ingestion so those of you that are pressing on silicon treated parchment paper still chances are they're silica in your material you may not notice it but it's there now it seems a little bit easier to collect material off of parchment compared to PTFE if you do not have the correct temperature to collect it on if I were to place ice packs underneath this and then collect my material it comes up extremely easy way easier than parchment nothing gets stuck to this it's the most nonstick one of the most nonstick surfaces known and unlike parchment paper that is only heat treated or heat rated up to like 400 450 degrees PTFE is heat rated up to 500 degrees and pressure rated up to 500 pounds I think it is which is pretty significant nothing breaks through this in my experience I have not broken through a single PTFE sheet so that's why I use these I got a pack of one thousand four by four squares for 125 bucks from turkey roof comm or you can check out the version PTFE roll if you guys are doing bulk compressing with larger presses get a whole roll of this this is 14 inches across and I think this sheet was like maybe safety ET or something like that and this was like I think 100 something bucks it's worth it so think that covers and yeah it's depressing show me what you guys got if you guys have any questions comments please drop them below this was a very impromptu video I was gonna do like a whole little script and make sure I covered each bullet point but dabs happened and then I just started talking and here we are now so that said you guys have any questions about processing material growing anything like that drop them below I reply to almost every single comment if it's worthy of a reply show me what you guys would like to see in the next video and if you guys have any material that you want processed and you know the Southern California area hit me up and I'll press your stuff for you and I'll show you what it's like happy dabbing I'm about to hit this and I'm gonna be out of here [Music] [Music] we're hearing all the stuff in my email probably today because I'm impulsive and I have money right now all I need is another control box similar to the one that I built for my rosin press a PID controller and a plug-in spot for the coil that I already have so it shouldn't cost me a more than about a hundred bucks and I'll be able to build the control box for for the email and I won't be torturing anymore because [ __ ] this shit's annoying especially because I smoke in the grow room now because my wife is pregnant and I'm not trying to have her getting all secondhand smokey up in this [ __ ] so I don't smoke in the living room anymore which is where I usually chill and play video games so I got a run in here to take dabs or smoke and then run back out there in between rounds or games it's like man I wish the [ __ ] was just always lit always torched up ready to go I could just come in here drop it down and be out but I got to spend like a good minute and a half [ __ ] torching this [ __ ] up to get it clean and then let me cool off but it's all good oh yeah the I don't have any packs in here with me but I did make these little gel packs I rosin in coconut oil this shake is for I take four of those it's a wrap a rat I was in Chicago for business with my lady over this past week and that was what I would do I didn't take any flour and dab anything to smoke at all all I took was those pills I was a pill-popping animal and she would hate me like 3045 minutes after I take them and it was just kale like chili Hey [ __ ] dog barking for no reason Cheers [Music] I can't wait to

like area here i'm gonna try to get this like really cool [ __ ] zoomed in shot of the ball we're gonna see if we make it work and see if this [ __ ] actually bubbles up i'm sure you're wondering if it does i'm wondering if it doesn't find the [ __ ] out together all right so as far as the product goes this i got some truly might especially down in bristol connecticut best [ __ ] dispensaries taking these guys awesome you gotta check them out [Applause] this is from ct farming this [ __ ] was a very limited run dave was telling me how he ordered a couple hundred units of this [ __ ] and they still gave him like 40 45 [ __ ] 40 40 foot out of me so obviously it was a very small run i don't even know if it's still on the um menu but i did grab a gram of it i had like two grams of curved originally and i'm like you know what let me not spend a lot of money so it is it's the lunavid cbh blash lunavin is their star killer across the death star it's fire fire strain almost indica and uh there it is i also realized i don't have a dabber with me either so i hope i can [ __ ] use my fingers on this [ __ ] i'm going to have to grab like a zip tie or some [ __ ] over there for my [

marijuana reviews coming at you with the review for the subra melt from fluent subra is there strain of Sour Diesel it is super delicious it almost had like a lemony sour taste towards the end of it this last week about having it and I say that because it's changed but this was it in the beginning it had a very grainy sandy texture not many of the glands had come to like a clear coat covering you know where they've connected and become one okay but then later on after having it out for so long and having smoked it the thing the melt has is oxidized I believe is what the man told me would have happened and that's where the glands have come together it's changing in its flavor it's changed in consistency a little bit it's always actually been pasty and tough to work with you definitely want a sharper tool to use this stuff I had to definitely go out and pick something else up because my little pinpoint dab tools were not going to give me what I wanted to medicate with this is a super delicious product but for a hundred dollars I cannot guarantee you that you're going to feel more medicated from this or better medicated from this than other things such as flour or cheaper concentrates that other dispensaries have it's delicious it's great I mean I've thoroughly enjoyed it but again at a hundred dollars a gram that is for the connoisseur I do not want to say that every first time that we should go out and get this stuff because it's better and because you're paying the higher price it's going to medicate you better it's not now this is a good looking to show you how the consistency of this product really is it is a hard magic sand paste consistency and you almost need that sharp edge to almost cut this pasty dab off it's super delicious but it is going to leave a lot more residue in your dab products and on your tools and in your bowls just FYI so with this product what I'm suggesting is you definitely need to keep alcohol at hand isopropyl alcohol 91% or above so you can keep your dab tools clean so you're not bringing this ashy gunk back into your gram and keeping that up here see how much it can create I did that at a high temp to show you how much burns off its actual plant material and you're going to need a higher micron bag from fluent for them to get less plant material in their product to create an even better ice water hash essentially thanks again for watching Florida medical marijuana reviews", "ittK3XCDMTw": "what's up you guys it's alyssa here for another video on the king cali channel today and we are going to go ahead and try another gram of rosin by callia [Music] i think it tastes like weed [Music] thanks for watching guys this is a live rosin here so i've kept this in the freezer at home i have it on an ice pack here because i'm visiting lizzy and jesse today i kept it in a little ice pack bag today so that way i could come down here and now i've had it out for a few minutes i'll open up the gram here we're gonna go ahead and use the popco this isn't the pro this is the original um puffco but the tropical rainbow colored one and we're gonna go ahead and use this one just because i didn't have the other one with me this one we're gonna go ahead open brand new now if you look this is ice cream cake this is beautiful i personally love the strain ice cream cake in flower and almost in basically almost any form of cannabis that has been coming and i love the live rosin smell because it's going to come off super sweet inside the dab here i'll give you guys a little info as well on the ice cream cake as i usually do in my videos now for thc it comes in at 69.5 activated chc it comes in really high at 78.84 it has 0.25 cbd and 84.18 cvs let's go ahead and open this up for the first time on camera here and try this out all right it's super pretty super beautiful [Music] oh this is gonna be good let's smell it when you smell it it has a really strong strong cake smell to it just really strong there oh super sweet are you guys our other friends are coming over so i'm trying to film this little video real quick i'm gonna go ahead and get into this who's making some sound we have some puppies in the background now i got this new dab tool i ordered it from gypsy stixx online on instagram it's super cute i did a little post on instagram of it if you want to see it a little more up close there's some rhinestones up here um there's a pointy side and then a little flatter side i personally for rosin do like the flat flat edge side which i'll show you guys on another dab tool i have here oh this one's going to be a little dirty but um this dab tool is a little flatter on the bottom i'm kind of like how a flathead screwdriver would be but a little thinner than that that's really usually nice for rosin and we really hate to break this up but we're going to go ahead and try it so that way we can take a dab of it in the puffco okay i was worried if it would come out too much like a shatter and just break but it doesn't it came out really smooth we're going to get a little bit bigger of a dab here and we're going to go ahead and see i can just get this straight onto the puffco right here perfect now the puffco hasn't been warmed up i haven't taken any dabs just so that i could do this dab and not worry about it melting on me as i put in the puffco and let's go ahead and set the puffco up here we're on white i'm gonna double click it so it heats up and it vibrates we're gonna let it vibrate again because this one is pink at the bottom and i have like pink accents on it it does make it kind of look pink when it lights up but it's not like the puffco pro that lizzie's here watching me film it's not like the puff gopro where i have it set up where it actually lights up pink which i think is my favorite thing but i do have it all set up here it's cute it's little we have the pink accents what more could you ask for let's go ahead and try out this ice cream cake it vibrated it's ready to go what that's really good okay at first i didn't know if i would cop or not i think man third try i'm gonna cough it's gonna make me cough um i really like this this ice cream cake is strong the aftertaste of it is really super strong you really taste the ice cream cake there it's a really strong sweet cakey flavor tastes a little cloudy and i really like that kind of just tastes like i said i like ice cream cake i like gelatos um i like wedding cakes and all that that's something that i personally prefer so i really do like the flavor of this i think that ice cream cake is really nice as well um and yeah so thank you guys so much for watching this is just a quick little video i wanted to do a review as far as the high i get from it you do instantly kind of feel like a nice little head height especially when you use it on a piece if you have it um set to go a little hotter or if you use it through a piece of glass you're going to feel like an instant kind of little headbrush from it but it's nice because it does mellow out it does smooth out it is something that um you will make you feel high for me personally when i take a dab for the next hour or two i'll feel like the main major high of it and then it'll die down um not like a blunt where it can be super instant and then it goes away or an edible where it hits you like an hour later and just stays there i thank you guys so much for watching this video if you have any questions i'll link my social media down below and thank you guys for watching this video alyssa is out bye guys", "7UR1_to9Peg": "hey you welcome to my quick review a juveniles girls this is what I do it smoke push bash and shatter - go and check them out I try I'm off for you if you like rap you will like my news alastair the show thank you for the view what's up world - manaus styles coming at you with wedding cake cannabis review check it out so I rolled up a nice thick one to try out and let's open this up I can give it a sniff test so it actually has like a really strong earthy smell but it's like really sweet too so I've tried wedding cake before but it was I think it was good loan outdoors or something it was a lot different and this is definitely grow a lot different check it out really nice bud this was five grams besides the nice joint that I rolled it pretty much came in one bud and it's a very nice bike so I like that to be honest it's a very nice bike so and it does have a bit of a sour smell as well smells good so let's light this joint top and see how good it is so it does have a very sweet like earthy taste to it but it is a little tower as well like smell I pretty much just described exactly what it tastes like what just pretty much expected if that's what it smells like I guess but it does have a very nice taste I enjoy my nose like a bit of a bubbling gum type of taste to like you know what I mean like just the normal pink bubble gum that you eat tastes pretty good so came in a really nice account and I'll give it I'll give it a nice eight and a half to a nine for the count came in a really nice account even though the wedding cake that I got before was different it was still one of my favorites and this stuff actually seems to be growing a little nicer so I think it'll be a little better it definitely tastes both the same to be honest the other one tasted more earthy than sweet and sour though but it does have a nice taste to be honest I like the both but yeah I'll give the eight and a half to nine for it now and I'll give the taste I'll give the taste like at eight nine eight and a half to a nine as well because it tasted very nice even the look of the but I'll give the look of the but like at nine to attend because it looks really nice too you can tell whoever grew it definitely know what they're doing they took their time and we're really experienced I mean I'm starting to feel really good off of this joy already we're not even halfway through it yet so if you liking this I'm gonna be putting herself first so if you didn't see it you can go over check they let him write it it was pretty good to be honest I gave that a rating think of seven or eight but this is definitely a little better than that and as I was Richard on there and I got dragon - coming I got philosopher's stone a k47 Moroccan blonde and Moroccan Rolex and more coming so that'll be here very shortly so make sure you sub to make sure that you get a chance to see those and I've got to figure it all out first and how I can set it up but I am gonna be setting up I'll give away if I get to like I think I get to like 800 subs by Christmas or something like that I'll give ten people ten grams of we like whoever subs just leave a comment so I know that you're subscribed and I'll put you in for a chance to win even like everybody that's up now obviously still has a chance to win everybody just leave a comment and then I can add you on to the list to make sure but like I said I need to figure out all the rules and everything that I can do and I'm not sure if it'll have to be in Canada or why cuz I live in Canada I'm not sure if like I could send weed to California or not if it's legal to do that or not so I have to find out if I can do all that and whatnot let me know in the comments if you know anything about any of that and let's get back to the review oh I never meant it in a while but I'll show these ocb papers out because they're biodegradable and they're really cheap they burn really well that's what I've been using the smoke quit they're very nice and they're really cheap they're like almost less less than 2 bucks I think something like that so go enjoy a vote I kind of compare them to like raw or like the blue zigzags or something like that I'd rather the skinny skinny ones but no another biodegradable stuffs pretty good so whatever helps the world right now you know what I mean oh I was talking too much just one second but yeah I'll give the wedding cake I'll give it an eight to a nine overall now I'll give it a nine every wedding cake I've tried so far it's been [ __ ] awesome I think you should try them out I definitely would recommend them you can tell that I'm feeling pretty [ __ ] good so now um you can tell that I'm feeling pretty good cuz I'm Reverend honest [ __ ] so I definitely recommend wedding cake go and try it out imma leave it there you guys have a good night thanks for watching peace hey you welcome to my quick review a juvenile cells this is what I do smoke push past and shadow to go and check them out I try them off for

then i [ __ ] up and i accidentally [ __ ] it up but anyways i'm gonna make some bubble hash on this video guys i'm gonna show you how i make it i got a 5 gallon bucket set up with all my micron bags and i'm i'm not running every single micron bag guys i'm running the 30 and the 70. the filter bag and then the work bag okay so i'm only filtering out the 70 and the 30 micron and i'm using 15 pounds of ice and buds you guys uh out these are a bunch of lowers and some trim that i have so it's hard to see but it's all frosty buds um so i have it set up now i've dropped in about already about two ounces maybe a little more than two ounces and i have another three there and it's all buds and trim guys so most it's gonna be a good yield on this one um for now i'm just gonna set it up like i said i got a layer ice i got it two ounces or three ounces of bud i'm gonna drop in another uh five pounds of ice another layer and keep layering it until i get there guys give me one second and i'll be right back with you all right guys i put in the other three and a half ounces uh all together it's about i don't know seven eight ounces something like that maybe half a pound uh but it's quite a bit of cannabis in there so i'm gonna go ahead and fill it up with water now and this is just tap water and this is uh my broomstick i just take off the broom handle and i use that as my uh as my uh mixer you can use a drill but a drill is uh too aggressive for me and it'll uh it knocks off the car film i just fill up the bucket so i see that there's uh just enough water in there to mix up all the cannabis and the water and the ice mixed together this is called the cold water extraction guys for anybody that's not familiar with this procedure and you can see there's still quite a bit of ice in there and there's just enough water in there for me to mix it around so what i'm gonna do is mix this up for about 15 to 20 minutes a little bit and i'm going to mix the ice the water and the cannabis all together and i'm going to mix the more i agitate it the more uh trichomes are going to fall off the buds guys and this green bag here is the filter bag it catches anything that makes it through this big and then after that is the actual uh the filters which is the 70 micron and the 30 micron i can actually add a little bit more ice in here because there's not enough ice all right give me one second guys all right guys i know it's hard to see that's why i brought out a flashlight but right there that's about the perfect amount of ice and cannabis mixture there's quite a bit of cannabis in there like i said and water mixture you just want it slushy you don't want it you don't want too much water in there you just want enough water to separate and agitate the material and the more you mix it and the faster you mix it the more uh more trichomes are going to knock off so you want to do this for about 20 minutes guys in about 10 minute increments so you want to do it for 10 minutes let it rest for a few minutes and then go back and hit it again and then you can do a second watch you guys this is just going to be the first wash and then yeah and then we'll go from there give me a second and then i'll bring you guys back around once i finish watching this [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] i'm just showing you guys how i mix it and how long i mix it for and how aggressive i am with it the faster you go the more you're going to knock off the trichomes but you're also going to break up a lot of the foliage and the buds as well and that's going to allow everything the more you make it the colder it gets because the ice and water mix together especially when you mix it it gets colder than ice actually is so that's how it works the process and like i said it freezes the trichomes off of all the buds and whatever filters through this first bag gets caught as far as the garbage and everything else the trichomes will fall into the different micron bags whatever you have stacked i do have them all but i don't feel necessary to run all those other microphone bags that's the 70 and the 30 i think are more than enough to filter out all of what you're going to need as far as the trichomes go try not to hit the bottom of your bag guys with your stick because you might tear it or rip it and then you'll you'll contaminate all the rest of your product just by mixing it like this will agitate it enough to knock off all the trichomes and this is pretty much like a light wash a 20-minute wash is really really light especially if you're using bud instead of trim if you're using trim you want to go a little bit more aggressive but you'll get more chloroform which means uh the green will beat screw all the material but in the end it doesn't really matter because you're gonna wash it and i'll show you when we get to that point i'll see you guys here in about 20 minutes after i'm done mixing this up all right guys i've been mixing for about 10 minutes now what i do is i pull the bag up and i just kind of drain it knock everything all the water through it and then i'll let it float back in the water and fill up the bag again and then i'll start mixing and i'll do it uh i'll let it rest for about four minutes five minutes and then i'll start mixing again guys but for now i'm gonna let all everything that i agitated settled through the filters and go through the filters and collect and then i'll see you guys here in about five minutes and we'll start to mix again all right guys it's been about five minutes i'm gonna go ahead and start mixing again and i'll do this for another 10 minutes i'll run about 5 minutes and then i'll wait a second like 30 seconds and then i'll start again it seems real repetitive but that's how you get the most out of your uh your buds or your trim as far as hashtags and then from this you can make it into rosin and you can do it a bunch of different ways to make rods you can do with the hair straightener you can do it with the iron you can do it with a hot plate and an iron sorry my cat's running around it's going crazy and by pulling up the bag guys what it does is it filters it pulls everything to the bottom and just leaves the ice and the cannabis in there and as it settles the water starts coming up underneath and you can start mixing again and there's still quite a bit of ice in there guys ice cannabis a lot of cannabis you could tell i'm not mixing it too hard because the water's like a lime green and it's not green like the color of the the leaf you don't want that to bleach through you can wash it off at the end with oral water or just tap water but give me a second we'll get to that point guys [Applause] [Applause] all right guys i'll be back with you when we go to the sifting process give me one second all right guys it's been about 10 minutes i'm still mixing it i'm gonna mix it for about another uh probably a minute and a half two minutes and then we're gonna go to the sink and i'll show you how i shift out my cannabis in my heart [Music] all right guys in order to sift out your cannabis uh these aren't necessary but they're good to have uh they're micron screens this is a 30 micron i think or 25 micron i'm not sure exactly these are 25 micron if it zooms in and focuses there we go 25 micron okay so these are 25 micron bags and what you're gonna do guys is you're gonna is i'll set it up here on my counter right there and when i'm done uh scooping it out of the bag i'll scoop it right on to there and i'll fold it over and i'll press it with the towel on the bottom of the top and it's gonna strain out all of the all of the water and it's going to leave just behind just the just the rosin just the hash so this is uh these are essential to have and you can buy them on amazon or ebay for like anywhere from uh three dollars to to fifteen dollars depending on how many you buy i usually buy them in bulk and you can buy them uh ten packs five packs uh three packs you can buy them individually uh but they're really really necessary in order to make the to sift out the hash you can you can just let it dry out on a piece of cardboard as well if you don't have any screens you can just get a piece of cardboard put it on there and just uh scrape it up after the fat on the cardboard and it'll just come right up like i said the cardboard will suck out most of the most of the water uh this is just a way to sift it out you put it on top and you squeeze it and i'll show you how that's done when we get to that process but for now we're still mixing up the hash and we're gonna give it another probably let me see if i sing zoom in if it'll clear up there we go so we're going to mix this up for about another minute and then i'll show you guys how we do the the extraction process [Applause] you you don't want to try to mix it too hard guys you don't want your material or water to fall between the bags because what will happen is it'll contaminate your hash that green bag is actually a filter bag so if anything falls in between there it'll catch it but you don't want to try to mix it too aggressive where it's splashing because the water carries a lot of hash and a lot of material and it'll contaminate your hash if it falls in between the flaps usually you're supposed to fold them over but this bucket that i have is a little bit wider than a regular five gallon bucket and these bags don't fold over so i'm just doing it like this and then you know i don't have any issues just don't uh don't don't uh don't fill your bags up too much and too much ice and where it's going to fall over or fall between your bags you don't want that to happen because it will contaminate your hash you'll have pieces of uh of bud or whatever material in your hashing and you'll see it too you can pick it out but you don't want to it's better just to do it right the first time you can even add more ice as the ice mouth when you're mixing as you can see there's not i mean there's still quite a bit of ice in there but you can add more ice and it'll freeze it even faster uh the colder bets the better that's why you keep your your fresh frozen in the freezer as soon as you trim it off the plant you put it right in the freezer and you just freeze it and that's why when you're freezing it makes it easier for it to fall off the track when you actually put it in the ice in the water all right guys we're going to go ahead and do our bag extraction i'm going to show you how that works right now let me back up my tripod and there's the other bucket that we're going to use and uh as soon as this thing clears up all right so what i do guys is i pull out my bag and it's going to filter out all the water and all the sediment all the all the hot is going to come out the bottom and i kind of mixed it up as the water is going through because it's just like stirring it up but all right guys and i'm going to go straight into another five yellow bucket so i don't use any of that hash water that's coming out the bottom because that'll go on my next run all right and this one right here is just my filter bag this catches all the trash any trash that may come through that bag or if that falls on the side so it's not really a 14 this one here is our zombie micron and it's pretty loaded i can tell you now because the water is kind of coming out fast and this bag changes pretty fast so what i do guys is i got the top just like this and i'll pull up the other bag make sure i'm not going to lose any of this water because anything that comes through this bag is going to get caught in the 30 micron any other hatch and i'll shake the bag let's see how fast that water came out because that tells me that there's some hash in this bag how much i don't know we'll see i used quite a bit of material so we'll see you don't want to let any of this water go to waste because anything that's falling out is getting caught in that second bag guys remember that we got a good little mountain here and this is actually some people prefer this bag over all the others as far as quality of the cannabis goes because uh this is the gold gold bag this is the one that comes out the most uh golden and actually i've had 30 micron come out golden too but it just depends on the material all right guys we're gonna come to the bag over here set the tripod up let's bring it up now it doesn't look like quite a bit now but once i run some water i'm going to run some water through this and all that right there is hash guys the gold selection and i'll tell you i'll show you how that looks like here in just a second give me one second so i'm going to lay the bag in there i got a cup of tap water right here i'm just going to wet the sides walls down wash any hash that got that got caught on the sides i'm going to wash it all down to the bottom screen and i'm going to shake it and it's going to all gather together in one spot um and no matter how much water you want to i probably lost a little hat from the bottom end because there might have been some 30 micron that just went down the sink but uh it's all right and now i'm gonna pick up the bag and let it all gather in the middle and i'm gonna wet it down let it catch all together just shake it this one is probably the easiest bag of hash to make because uh the micron is not so small where you can't uh or you can gather it with a 30 micron it catches everything and you have to really work at that bag right now what i'm doing is i'm just running cups of water through it and i'm washing it washing off any of that green color that may be in the hash and you guys will see that if you mix your hash too much it'll it'll actually turn your hash green now what i'm doing is i'm going to grab the bottom of the bag where the hash is at i'm squeezing it you see it and i'm going to bring up through the bag and then right there is our hash and you can see how good quality that hash is this is the creme de la creme most people like the 70 and a couple of other microns that that uh that they like but that's a good amount of hash guys if you guys ever run hash you know it takes a lot of material to make hash and you can see that this hash is actually really decent this will be really really sticky if i uh don't uh gather it real quick and put it on the on the microphone bag on the screens and i'm going to show you that process right now guys you can use a spoon or you can use a credit card or whatever you want see how that one just fell right out and you can just scoop it all on on the spoon and then just knock it down on the screen and you can even run more water through this and gather all the all the hash on here that you can't see that's real small because this stuff is like dust guys um it's just gathered together with the ice and the water and you see it after the fact is it's like a sediment and there's still hash on here guys but anyways what i wanted to show you guys about the sifting process so i got a cloth here just a regular cloth i'm gonna fold the the hash over and i'm gonna put it on the outside of both sides of the hash and i'm going to press on this guys and the water is going to get absorbed by the by the by the rag and the hash is going to be on the inside and that's your finished product guys or one of them and then you can uh you can squeeze this out a little bit more if you like um like i said i'm gonna go ahead and run the run the water through this bag and i'm gonna collect whatever i didn't miss whatever it was on there because i know there's quite a bit of quite a bit of material still in there and this is just the first wash guys this is not a aggressive wash by any means most people uh do aggressive and they wash their stuff really really really vigorously and that's where you'll get that green tint to your hash and you can wash most of it out but sometimes you can't wash it all out that's why not i try not to get that aggressive on my first wash and i try to keep it as simple as possible um so what's left in there is uh about another quarter teaspoon of hash as soon as i gather it all together but that's like i said that's pretty much the way it works guys it's not very hard it's not complicated and then i still got the 30 micron which is quite a bit too uh let me pause this video because it's getting long as hell and then uh we'll get to that all right guys i'm getting the last 30 micron bag as you can see it takes a lot to get this through because it's a it's a really really fine fine bag the 30 micron is really really small and this is what i do to get out because it it'll get real foamy as you shake it as you can see inside the bucket all the foam and uh i'll try to squeeze out as much as i can you're not supposed to do this but it just takes too long to do it any other way at least for me it does i get all impatient and i'll go to the sink here we'll open it up see how much hash we got in there and it looks like a decent amount i'm just gonna run the sink turn it half a gallon of water 16 ounces of water go through there and then uh it takes a while you got it this is the way i do it guys this is the quickest way to get it out of there and and i know it's cold that's why i clearly empty it out and then i do a little bit of tap water so it brings it down to temp um but it's not going to filter through this bag once it's uh in this bag but this is how you get off the rest of the water and it takes a while guys just be patient try not to force it through like sometimes i'll squeeze the bag the way i was doing just before i brought it up to the thing uh but this is uh the other way to get it out because if not you have to wait for it and it takes forever and even if you leave it sitting there it'll it won't drain completely you have to physically go in and drain it but once most of the water is drained you can just squeeze the bag and most of the house will be on the bottom and like i said this is a quick wash guys you can wash it three times or even four times i don't usually do it more than twice or sometimes three times it just depends on the material and how much i'm running just be patient that's all it is being patient i'll uh be back with you guys in just a second hold on all right guys look at all that hash in there i know it doesn't look like much but it's quite a bit give me one second all right guys so that's the finished product of the 30 micron it's like peanut butter but the best kind of peanut butter and this is actually more than the the 90 or 70 micron and it looks just as good that's why i really don't do any other ones and these two because they always come out really really similar and the quality is always the same if you're growing quality and you're putting quality in you'll get quality out and see how golden that is compared to that one it's very it it's barely any difference this one looks a little lighter to me but there's at least a quarter ounce right here of uh of product and it'll be real fire once it's dried and a lot of people put this under a press and press out all the water you don't have to do all that guys as long as you're putting your body weight on it and you're using the right micron screen you're gonna get all the water out and then it'll dry within 24 hours see look there's a piece of material that got through right there is that green a piece of a leaf or something went through the screen and made it through that screen but uh no biggie we can sit that out after the fact and uh i probably will i'm gonna go ahead and rinse this bag one more time run a little bit more water gather the rest of the hatch together and now i'm gonna do another maybe wash or two and i'll probably end up with about uh 10 to 18 grams of hash by the time i'm done i've cured done hash because i usually let it cure for about a week or two and then we'll have a nice uh oxidation on the outside but the inside will be nice and creamy and light colored i'll usually mix these together to be honest i usually don't uh separate them and then i'll press them into hash but everybody has their preferences on how they like the hash this is the way i do it it's real simple it's easy um you can even save this hash and break it up like some people do or you can just leave it in a ball and it'll oxidize and it'll turn into like a temple ball you can roll it and some heat with your hands or a bottle and make some even better hash full melt if you like but yeah there's a lot of ways you can a lot of things you can do with hash from edibles me my personally what i'm going to do is i'm going to press it into rosin and then use it from there and uh edibles or however i want to use it but that's the best way i like to do it because i can do my dabs smoke my oil that's how i like my oils personally but yeah so this is my process guys real simple easy it takes about an hour to do it but a little longer because this time i'm showing you the process as a step by step more or less and the bags that i use and like i say that green bag there is just a filter bag it's not it's not for any hash or anything uh the two filter bags that i do use of the 70 and the 30 micron that's it and then a filter bag to catch any junk of course and then uh the work bag which is the 30 micron which is in there in the bucket underneath the green bag because i'm still going to wash this material at least one more time but yeah that's how i do it guys so if you have any comments or anything you want to know anything let me know in the comments below have a good one stay safe and stay medicated guys have a good one", "U8WmRBnQRns": "oh [ __ ] how you guys doing today hope it's good i'll be all having a great day because i know i'm about to just got our hands on the constellation cannabis drop they're a collab with sub x boom right here we got the cush mints constellation oh

give you the terps back up a little bit yeah i mean you can see she is listening [ __ ] if i take off the light you'll see it better and nope i'm better off with the light oh man she is wet that's something you want to smell man i'll try to fix you guys up just a little tabby all right that's better all right gonna be on that girl she's my winner she's my one i love her as much as my wife probably not i love my wife more but she second second definitely in the second maybe third probably second just kidding all right let's get in dad what you guys smoking today you guys having a fire friday because hope you all are having fire fridays that's what we're gonna call fridays fire fridays oh so fire i don't even want to get into it i could almost just keep this jar like this forever and just open it up and do new little snips man i wish you guys could smell that [ __ ] literally it's like cushman's is a good name it's just literally it's like [Music] you smell like those really good like tropical mints that's what it smells like a little bit of minty a little bit of tropicalness very little gas just um oh man just look at her she is fired this [ __ ] ain't no instagram model she don't play this straight up supermodel right here uh constellation hash company out here 502 headed up by head hunter extracts he's the main extractor there he's been in the game quite a while he's back in the game even before i was in the hashmaking game in the medical field here in washington but me and him we're in the same game together we've worked with some of the same people uh dude's real solid guy shout out to him head hunter thanks for putting out some heat for washington brother uh but yeah let's get into this dab you guys are having a great day what are you guys smoking on man i ain't seen no comments you just gotta tell me what you're smoking on um but yeah let's get this dabbing let's get tarpy terpy friday got that fire friday all right wow ah [Music] oh already everywhere that's a body wrap [Music] finish i grow up oh man soaked up a little bit of water tasting whoa flavor's nice subtle sweet taste it on your tongue tasting the terps taste some tarps you know what's funny about these uh q-tips so my dog terp you don't like smoke you don't like i mean you like smelling weed and stuff like he's interested in that but he does not like smoke like he hates smoke it's understandable but these q-tips ain't worth this [ __ ] when they're just regular q-tips but man you get that uh leftover burnt oil activated oil that's been a bit activated in there for now oh boy you catch that little [ __ ] in the corner with one there's none on it i'm just like tarpy like what are you doing man and then he's done for the day i mean he goes and lays down in bed kicks back and he's just like so that's how her tarps really tarpy he likes his tarps you just don't smoke him he eats his terps eats their own eats their own oh let's keep tipping that banger oh guys cushman's constellation cannabis sub x another eight out of ten this one [Music] flavor processing all of it's at least a seven out of eight [Music] high not all that strong nice chill i still nothing to put you for you down but i give it like a six maybe seven seven for a high it's cool though i like it i'm chill i can talk to you i mean you guys can see in previous videos how much cannabis influences me when i smoke it uh sometimes i don't see that in other people i've been smoking for years like just 74 since i was 13 35 now you know it's funny you should just get high still good and stuff am i in my 30s man everything started changing like let me know if you guys noticed this stuff like you guys ever smoke so long that you notice years later like oh damn the strain or the way it was grown now don't get me wrong strains all have independent terpenes and the effects but when we have people that are always pulling things early or not pushing the plant to its full potential it's just kind of like you're only getting some of the psychoactiveness that comes with it you only get like that uh high anxiety like heart race [Music] everybody's like oh it's a sativa sometimes it's it's not probably seven times out of ten it's not even if it is a sativa i mean there's sativas that will space you out so hard and you won't know what hit you and there's sativas that will make your heart race and make you think you're having a heart attack [Music] but when the plant's grown and the resin isn't to its full potential in full maturity um you start getting those lesser desired effects in my opinion i personally like heads that are a little more amber in color because that's when you know they're good today we're getting a lot of heads that are clear and white and you're seeing that super white beach sand bubble hash or the [ __ ] super gold bubble house or the super light in color almost white level hatch and aussie let's do [Music] uh prachum not maturing and honestly it's okay i mean some flavor comes out better that way in some aspects but you know you kind of why not drop some of what you like but you get full uh full spectrum full grown uh full time or full sun full term plants wow that's a different experience man uh you want to talk about getting stoned i mean that's what that's what put you down this is very good though nice chill i like it just kind of cruising to the music but yeah that's my thoughts in my experience with all that uh do one more tab with y'all i mean i can't really get enough of this stuff it's just you just want to eat it it's like tasty terps [Music] all right turbans little turbans i don't think i'm gonna go with the name tarp anymore i don't know why i actually used it uh it's because my dog's name is turt i like saying terp a lot let's go with my old [ __ ] uh nickname smoke uh so i'll be like what up guys it's smoke here to get smoked out or whatever i don't [ __ ] know some [ __ ] like that but it's better using my real name my opinion real name is kade kind of uh doesn't roll off the tongue to me i don't know [ __ ] it [Music] together all right guys hope you have a good rest of your day let's get lifted stay high stay medicated uh [Music] oh baby a little more oh get that banger done let me know if there's a stuff you like about the videos stuff you want to see i don't know i sound like a broken record but i don't really wanna hear what you guys don't want to think don't want to see what you all think criticism's great i'm going gonna criticize myself i wanna stop saying um um i hate the damn work oh oh when the terps get you oh [ __ ] guys i hope you have a great rest your day i'm gonna stop repeating myself but uh shout out constellation cannabis so dude excitement washington sir i 502 products pick them out up at your local dispensary in washington state [ __ ] it stay turpy stay high stay lifted uh have a good night", "O2qpsWl78Wg": "well we made it to cut down this wedding cake is all done she looks mighty fine very frosty very nice very happy with it first plant down in this grill is the wedding cake fino number two so this is hanging in a four by four tent um

my hand right up against it and you can see as far as how wide it is it's basically past my bicep six foot so you know it's uh probably a little over two feet yeah i was just missing that section

pressure thanks for tuning in we're gonna be checking out some punch-drunk live rosin on today's episode of solvent les review and I've got Josh the owner of coach masters here to talk all about it and how you can even win your own Awards and what judges look for alright let's check it out today we're really excited to bring you an award-winning live rosin from cush masters in Boulder Colorado this punch-drunk is a nice combination of Bermuda punch and Mac otherwise known as miracle alien cookies - phenomenal strains that they blended together in the lab to make an entirely better creation it took home first place at the Brewster's 7/10 showdown this year and when you open the jar you can immediately tell why it caught the judges attention fruit all kinds of terpenes that are really evocative of a fruit market in South America come at you it's almost hard to tell which ones you're smelling because it's a mixture of pineapple paya maybe even watermelon looking at the consistency it's this gorgeous shiny butter mixed with sugar and you can tell that the terpenes have even started to separate ever so slightly at room temperature this strain isn't the highest in potency testing at around 74 percent THC but that's okay because it more than makes up for it and the smell and the aromas and the flavors that come along with it which we would argue are more important in most cases anyway hey everyone welcome back to solvent let's review this is Eric today we've got a really special episode got Josh from cush masters and some award-winning live rosin just to come first place at the rooster show down in the category so super excited Josh thanks for coming on the show yeah thanks for having me it's a awesome here yeah I tell me a little bit about cush masters so cush masters was a bridge anole founded in 2015 we did contract processing for you know quite a few different people in the industry and all within Colorado and then we expanded our brand outreach around 2017 and you know we're focused on connoisseur extracts and making sure that people are outputting the best quality inputs and outputs for you know come overall concentrates because it's a huge new part of and wave of the industry so we wanted to make sure that people were properly educated as they Deb as they consume as well as make sure it's some good stuff nice so you guys have been at this a little while how long have you guys been making browsing for we've been making rosin since about 2015 yeah so just so everyone knows Josh is also one of the co-owners here at pure pressure and one of the people responsible for really seeing big-time value in solvent lists a long time ago when people were making it with hair straighteners and really josh was the one that came up with the idea of how do I come up with a better press so that I can make this more viable so yeah I mean coach masters was born and you know we found and definitely a necessary need in the market for a high quality you know versatile rosin press you know what we were using just wasn't cutting it and we wanted to make sure that we could put out the best concentrates you know the same way that you know starting material creates quality extracts you know it also comes down to the machinery and the repeatability of that machinery and so you know went out and you know built the press and you know peer pressure is what it is today which is a huge blessing and it's great you know it's amazing to see everybody utilizing that technology and you know it's only getting better yeah so tell everyone a little bit about what goes into making award-winning rosin so the strain we've got today is punch-drunk which is a cross between Mac and Bermuda punch and what is Mac stand for Mac is just a strain that was bred and is it miracle alien cookies is that what we're calling cookies yeah well yeah so tell everyone a little bit more about the strain and kind of what went into this yeah so I mean both strains you know we're grown separately as their own strain and what we ended up doing they each have their own unique profile so you know each their own terpene profile their own you know necessarily bud structure features that type of stuff and trichome head structures which all take into account when you're utilizing and going in for water extraction okay because that was the first process of getting this final product right here mmm that we're about to consume here shortly so that was obviously ice water hash washed pressed when you guys were doing this is this a cross between one strain that's the punch-drunk or is it two strains have been blended together purposefully it was two strains that were blended together you know purposefully okay I'm within the Brent within the lab itself okay so they were grown separately uh-huh and then we decided the two profiles uh would create an amazing you know over what we hoped would be an amazing you know extract you know sometimes they're hit and miss you know sometimes it's harder to sell concentrate when it's a blend like that so you really have to be careful on how you mix these terpene profiles and you know don't make a flavor or something like that that somebody won't enjoy sure okay so there's there's there's some risk involved that's when you're taking a blended we're these strains wash together yes okay so you put it all together washed it and then pressed it because I've definitely heard of some companies and places where they'll wash one or the other and then they'll actually mix the heads after they've been dried but you is there a reason that you prefer that method because it's all you know one cohesive product within the bubble hash itself okay you know when you end up working with bubble hash and depending if you're in a cold room or not you know you end up getting you know those greasy patties bubble hashed a little bit harder to work with so when you have those two flavor profiles within that bud form and it's also where you're gonna have your highest terpene within those genetics itself so you know that's gonna come out in your flavors and stuff you know some are gonna be more dominant than others which is also why you got to be very careful on which ones you mix together got it so for example probably some of the gas your OGS are gonna really overpower certain blends for example exactly okay you know like even on the fruity side as well you know you're gonna end up with certain like tangerines and stuff like that to just overpower everything within extracts so your clementines and your tangerine they're gonna take over that you're making absolutely so another question I know that probably a lot of people watching are really interested in hearing about is when you're picking strains to wash well ones that are really gonna dump and be worth the time and energy to do it can you tell ahead of time like how do you know what's gonna work do you test it like what's your process there yeah I mean that's one of the you know common ash questions I think within the industry and it's you know a very challenging part of deciding on what material to choose from mm-hmm is working with the right growers I'm working with people who are open to feedback and not stuck in their ways I'll start in the garden right yes yeah definitely start in the garden you have to have a good product to work with okay and so really developing those relationships and making sure not only are they handling the products properly while they're growing it so they're not damaging the heads but also well they're packaging it up for delivery to you you know take for an example you know you just cropped all your buds and you're going into freeze them well you have a bunch of bagged stacked on top of each other that aren't necessarily frozen yet so you're gonna wait think about what that's doing to a trichome head you know it's just extremely delicate very delicate right you touch a trichome head usually you know it will explode all right yeah cool so super super interesting stuff when it comes down to actually making something that wins an award like this I mean what goes into that what are the judges looking for and in your experience having entered a couple cups and competitions and having won awards across a couple categories yeah what advice can you give for other people out there who are trying to win their own hardware here yeah I mean I think knowing your competition is really important looking at past competition sure results are also very important looking at those profiles of those strains that have won past Awards within those categories within that award so knowing what the judge is won mm-hmm and you know some competitions allow you to enter more than one per category yeah and so what that allows you to do you know normally if we enter a you know let's just say the 7 10 showdown for example which is the one that we won right here um we were allowed to enter up to 3 into whatever category we wanted we entered one into you know some of the stuff and then we entered 2 into some of the categories as well okay what are some other categories you guys are working with um just tool it around which we took first home first place home as well nice you know we did pens ok those live rosin fans of those live resin pen who live resin panel yeah and then some disposable live resin pens you know just both types of hardware okay and then we also entered wax shatter and crystalline which is diamonds so it sounds like it's probably not a bad idea to enter as many categories as your lab is able to if possible absolutely I mean your material and your products also got to be there um you know you don't want to enter something you don't think you have a valid chance of winning you know because they are very costly as well to you know be entering multiple things into multiple categories which is why we normally stay to one entry but if it's a category that you never know what the judges could be looking for or it's a newer category let's say for example rosin you know you can go with like you know like you're saying earlier the more oh gee you know dominant you know and that judge panel might be you know more of a G type of flavor profiles or the more that fruity type of profile so it gives you kind of wide range to fall within the category of the judges as well gotcha so you guys entered more than one into the Robin category is that we're saying yes we entered two into the rosin category for this strain specifically since this is what we're reviewing today the punch-drunk but if you could guess what why do you think that this one one what about this strain you know before we sample it here in a second like what's special about punch-drunk you know ever since it came out of the machine I mean even all you just knew it it was a beautiful color the clarity the smell in aroma that we are achieving off of that rosin even as its sat in the jars changing consistencies we you know just everybody in the lab kind of gradually went to it it was kind of like a natural thing and like you know we have our solvent list room which is you know separated but you know obviously with high terpenes and rosin extraction and stuff like that you can you know smell them through the doors sometimes yeah and so people are coming in and solving this room the day that we were doing this extraction and you know obviously things like that get picked up by the techniques or the texts that are working that day right when we were talking about entering this competition it was a no-brainer for us this is the one that we thought would do it but we also entered more of an OG dominant profile as well so this one's definitely on the fruitier side yeah given given the name and cross that you're describing together okay cool so let's take a look at this obviously in the video you guys are already gonna check out some sweet macros also really like this package design school got some gold foil on it yeah that's nice thank you can I can tell why people are picking that up on the shelf yeah so here's our little glass jar I'm gonna take a little sniff here so yeah it's really strong yeah like surprisingly strong when you open it I've been to you know labs all over the place done a lot of this and and this one it's just I mean it'll stink up this entire room yeah absolutely no question you're like I'm really trying to dial in it's got you know definitely the tropical fruit I mean some people if I was gonna guess it be some kind of like banana II papaya sort of smell it's hard to nestle made this one so unique you know like knowing kids put their direct finger on it it hits so many different peoples you know wants in a concentrate which was really exciting to see and it was just off to smell alone which can also give you indications yeah of what ward winning concentrates and stuff that you know could be good as other products as well so extremely stable consistency this has been sitting out today for a little while at room temperature most of the time a lot of these strains are gonna be kept in a freezer or fridge during the day and then this however you can just tell that this is really buttery its sugared up just a tiny tiny bit it's almost glistening here in the jar I mean it kind of feels like somebody brought some giant fruit bowl into the room here that we're just smelling on set natural terpenes sweat even at room temperature you know that those terpenes start to rise and separate from the actual rosin itself you know and like I was saying earlier you know the jar itself was you know so potent within the lab that every chunk up the whole place it just stinks up the entire room I mean I can't even imagine we got a graham right here you know we're talking how much were you guys pressing at a time I mean we were pressing around 80 to 120 grams at a time so before we try it because I'm really fixing to I mean I don't know how much longer I can talk about this before we give this a shot but consistency is one of the biggest things when it comes to winning awards is what you've said in the past and what we've heard from some of our other brand allies and some of our other customers can you speak to the consistency aspect especially of rosin specifically and how that matters yeah so consistency in your final product is probably one of the most important things you know especially being a lab or somebody who isn't selling it directly to that customer being on the wholesale side of that equation you know what that does is it allows you to you know no matter who's grabbing that gram within the dispensary um you know it's that gonna end up staying that consistency so making sure that you know you manipulate your material in a way before it hits the shelves so that it stays that consistency whether you're going for shatter or wax or butter or sugar or you know micro diamonds you know some Jam tech like all of those different things and consistencies those are all done within the lab so making sure that as you give it to your packagers that you have a consistent product that you're selling as a consistent product it's nice and stable yeah it's ready to go it's not changing on it so that the judges and someone who is you know buying this off the shelf is you know they're they're getting what they're seeing on the Instagram absolutely you know and that's probably one of the most important things you know for me is being able to provide the industry a consistent product awesome so cush masters is located in Boulder Colorado proud to have them here in the state so we smoke out of a couple different things on one of our previous episodes with Roz and Ryan sometimes we've got a nail we've had episodes where we're putting honey on toast today we've got a puff coke what's setting are we gonna what what do you recommend I call it low for me anything that you're smoking I like to go at a lower temperature so half frozen in general nice low temp always yeah cuz you're gonna be able to get those terpene profiles better and you know if you burn terpenes too and you have too high of a terpene rich product you can actually you know full heart right harsh yeah so you know I really like to enjoy these high quality yeah it's almost like a fine wine right we're not having our dabs medium well today okay we're we're gonna do this proper so all right let's give it a shot you want to load me up absolutely cool [Music] that's strong what are the what are the potency results on this one um so this one we got the box right here so yeah take a peek Matt just like as I'm sitting here it that that fruit that I was smelling in the jar just kind of working its way back might not like toward the back of my tongue you know sometimes certain concentrates they have like a little bit of an after flavor but man with these premium hash robins but I mean super clean and you can tell you know no throat irritation whatsoever there I mean granted I'm not someone who's taken the world's biggest abs but that's one of the biggest things for me is just it's clean I'm not coughing my brains out right now you know I can actually sit here and really let this soak in and I can enjoy it and it's just like I mean that is just really tasty stuff I mean it feels like I'm down in Central America at a fruit stand trying to pick out what pineapple or banana or you know pie I'd like to have and that's the stuff you have to hit and those profiles that you really need to you know what it's like what sounds good to you you know and it's almost like that uh technicians you know responsibilities as materials coming in to identify identify and try and work through those rows in order to achieve those high yields those flavor profile combinations all of those things to create phenomenal concentrates yeah because sometimes you know and why sometimes we do do mixes is because for run size totals for lab optimization you know sometimes you know one girl only grew you know let's say 4,000 grams of this strain and so you know we have a eight thousand twelve thousand gram capacity per run frame we go bring them together if they fit together and they mesh to go there you know why not and you know stay at full optimization yeah so I mean the the sum of parts greater than the individuals here big-time especially for this one good stuff yeah I mean the profile there is just comes together so smooth and so elegantly and like the actual almost like fruit like flavor that it gives it's like you know almost like smoothie yeah so now that we've been sitting here for a minute and I'm starting to like really feel it this is a review after all this one's really nice I'm finding that it's really relaxing it's got a pretty calming quality you know it's gonna be a it's almost like a little bit of a head huh definitely definitely a little behind the eyes in this particular one I don't get that with a lot of strains yeah but it's not overwhelming you know I wear some head high as can be you know and like it's kind of just like step back in the couch you know beat still you know not I'm here I feel lucid exactly but I'm also a lot more relaxed and I was a couple minutes ago and you know that's what we really try and hit within you know concentrates because it is such a representation of the plant and what its capabilities are yeah and you know people out there gonna experience it different ways but I can see why the judges were really pumped up about this one it is it is pretty clear once you get a chance to try it absolutely absolutely you can find us you know pretty much you can go to coach masters calm we have a map on there you know few of our local stores you know throughout the Denver metro area you know pig and whistle Northern Lights you know star bud so check the website the website you know pretty much a good majority of Colorado stores and make sure to follow these guys on Instagram they got great content its cush dot masters is that right yep awesome very final thing for we wrap up our show here for the day the award that you won that was with the rooster right yeah is the rooster they have two competitions that they do for twenty and seven time yep the two kind of holidays of our industry and 710 being oil spelled backwards and 420 I mean who knows the real jet that came up but you know it's it's cool to see them embrace the industry and actually the companies within that industry it's really awesome to be able to do recognized for your hard work I feel like that is just unanimous in other industries that's the land here it brings a lot of legitimacy to the table check out coach masters if you're in Colorado they you can get tickets to the rooster events when they come around so make sure to give them a shout out they're really fun last one we went to a temple nightclub down in Denver we all had a great time so thanks for coming on the show thank you all right thanks for tuning in guys that was some really great product so to get more solvent list reviews make sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel right here below check out the rest of the episodes and all of our great solving this videos thanks for tuning in yeah [Music]", "zw5P6DHiQYM": "yo what up YouTube alright guys I got my temp set to 175 we're just reaching temp now I just dropped it in I put in a half ounce a little more than a half ounce a bubble hash and just Keef and a bunch of hash little I say about just over a half rounds I'm barely putting any any pressure on this cuz I double begged it let the dirty your microphone screen I just don't wanna have a blowout so I'm taking my time with this low and slow letting it get to temp and then I'll let it heat up for about so you could see the rosin is already trying to melt out but I'm gonna go ahead and let it heat up make sure this the core is nice and gooey before I start to press I don't wanna have a blower like I said I I read this is a totally different way of me pressing guys I made a little like a little pocket and I uh all the rosin is gonna come out through the front every last bit of it like I said I'm not sure exactly what I should yield shouldn't be at least a quarter ounce little more than a quarter ounce maybe 10 grams of rosin and I'm done I'm hoping but we'll see but it should be a decent yield it shouldn't be anything small that's why I went ahead and I put the channels on the side of my parchment paper so that way when it starts to run down it'll actually stop at the edge here and we'll see how much comes out guys like I say I'm not putting any pressure on this the plates aren't even touching it and it's already starting to ooze out like I said it's all about the preheat on the on the on the material you don't wanna you don't want to put it in there and automatically put all kinds of pressure on it cuz you'll blow through your bags unless you're just pressing flour you can do that if you're just pressing a gram or two but if you're using bags it's the best take your time and then lower the tempt better but the product will be as far as you on the product really to be honest some plants will put out more or some pencil to put out less oil or something cloths that be some will come up or shatter like around for a little bit some other to use some of its a little a little bit older but it's still all fire it smells amazing like I said most of this should come out the front like I said I made the little pocket envelope so that way doesn't go all up the sides it pushes the drink out the front starts to cool down immediately it smells amazing really fruity I dropped in about poly four or five different grades of hash from the 80 to the 30 and everything in between she's definitely flowing and like I said I still don't have a lot of pressure on him easing her in the more that I put the faster it coming out whether I'm like I said take your time I'm only running at 175 degrees which is really really low I could have bought even went a little lower this hash was so was so good that it actually started to melt altogether just from touching it so that's how you know it's good quality hash it'll melt in your hand just from the heat of your body so far so good she's running she's looking good that's pretty good amount of well looks a little darker than than what I usually do but it's alright she smells amazing I was planning on making some edibles with this I'll use some of it to dab with as well now I'm putting all the pressure on guys it was not just I can put on I guess as a 12-time prayer so you can see all the different colors and grades of hash inside of this oil it's actually not too bad I bet you thought I'd put it out and find out Little Dipper right it smells amazing it's a big ol blood to lava I think I like this little pocket method that I did I think I'll do this again next time and Ike I say you get it pushes everything out the front I think I'll go out the sides as you can see and it's double triple layered as far as parchment paper goes so I like it I mean I've never done it before so really really good I got a nice little run and didn't quite meet the end of it but that's quite a bit of rosin guys these are my little magnets you can just see how my phone's about to die guys but hopefully you guys liked this video I'll leave it in the comments how much I pulled out in the in the final wait if you guys want to check that out but um yeah have a good one guys stay safe and stay medicated", "PG88Ezyr8cc": "hey guys youtube's been real awesome about the community guidelines so if you are over the age of 18 you're cool but if you're not please don't watch this [Music] oh [Music] [Music] my last harvest was just over a month ago and it was a pretty good bounty [Music] i had all the jars full of some big chunkers but i was also left with a bunch of small buds and shake [Music] now i'm not into eating edibles i'm more of a joint or dab kind of guy and i don't mess around with chemicals so that means bh no thank you i keep things solventless not just for health reasons but honestly it's it's for the terp reasons i do it for the terps sullivanless is is the bee's knees now that does leave me with two options nice water hash extraction aka good old-fashioned bubble hash or that's a good one using gravity in these dry sift screens aka dry sifting [Music] [Applause] so in the past i've had my share of bubble runs okay the bubble wrap itself always goes smooth especially since i always work with fresh material that wasn't too old for harvest [Music] the yields and the color was it was on point all good signs of some decent quality bubble hash but when it came time to the drying process that's where i noticed a lot of that nice color being lost i was drawing the bubble hash in these boxes and leaving them by an ac unit and dehumidifier [Music] just like that grind it down microplane it i even started to microplane the bubble first just to see if that would help the process but i still noticed the hash go from amazing top shelf color to looking like well looking like some dark moroccan ash once it was all dried and i noticed this happening on every run i would pull great color but dry the hash into dark chocolate and if i press that bubble into rosin i would just end up with some bad color hash rosin ultimately it wasn't working but i didn't know where the kink was and it was the drying phase [Music] i was told i needed a dry freezer so you know i went online to see what that was all about and uh it was all about five thousand dollars for one which is very expensive piece of equipment and i'm not sure i have the balls to commit to a purchase like that at this point i would almost want to have an entire room dedicated to hash for that to be viable and i simply don't have the room and i'm certainly not sacrificing my gym space [Music] despite my lack of quality when it came to drying bubble i did have another option these dry sift screens [Music] this method uses gravity and agitation and since i was working with material that was already dry i didn't have to sacrifice any loss when it came to quality [Music] and of course this quality would spew out on the rosin press i'm happy oh look at the color that's fresh off the press color bro yeah that's really nice now on all my hash videos i always get a few comments from someone who like doesn't really dab and and they will comment why press the dry sift into rosin seems like a big waste i just smoke it in bowls and joints that's completely fine makes sense if you're not into dabbing but the reason why i like to press it into hash rosin is because it creates a more concentrated version of hash after all i am starting with trim which isn't very strong [Music] just for the heck of it let's just say between 10 i don't know maybe 20 in thc and then of course when we break that down through the dry sift screens we are left with obviously less weight but also a stronger product that could be i don't know once again just for example 50 [Music] thc and if we grab that tricep and press it into rosin we are once again creating a more concentrated version upwards of 70 thc for example once again i'm making these numbers up but this is kind of how it goes [Music] and since i do keep things solving this right from the beginning the hash horizon not only packs an incredible punch but it also has a starburst of terps when it comes to the taste and by the way that does not mean i'm not going to keep some of the dry sift for supercharging joints so i'm about to start my first run aka the quick bounce method i'm just using the one screen the 110 mesh count aka 149 micron i'm pretty sure honestly the conversions can sometimes get confusing but i'm pretty sure that's right now to make this entire process as efficient as can be i'm grabbing my dry material directly from the freezer and quickly dropping it onto the screen the material needs to be bone dry and frozen two key factors in increasing the dry sift yields this first run is supposed to be quick with minimum agitation i don't want to overwork the material break it down too much causing contaminants to go through creating a less melty first run dry sift quick clean and i'm removing all the material off the screen before i place more down now i do want to mention that this is in no way advice on how to dry sift guys i'm simply just showing you what i do with my leftovers from harvest take from it what you will if you really want to do a deep dive into the dry sifting world there is a lot more to learn from static dry sifting to different karting tech i'm honestly just showing what i do in honestly the least technical way possible i guess this is just how i quickly clean and collect some heads from my trim if you're one of those crazy [ __ ] that want to know more about dry sifting just check out channels like mark the bubble man or even john berfello there's a few of them out there that go pretty deep into all the different styles of dry sifting a lot more deeper into what i'm doing the first run is always a rewarding one the fact that i can spend as short as 10 minutes dropping shake onto screens and have such a pretty pile of some first run almost full melt sift it's pretty [ __ ] a-okay with me so today i am doing a second run now for this second run i haven't always used the four screens sometimes i just use the one screen only the 110 mesh and i just work the material longer however there is a nice little extra filtering effect when rocking all four dry sift screens the very top screen is called the working screen and it's 60 mesh count aka 250 micron the second screen is 90 mesh count which is 190 micron the third screen is 110 mesh count which is 149 micron in the bottom yellow screen is 200 mesh cal which is 74 micron so on the second run i will work the material on the top screen for anywhere between one and three minutes before discarding into my trim bin now this is something i wish i could say i thought of myself but it was a friend actually he came over one night and was like dude pull the bin out this is another way to catch some additional heads which other words would be lost if you know i discard it into a bin like i used to i've ran all my material through the top working screen and now i'm down to the 90 mesh count aka 190 micron [Music] into the naked eye this big pile of dry sift looks pretty clean but looks can be deceiving after a few minutes of lightly carting back and forth a lot of the heads fall through to the bottom screen and was left on top of the 190 micron screen is dirty [Music] contaminants [Music] and finally getting down to the bottom 200 mesh count aka 74 micron screen where i have myself a pretty darn clean pile of heads [Applause] drop a like if you uh if you like rick and morty hopefully there's a billion likes on this video because of that for this second dry sift run um i spent 30 to 40 minutes probably in totality working the material and what was left on the very bottom 74 micron screen aka 200 mesh count for anyone who's keeping track uh was a pile of dry sift that totaled 30 something grams roughly like 31 grams and i would call this dry sift half melt status this is not full melty melt amazing dry sift this is just amazing dry sift that's half melt that was a bad analogy you can take that polish and implement other cleaning strategies like static dry sifting and or the carting tech you can use those two as options to clean up a dirty palace sift so if you are like me and you do want to press some of the dry sift that you managed to collect into rosin well cool over the years i've done double begging tech where i would grab the 25 micron bag from rosin evolution and stuff that inside a 160 micron bag and the only reason why i was doing double bagging tech was just to avoid or reduce my chances of actually having a blowout honestly it freaking sucks when you have a blowout when you're pressing your hash it's like it's not really something you can salvage if you have a blowout the hash will literally spew out of the rosin press like it's taking a [ __ ] gnarly [ __ ] and it's just unfortunate because it's like ruined and it was something that happened a lot when i was uh rosin pressing earlier on that's why i used to use a double banking tech and it would reduce the chances kind of of having a blow up but what i also noticed was i was still having blowouts bro because i was just coming down too quick too fast when i take so much time off and then come back to pressing rosin you kind of have to like relearn the the nuances of everything so as of recently i have just been using the 125 micron bag for pressing my hash and when i do get it into the press i just take i don't want to say take my sweet time coming down with the pressure because the longer it's in the press the more degraded the hash can end up so there is like a sweet spot when it comes to pressing the hash super low time too no blowout i'm happy oh look at the color that's fresh off the press color bruh that's right what i've noticed is i come down too quick and i end up with a blowout so that's kind of why i take my sweet time uh increasing the pressure it's just to avoid the huge hiccup of having that [ __ ] blowout man [Music] now on instagram i've seen a few people like they are yielding like 80 return off the bubble they are pressing into rosin and i've never been close to 80 returns i've done 50 and 60 returns but never more [Music] and i've done this a few times i've never had anything spew 80 percent return something something was in my mouth that was weird i just had a bunch of chickens jesus christ swear to god my [ __ ] tits are getting too big for this shirt one thing i do regret about the sif screens that i purchased is the overall size these are 12 by 24 inches and honestly when i bought them i thought this was the right decision i'm just a home gardener i'm not some commercial op but that was a mistake it honestly was a mistake i should have opted for at least the one size up if not just should have got just shoulda woulda but coulda but didn't i should have got the two by three feet size screens which are [ __ ] mammoth but honestly worth it should have done it didn't you can um still make work of the larger screens even in a smaller scale operation that's what i'm trying to get at took me an entire [ __ ] paragraph to okay episode two of the closet series will be coming out next i'm going to basically start working on the video the second this one's done i am sorry for the massive delays i have not just one grow up i have actually multiple grows right now all going which are all being documented heavily from seed to harvest and i've been trying to keep them under wrap however i'm not doing a good job at that because i'm telling you guys about them right now oh my rick and morty poster fell down perfect so we are at the correct height for optimal dabbing just want to say if you're still watching this video to like the video because you know it's a pretty long video and if you're still watching it that means you like me [ __ ] also subscribe for better wheat this rig i think is called decline recycler i think i'm not gonna lie i'm not too sure so if you know exactly what kind of rig this is to drop it down below i have not taken a dab from this particular rig in probably a hot year hot year why do i say things so weird it's been over a year since taking a dab off this rig my go-to rigs as of recently have been um bottle rigs for some reason i just really like the way they chug and um also probably because they are the newest you know pieces to my collection so i've been you know going ham on those bottle rigs but they do chug like a [ __ ] [Music] first dab of the day okay that first dab was [ __ ] so we're gonna do another dab here um [ __ ] [Music] oh [Music] that was a little hot it [ __ ] still had a lot of flavor it wasn't too too hot it's just a little hot i am [ __ ] high right now holy [ __ ] hey guys thank you so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it um please don't forget to like subscribe and of course what else [Music] i'm really stoned and like i can see some dust on my lens and i'm i just i can't help but think that you can see the dust freckle you", "adMUJRGqIP8": "everyone welcome to my jar Tech tutorial well not really jar take away my version of jar attack the reason I say that is because there's a bunch of ways you can do quote-unquote jar tech but the way I like it is to make the material really buttery and really hard so what I do to get that material pretty much all I've done so far is I squish seven grams of flour I put it it got it from the parchment and with my tool and I've put it on to a jar with no lid in between plates and it's out 1:29 and sitting at that for about 10 minutes so I'll come back to you guys and probably about half an hour to an hour once that's a little bit more buttered up so I can whip it and I'll let you guys know what I mean by whipping it then because you can see that's already kinda starting to butter up and that's what we want but we're gonna let it go for about another half hour to an hour so see you guys yep so what I have done here is I've pretty much just taken a little dab tours you can see right there there's now a little bit dirty and I've just stirred this rosin around I noticed that one part was getting really buttery but the rest was staying really runny I actually even noticed that it's trying to build like some sort of I mean try to zoom in there some sort of like little diamonds or like some hard pieces of rosin super-dope but um as you can see it's been whipped now and I'm just gonna put it right back in here this was about half a minute back this was about half an hour in that we whipped it so once again it's just insane out 1:29 it's been in there for about half an hour we just whipped it pretty much stuck a the blossom stick in there and stirred it around mixed it up for about 30 seconds to a minute and then put it right back on the plates and now we're going to sit there for maybe another hour maybe another 30 minutes I'll be back to you guys when that's 1020 minutes from the last video maybe I don't know 30 minutes in - after the whip as you can see we're having very nice crystallization you can see him some big diamonds starting to form we're gonna let this keep going let it keep buttering up and so they could keep doing its thing beautiful we're probably about an hour in since the last video and what I have here pretty much is a very stable a little bit buttery you can see the Terps popping up on top but it's pretty much starting to harden up and as you can see this is that consistently and see I said I wanted from the beginning although I'm still gonna let it go for probably about another half hour or so everyone and how's it going this is pretty much all finished up I started at 11:53 it's now 147 so probably took like a little over two hours I don't know but this is pretty much then the results as I like it this is very hard all of this pretty much puffed up and became very solid like it's all butter and that's how I like my rosin so if you guys don't like it like that you could have left it at the point where it's diamonds or whatever but once again this is just a little tutorial on how I like to do my rosin tag and the kind of results I like to go for kind of things I do and how I do it but yeah guys this is an official tutorial if you guys want any of things I used pretty much all I used was unlocks master unit two heaped up to press the rosin and to heat it up and if you guys want you can use this kind of code yeah I'm stoned and I'll save you guys a bunch of money on these presses or on DeYoung the mini that I used because this is where I made the rosin so I'm yeah if you guys more a mini or alex master you in there like that just discount code yeah I'm stoned one word you guys will be able to save some money at Knox Master Lock yeah guys it's the finished product I hope you enjoyed and thanks for watching", "s-o9xGf_ucE": "[Music] what's going on guys it's knives here and today i'm bringing you another stream review this time wedding cake so according to wikileaf.com wedding cake sometimes known as pink cookies or birthday cake is a strain that leans on some very popular genetics to yield a balance high and a dynamic taste it's a cross between sour hybrid cherry pie and the universally appealing girl scout cookies this is an indica dominant hybrid that should be treated with an extra dose of care due to its extremely high thc content so this is a nug that i'm going to be working with today i was going to give it a 10 but you can see that there's quite a few leaves left on there and a little bit of stem poking out at the bottom so i'm going to give it an eight because it still does look really good you can see that it looks almost white because it's covered in trichomes so for looks from me is getting an eight let's move on to smell a bit closed to me this smells a lot like the gelato like it's got the sweetness mixed with like the earthiness but something about it's a little bit different i think that the wedding cake smells a little bit more gassy than the gelato the gelato smells really sweet with a little bit of gassy underneath but this one smells gassier and that's why it's very similar but this one's just a little bit better for me so i'm giving that an 8 as well so i'm going to go grind up some of this and see how it smells open so i've got a little tiny bit of this just here in my grinder the rest of it i rolled up into my joint um and it smells a lot sweeter when it's ground up but still really gassy it smells quite creamy it's really nice for um for it ground up i'm gonna give it a nine we're just gonna bump it up to an 8.5 overall for the smell smells really nice all right so here's one i rolled earlier um we're gonna pop on it dry to see how it tastes that's really really good it's really creamy it tastes like almost like cream cakes that's what i want to say it tastes kind of like a vanilla slice [Music] with like a petrolly creamy undertone it's really really weird but it's really good days for it only it's going to get 9.5 from me because that is really [ __ ] good if you can get this strain i recommend that you try it just to hit it dry to be honest um it's not good so i'm gonna spot this up and see what the high is like this is actually my wake and bake it's about 1 30ish i was actually [ __ ] spot on then it's one well not quite spot on it's 133 so i was pretty accurate this is my wake and bake i've been up since about about 11 but yeah this is my first smoke of the day [Music] so right away that flavor's really kind of weird it's it's sweet sweetness hits you right off the bat [Music] it's creamy it's a lot creamier than the gelato and i thought that one was pretty [ __ ] creamy so this tastes really nice but like also kind of strange [Music] for someone for someone like me who doesn't often get a choice on what weed they get um and the quality of it's usually not very good for example um i know places where i can get half ounces for 60 pound if that gives you any idea and it's not like bottom grade but it's not the best stuff like it's smokable for somebody like me who gets weird like that having some wedding cake like this is really a nice experience because you can actually taste things that's not just burning plant matter it's it's nice yeah [Music] it's the creaminess that gets me there's a little bit of fruitiness on top of it but it's mainly creamy and gassy and i prefer gassier stuff rather than fruity stuff because i prefer the high that it gives you i'm sorry i just completely lost my train of thought yeah it's really creamy but it's gassy as well and i like that so flavor of it lit for me yeah it's getting an eight from me again i feel like this is going to be the highest score in australia it is burning nice and white ash as well i literally just ashed it as i was thinking hey this is nice let me actually show it to the camera um yeah so i'm just going to jump straight into the rating to be honest with me usually i would knock it down for that but this is this strain is just so nice that i'm not going to do that so for the look of the bud it's getting an eight um if i just pulled off those leaves it probably would have got nine but i do like my blood but it's got a bit of purple in it i know it doesn't affect it but it just looks prettier when it's got purple in it for some reason but yeah still it's getting eight um the smell of it closed gets i think i said to 7.5 and the smell of it open 8.5 i'm probably just completely rescoring so i should write it down but i don't yeah and then taste for it [Music] dry is getting a 9.5 and the taste of it late is getting an 8.5 so i'm gonna average it about an 8.5 it's not however just work really but in my head it's getting an 8.5 it's really nice it's really creamy i feel really [ __ ] stoned i'm gonna go and sit down for a bit so um yeah if you like this video please leave a like leave me a comment telling me if you tried this strain uh subscribe for more videos i think we're at 64. so if we keep going up like one a day one a week could be good i'm not picky you know as long as it keeps going up um yeah thank you for watching [Music] you", "Ie5Qg2A6I7g": "what's up guys we're here in the chronic kitchen where as you know we make great food and even better Rossi what's up guys we're back and we're gonna do something super special it's the holiday season we're doing Rasen infused snowball cookies we have our rosin right here it's about a gram we just pressed this we pressed about 4.1 grams of a motorbreath and we got about 1.1 grams back that's super high yield we did the math about 27% we just pressed it using the next Smasher XP the XP is great because of the pressure gauge we did this at about 700 725 material pressure that's pretty light for doing flour but we wanted to keep it light to get that really clean looking product back we did about 205 206 degrees you know not too hot not too cold and we left in about 200 seconds that's a you know longer time than usual but because of that lower pressure you can add a little bit more time get that good yield back and that clean results so we're really excited to deke are with the mini today this is our number one selling product everybody has a mini right now and we just came out with an expansion mini D carb this thing makes activating your rosin super easy so get yours now just came out we're gonna throw our rods and in that mini D carb we're gonna put in the Nook Smasher mini 250 degrees 25 minutes we're gonna do that and then we'll get started making those snowball cookies what's up everybody this is chef Eric here at the crown and kitchenware today for our holiday recipe we're going to be making snowball cookies absolutely my most favorite cookie of all time there are sometimes called Mexican wedding cookies but they're basically buttery and delicious shortbread cookies that are covered in powdered sugar and we're gonna make ours even more delicious today by adding in the fabulous motorbreath rose and then we have d carving right over there we have about eight hundred and twenty-five milligrams of THC be carving over there and the batch we're making today's 418 cookies so you're going to end up with about 46 milligrams of THC per cookie give or take some see how it goes when you make this recipe just make sure that your total amount of rosin is divided by 18 so you can get your portions just about right because you don't want to be givin people too much or too little I think that the 825 we're gonna have is gonna be just perfect cuz I know I'm gonna be eaten probably the whole batch so if you are ready I'm ready I'm super excited let's get to cookin [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right everybody welcome back I for one I'm super excited to try these cookies I wasn't lying when I said these were my favorites so just a word again about dosage remember there was about eight hundred and twenty five milligrams in that entire batch so each one of these cookies has roughly forty six milligrams if you have a low tolerance like some of the people in the office do around here they're not eating these because they are just right in the face

some different rosin I just got this gorilla glue rosin back from my boy who vac purged it for me because basically I collected on top of some dry ice and so the rosin collected moisture so you threw it in the back of him for me and as you can see at that fire fire looks really good really nice color see right through it so there's that one and again people will say that looks dark but it's funny because this is a gram actually this is a little over a gram and this is the same thing straight up clear but yeah oh the dust and the hair and it that people think right my shits clean so there's that right and then this will give you a different view so there's that and then I've got some of this gorilla glue which is the stuff that I've been smoking on for the past couple weeks and this is a thick little puck right here but it just goes to show you kind of the different consistency that you can get there's kind of squeezing this down just from how stuff cures you know this stuff is more stable and then I've also got some black sugar rose rosin that I pressed out earlier today it's a really low yield err so I don't really do it often but I got a gram and a half off of just under 10 grams so that's what I normally get around 12 to 16 percent of the range I think I've pulled on it it's got just a really cool color to it it's really stable grab this here you get y'all just breaks off so it's super stable and so I'm gonna go ahead and actually take a hit off of that I'm gonna go ahead and close up this big guy here close that up and that's about 36 grams right there so I'm gonna try and get you guys a cool shot of me pretty much dabbing this and the clean email hopefully I can cut through here clean get a nice strip off broke all right so you guys can see what that looks like and let's see if I can get this for you and this is fire [Music] superbomb super stable all right peace out", "q1h99BNz0KE": "recreational 420 and today we're gonna check out this tangi ice hash Rosen from Ken Arroyo now this stuff is new completely new for me I've never had ice hash rasen I think the only other brand that I've even seen that has this is a hundred bucks a gram so for me that was always out of the price range this isn't quite that expensive so I'm definitely excited about trying it and with that the top right into it so the numbers here are THC comes in at 61.7 let me see if there's anything okay so 61.7 is of THC Maxx CBD is at 0.98 was CBD Maxx coming in a 2.84 and yeah that's about all the info there is on there personally I'd like to see th ca and true THC just so that I can actually run the numbers and make sure that that number is actually accurate but that's just a personal thing for me the back is just a you know the sticker and the rest of the stuff this kind of explains a little bit about the company tells you a little bit about what they do how they grow their stuff and all of that good stuff with that I'm gonna go ahead and pop this guy open so these guys this is your seal so what you want to do is pull that little sticker off and then there you go I hope this time I can blow maybe maybe that was all for nothing how do I get this out like a kid on Christmas that's how all right so good thing I kept the numbers intact so that I can write down my stuff anyway so this is what it looks like I'm gonna go ahead and bust this thing open ooh so in here's a little bit of uh I'm guessing this is silicon oh man the smell on this it smells like a straight-up orange of like orange peel God what are those well like a tangerine there you go I was like why does it smell it smells like a really fruity Orange what is that called oh yeah tangerine so this smells just like it's supposed to oh I wish I would have brought in something here somewhat of like a little poker or something I have this that I can kind of so here we go this is the consistency it's nice and like waxy almost this is weird like for rosin especially from this company if you look at the last videos of their rosin this isn't at all what it looks like so I'm really really stoked and with that I'm gonna shut up and I'm just gonna go try this I'll be back with you guys in a couple days to let you know how this one hey guys what's up so I went ahead and tried that tangi and it was really good so on the way in all the way through from the tongue all the way to the back of the throat you get this really strong orange like tangerine flavor and then on the exhale there's a little bit of a musky linger on the tongue nothing too crazy just just enough of like a different note I guess to dimension and then the hi itself is a really it's a sativa for sure it's a little bit of lifting overall like you get happy energetic or a little bit energetic not too crazy on the energy but definitely really really big on the happy euphoric like you're really giddy just a really happy uplifting high I guess is the way I would describe this if you're a new cannabis consumer and you want to go try concentrates this would be a great one especially if you're somebody who's maybe played around with a flower a little bit and you know that you like sativas if you wanted to like maybe take the leap into concentrates this would be an excellent choice because it's not too overwhelming for you that like you're gonna feel weird and uncomfortable it'll just be a really good like taste into the concentrate world and with that if you guys liked this go ahead and hit that sub button I'll be back again with you guys in a couple of days and yeah I'll see you guys

absolutely thanks so much for having us out we we really love being there yeah yeah okay so Levi is gonna be my source I've talked it to naazy I've talked to a few people and you're gonna be my source for a freeze dryer or at least you're gonna be my information source right now because I'm a little bit confused what I'm thinking about is I got this greenhouse coming down count aloud 1015 pounds whatever the hell we get from it different strains and I want to make some something good out of them something a little bit better than just shatter I was thinking about the laws man I can't have 15 pounds right but I can take 15 pounds and wash it down to I don't know a few ounces or a half a pound or something like that that would be legally okay no yeah yeah correct yeah I mean as long as you're lifting your your your legal jurisdictions whatever local jurisdictions that you have yeah that can definitely help cut down your total weight now if I'm thinking about it because I am a little bit of a public figure if the cops were watching me and listening to what I said if I was blasting this all with butane is that technically illegal or am I able to do that yeah yeah by far technically illegal yeah okay okay so that's where the rosin press comes in so if I wanted to play by the rules I could press you press this match pressing twelve or fifteen pounds of flour seems a little ridiculous and I'm kind of setting you up for the softball because we don't press flour correct well so you can for a simplicity sake right it's you know for commercial operations is a very easy skewer to throw on on the shelves for home users who just shop at dispensaries it's really nice just because you can go grab some flour I'm from a hair straightener stepping on a hair straightener all the way up mm presses so oh yeah you can but it is quite a bit of work if you're talking 15 pounds or whatever it is then yes yeah yeah you would much prefer pressing the hash equivalent of that it's not alive too big big key to sink your pressing flour you're pressing dried cured flour not like fresh frozen flour so that's what I wanted to get into so the difference remaking shatter and making live or live rosin is that everything has to stay cold right everything has to be frozen so we're gonna harvest it wet we're gonna instantly freeze it and then we're going to wash it in and then once we freeze it we can take our time take out some you know half pound at a time wash it in bubble bags or a bubble machine and that's where I'm a little bit confused so I've got my sifted water hash that comes out of the bubble machine how do I keep that life yeah so the best thing that you can do is as soon as you've washed it is to you've got two options the old-school way would be to freeze it and then microplane it and what you're trying to achieve there is a long-term slow dry so that can range from four to about seven days within a humidity and temperature control room okay so you've got a microplane what you explained micro planning yeah so micro micro planning it would just be freezing the bubble hash that you take out of your bags right and then at when it's frozen you're taking essentially like a grater a sifter and you're sifting it up on to a lot of people use cardboard but what you're doing is that you're trying to break it up into small pieces so it can air dry over a slow period of time on within this time you know you do experience a little bit of oxidization right they start to see things get a little bit darker versus using a free char and that gets me into the second option which would be just slapping it in a freeze dryer and that process pretty much she you pull a deep freeze on the product ranging from you can adjust your times anywhere from about seven to ten hours and that matters seven to ten hours I mean I can't freeze it for a month so you you can't actually freeze it for however long you really wish okay but the the freezer ours they are a little and they're a little bit on the pricier side yeah so it's not something that I would want to run over a long term unless you have to you know so a more conventional freezer would be a little bit more suited if you want to freeze for freeze that hash specifically for you know 24 hours or a week or whatever it is before you can actually do your full freeze drying process all right then yeah that makes sense all right so we got to the where I've got the bubble and I'm putting it in the freeze dryer now so now I just I leave it for what a day a week yeah so you've got essentially two times that on the freeze dryer that are important to you there's there's a free cycle and a dry cycle so the first part of the freeze dryer is to deep freeze the entire product right so seven hours for most product is is plenty depending on what you want to do guy so let's say seven hours there and then there is a dry cycle at the end which there is a vacuum pump and it pulls vacuum on the chamber and then there are trays within the freeze dryer that warm up slightly to allow for the tip furnace for the moisture to evaporate out of the product out of your wet hash and then it pulls a vacuum and it cycles through that so and we're not talking about we're not talking about evaporation here this is sublimation we're going directly from liquid solid to a gas and going away and what evaporation is solid to the liquid gonna do it yes mmm-hmm interesting and it'll take chemistry yeah then so you're just opening up that drain valve and whatever moisture you collected that has been sucked into the they'll just drains out so that is the water from your from your hash all right so then the last step after and how long how long does it take to do that how long do I collect into the drive yeah the dry cycle is usually around 10 to 12 hours okay longer if you've got a large freeze dryer and you're burning it up with a ton of hash if you've got full trains yeah you can easily turn that into 24 hours or so okay okay so then I want to get to the last step because you've given me the whole process I really appreciate you taking the time to do this but the last step is we gotta press it in a rosin press and this is to make you know super high-quality live or awesome am I wrong is that the last step and we just immediately take it out of the freeze dryer and do that or how's that work correct so you know depending on what kind of micron bags you're using ranging from 70 to 90 maybe up to a hundred micron okay first it could actually be full milk so if that's what you prefer you can pull those those microns out for full no and those will typically it's only your first wash that they'll be that they'll be full milk but everything else it can be squished into inter hash frozen just like you mentioned and how many washes do you do out of a bubble teas and bubble bags and the bubble later mmm machine yeah it depends on how much agitation you're getting with with washing machines are getting quite a bit more agitation right 10 or 15 minutes and you can run up to about five washes if you want but at the end at those fourth and fifth maybe even six washes if you're just trying to get everything out they're gonna be the lower quality more contaminated product and you're gonna receive less yield per wash what I'm what type of yield like on a total throughout the six washes you do on like a half pound what type of yields would be looking at so pretty much what most people like to refer to is just to rosin percentage yield so let's say and this is all fresh frozen so good yields would be considered like three to five percent range to rosin off with fresh frozen weight so you just have to run the numbers off that so if it's no 1/2 sorry what was the numbers again just let's do two pounds max is that's 900 grams what can what do we get off that yeah so you do have to remember that's not that's fresh frozen right that's only obvious that's what all the water weight still in the cannabis cheese that's not it dried at all yet so we're gonna have to give all that away and because we'd be correct so yeah if you have two pounds of fresh frozen that would be 900 grams right and let's say you got back a really good yield it's the genetics are good certain really grown you did a good extraction on it let's say to rosin you get three percent yield on that okay so that would be 90 grams yeah it would actually be 27 see why I don't do math with mana right that's why you hold on to the money all right sure all right so 27 grams out of out of okay that's not a 2 pounds of fresh frozen I mean but 2 pounds of fresh frozen Jesus that's gotta be like a half pound to a third of a pound of dried flower yeah yeah approximately they say if I'm not mistaken it's somewhere around you lose about 80% of the weight if I didn't say it I was gonna yes somewhere around eighty percent of the total way around all right all right so I'm thinking this alright so here the reason we were bullshitting is because I'm like alright so if I do this what's my investment you know what's the ROI I just went and bought a gram at the dispensary for $55 for a gram of live resin or like yeah is even live resin not life awesome I do find the rosin have a little bit more flavor I dig them a little bit more I like the consistency too it's easier to dab but um so I'm just thinking if I'm buying $50.00 grams a gram really doesn't last all that long might be cool to have a year's worth of worth of a live rosin hey you got a separate fridge I did some quick math of that 80% water weight chair go away when you dry it right if you if you dried it to that dry weight that's 15 percent of the driveway well which is 15 percent return to live hash rosin that doesn't make sense 15 percent active ingredient on some really Bank bud and and the 85 percent is no material plant material yeah definitely makes sense yeah and I mean you'd be lucky to on a large scale to get that kind of return off of dry pressing flowers and it's not going to be nearly the same quality bubble hash rosin as a rule of thumb is significantly better and quality than flower roses agree with you more Sarah tried both and there's a huge difference yeah yeah exactly all right so come on help me out what's my investment here so I need a freeze dryer first off bubble bags and the bubble later you guys sell them so we actually just started carrying bulk bags okay yeah so we really like those just for the the Frenchy full mil full mesh bags okay I really like those and they've got washing machines as well yeah so what do I got a couple hundred maybe three hundred bucks and a washing machine or some bubble bags yeah yeah you could always depending on the size so you can get down to five gallon right right to about 42 gallon bags [ __ ] as bit larger it's more material so it gets quite a bit more expensive but all in all on bags you don't even need a machine if you don't want to right let me just go with a bucket I with a spoon man my buddy used to make the a locking gank with a wooden spoon brother yeah yeah so you can you can really kick it very primitively and it doesn't take a lot of money to get started it just as you start to scale and trying to do larger and larger amounts to become more efficient that's when it starts costing a little bit extra money sure so we got so we could just end it right there if you want to buy a bubble later bubble machine and some bags or even just some bags and use a five-gallon bucket and some ice you can make really good water hash that way I will tell you the more you beat it the lesser quality is so if you're really gentle with it you can make some dank dabba bull I don't know if it's full milk but it's close whatever is not full melt you can just throw in a hair straightener thrown or press right over you impress that so you could press press that now what if we just want to go there and say hey I'm going to invest a little bit of money for quality and buy a good rosin press help me out I see him for 400 bucks tell me what the difference is between that I don't you see you don't sell no $400 presses do um so so actually how we started our business was that that smaller range I go for three to five hundred dollars just with the cage kids the plate kids at the time everybody was stepping on hair straighteners and everybody was trying to figure out how to scale so they were using the t-shirt presses in there right and then you know just growing up in Kansas and and seeing a lot of these shop presses around I figured why not adapt one of these to a rosin press so that's essentially how we started and the more recently Lucius made the more commercial setups and and higher processing and higher quality systems which are which are the V twos as of currently and so yeah you've got pressure gauges external palms you can operate them through electric means air hand you know they're open source so you choose exactly how you want to apply your force nice yep all right so so if we got a rising press what's it gonna cost us man for a good one yeah for for kind of a beginners home user setup that you wanna you know something that's portable all american-made lifetime warranty I mean the thing is bulletproof it's you know it's gonna last you a lifetime sure how many times is that so up to 20 tons which is 40,000 pounds of force so more force than you ever need but it's nice to have in your back pocket if you ever you know stacking multiple chips and doing a final extraction right what do we press that what's what's the force we press it yeah for the the force for flowers you're looking anywhere from about 1,500 to 2,500 plate and PS I got and platon psi is something that that it takes a small equation to get there but the formulas on our website if you just want to check that out but yeah that's how it breaks down and then for hash awesome you're looking anywhere from 800 to up to 2500 plate psi again got it so it's overkill what you what you're giving them yeah for sure alright and so what's that running come on what's that run my friend prices yeah brother come on DBC price yeah so if you're just if you want to start off with our intro systems those start at 397 that just sticks on any press in your choice this is a really good home user setup but for the more you say press you can go to harbor you're saying like a harbor freight pump or whatever I don't understand what do you mean yes yes that's the actual Harbor Freight brain okay guys so the downside of those is that they're a little bit larger so you may want to set it up and in the garage if you set it up in your living room if you have a girlfriend or wife they're not gonna like it good all right next the exercise bike man you'll be fine I'm sad that's all right so all right so right wow so this is pretty cool so I got a few hundred bucks in the bowl bags for 400 bucks I can get a press so so you telling me a home press yep yep and then if you want to go with something that's a lot more portable you're about ten inches tall you can just throw a bottle jack in those and they're really portable so if you're if you're hopping around from buddies houses to sessions or whatever on it you know you can tote that around with you those start around $1,000 that's shipping and taxes include all right so I'm thinking abut for under a G if I wanted to be a starter for under a G I could start making my own rosin correct yeah yeah you can even make bubble hash rosin for the air thousand bucks yeah and then so here's the big jump man you know me man I always want to go high-end I said I don't always want to go high-end but in my cannabis I do so if I want to go live with then I've got to go with a freeze dryer right mm-hmm yeah yeah so the main advantages of the freeze dryer is to quickly dry your material right so it doesn't leave loose terpenes is that when you lose the terpenes absolutely so if you're just air drying within a room you're also beating the heads up whenever you're doing that aggressive sifting you know that the micro cleaning that I mentioned earlier right so yeah it's a it's just a much better process you're keeping it cold so hence the live rosin aspect your because all you're doing is freezing it and then and then just getting that moisture out pulling a vacuum so while it's cold never really exposed to heat and it's much quicker as well yeah all right but that's a big [ __ ] step up man we're talking another couple grand if I want to get in get into the live business right yeah I'm minimum minimum so the only company that that makes free strives for our industry is gonna be harvest right and they make products ranging from 2,000 up to about 8,000 to like that still is very very very cheap compared to all other freeze drivers on the market because they're like full-on lab great equipment is that what the deal is medical grade stuff it's yeah it's pharmaceutical grade stuffs at it you know most of those machines will start around $30,000 so harvest rights really fulfilled a nice niche in the market for people like us oh very cool very cool although starting a - jeez man damn yeah I get that I get that yeah by the way so what you we were talking about if you don't if you're just drying bubble hash or freeze drying bubble hash guru doesn't let me say drying he gets my own estate but if you just freeze trying to bubble hash you don't need a huge freeze dryer right Yeah right right and so pretty much you've got you've got three different sizes you've got the small the medium and a large been on for most people for most small grows you get away with a smaller a medium I how small is it small so the small is the actual sizes on this guy so it's around a hundred and ten pounds and you can fit approximately two to three wet pounds of bubble hash inside of it no sweat that's a [ __ ] shitload man yeah yeah I mean that dries down to two to a portion of that sure but still yeah I mean that'll fit quite a bit you know that's full trays right yeah you can never make it work all right that soon what seems legit man it seems like okay I'm gonna figure for a solution for a home solution two grand three grants I've got about 3,500 bucks if I want to be in the live business no correct yeah I mean of course you can always hair dry right but yeah you're going to lose the live aspect of the of the rosin but don't make me get my calculator out but if fifty dollars a gram a bit guru could do this one is hit but at fifty dollars a gram how long has it taken it what do you got sixty sixty grams in order to recover that ROI if you're paying fifty dollars a gram at a dispensary you make 60 grams of live live rosin a it's great it be I've got five or six different strains in there and and B I cover my three grant you know I guess a three grand investment you could cover with three grand you don't have to spend in the dispensary anymore what sort of bet you I would spend it you know a couple hundred bucks go to that dispenser every couple weeks man yeah yeah yeah and it makes sense for for home growers for quite a few home growers if you are a heavy smoker or if you're supplying your friends and family that kind of definitely helps yeah definitely if you steal your buddies live rosin and tell them that you'll pay him back yeah yeah I guess still gurus live rosin for the air you know it becomes a prop at that point I love it I love it it cool man all right so I figured some [ __ ] out I appreciate it yeah I just wanted to share with the DG see you and I were texting back and forth yesterday and I was like man let's just do this for the DGC there's some really good information there you pumped it out by the way I really appreciate it Levi right on yeah absolutely and and you know as always we're just trying to put out a lot of information just to help everybody out because I understand it is really overwhelming at first trying to

sure well man take it easy brother yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] we're the pill to do [Music] true medicine [Music] Oh he hates the day [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]", "OKEKEKltvjo": "yo what up youtube all right guys here we are in the two by four under the two aglex 1200s um so far we are what these things [ __ ] i didn't even get the dates off the thing that's a [ __ ] mistake by me um well i have the date somewhere around here just gotta find it but i wouldn't say they're a month maybe four weeks old i'm just gonna go up and say four weeks old yeah i don't know something like that guys but uh we're doing pretty good in here i out potted everything uh everything's been in one gallons those been back there i've been in one gallons for about a week now and these ones just got into the one gallons a few days ago uh roughly four days ago so that's been in there for about two weeks now and this one's been there for roughly four days now um i'm going through the plants right now guys i got to refill the humidifier 72 35 that thing's not very accurate but that's why i have my uh my goober in here so i have it on my phone gotta check that here in a little bit but um not too shabby in here guys it's doing pretty good uh i did give everything a feed yesterday or not yesterday day before that some [ __ ] like that let me see uh yeah the day before yesterday i got to go ahead and get some more water today and then i'll come in here and give these things some recharge um if you guys don't know i do use recharge for the microbial life um i do need to give me a new bag here soon only if you guys can see through it but you can see i'm running pretty light um i use about a half a teaspoon i have a spoon in here that i just pick up i just dump in the gallons but um i'm gonna go off on a limb and say i think this right here is a female let me see um it looks like it's growing calyxes instead of uh balls so that's why i say i think it's a female it's got a nice calyx going right here so but then even on this one right here too it's got uh some calyxes here uh it's not really starting folks but it's got some calyxes there guys so i think these phenol one and two are females um by the way this one's growing out right here guys honestly it's looking like a male um i haven't let me see yeah i don't see no sex on this one yet guys but uh it seems to be growing out like a male but uh we'll see what happens with it it's doing pretty good actually i like not too bad um and then this one right here this one's got some [ __ ] up ass leaves for some reason although um everything in here has been topped they're growing out of their tops real nicely this one's still not showing any types of sex or anything like that yet and then this one i don't think showing sexy this one's got a nice decent two tops also um yeah i'm not sure on any of these other ones i don't think they're showing any types of anything yet but uh everything in here doing really good guys uh i just now uh i [ __ ] i i don't think i told you guys yet but i have um [Music] three autoflowers outside i just want to finish trimming up one of the uh what is this the purple scoops that i had some decent buds guys um this is all wet trimmed i just finished trimming it today not today just like five minutes ago um so i'm gonna let this dry out for a few days and i'm gonna be turning this all into some flower rosin so yeah guys i'm definitely gonna be showing you guys what that looks like after but these buds are looking real frosty guys real real frosty even the trimming i had to throw the trimming in the freezer real quick because it was some real frosty trimmings guys so i like about these rock butt autos they don't they throw a lot of [ __ ] trichomes out real nice uh but right here it looks looks pretty decent i'm guessing around two ounces maybe uh just off of a if not two ounces in about an ounce and a half off of uh the auto it's been growing outside in the cold weather for the past few days not even past few days actually [ __ ] this past month it's been outside for uh it's not been cold cold but it uh it's been cold you know it's not [ __ ] negative it's not under 30 degrees at night but it's still uh it gets cold and it's cold during the day so uh yeah i have two others out there i have a passion punch also and uh the cheese auto still guys uh those are still out there doing really good uh definitely can't wait to see what happens the passion punch is starting to pack on weight now so she's doing pretty nice uh smells really awesome um but yeah guys and then uh got a new dish into the to the family besides the dog got me uh me and my girlfriend we had gotten us a little kitty been wanting one and this is what we got it's a little baby apollo a little fatty uh just he's tired he just woke up i guess i will come up um but yeah guys uh i'm gonna go ahead and show you guys the four by four real quick with the autoflowers that i have in there um everything and they're starting to do really good now so i just go ahead and give me a second i'll go and show you guys give me one second all right guys here we are on the 4x4 mars hydro tent with the uh mars hydra's p150 and the sunrise sqb 1000 with a total of like 340 watts yeah now 240 watts yeah yeah 240 watts guys um right here is the rock auto mix i'm not going to do any training to their freebies the freebies i would just let grow out so this one and this purple bastard eaters over here i'm not going to do any training too i'm just going to let them grow and see what happens and then right here what is this oh this is another purple scoop right there guys i'm going to go ahead and water them later on tonight with some probably give them a recharge or feeding one or the other um but this [ __ ] purpose passion punch right here guys this old passion punch looks terrible i don't know if you guys think probably you guys probably see it but [ __ ] hell look at that guys i've grown four [ __ ] seeds from that pack and this is the only one that i've seen grow like that uh so yeah i don't know right here we have the great mints 23 looking stellar looking nice for it being a few days old um these things took forever i still have this this is the uh i'm surprised this seed made it the seeds didn't make it guys i don't know what the hell and i threw it in water they didn't germinate so i threw one in water and it's popped after i had germinated after i germinated it twice or something like that i don't know but it finally [ __ ] popped so i threw it in dirt and it's right here guys so we have this little tiny one let's see what happens with it and then right here we have the uh grape slurry uh the grape slurpee actually uh it's starting to flower uh we're in pre-flower right now guys if you guys can't tell she's starting to throw pistols turn you could tell by the light green on the nose that she's starting to stretch and do her thing got a few nice decent tops on here um i do defoliate my autoflowers guys i do uh pick leafs off like see these ain't even worth nothing right here just take them off people probably gonna yell at me but um that's what i do i don't i'm not worried about these these are some high quality autoflowers that i purchase so uh i expect the best out of the best you know especially when i go around and uh take leaves off i don't expect them to hurt them or nothing like that um i could have probably pulled this out a little bit but that's how you know it's been flowering because it wasn't this big the other day it was it was only an inch or two now it's good three inches and then right here is the ah this is the grape dosa breath that i topped guys um i need to go ahead and tie this slide down but look at that we got a pretty [ __ ] even canopy right here got one two three four five and there's another one right here six seven eight a good eight tops on her um i'm gonna go ahead and tie this other side down from this top but i'm gonna let it do its thing after that i'll probably pull them out after but we're doing really good on this one uh not too bad guys it's female so uh not too bad we're gonna let it uh flower out when it's ready and it should be a decent [ __ ] 12 inch 13 inch plant we'll hopefully see but yeah don't know if you guys could really see here she's doing really good and then right here is the purple rock berry uh she's starting the flower also um trading down the same way as the other one i didn't get it to go out as long but we got some pretty decent tops on here got this is gonna be a nice cola for sure got me some two other ones over here and some decent ones right here so it won't be too bad we'll get a decent yield off of those i usually get an ounce and a half off my autoflowers um that's like at the minimum um i think the least i've gotten was a half ounce because my autoflowers outside that i first started out there and i guess it just stunted them because i germinated inside or whatnot but uh whatever we'll do again next year um definitely but yeah guys this the mars hydro tank is kicking ass right now um not too shabby uh yeah guys i did give the ones in the back i did give the ones in the back are you feeding the ones that are flowering right now i did give them feeding uh the other day that one's still a little wet but i think they do need to be watered and everything in here needs to be watered again tonight and then uh yeah i'm definitely gonna go ahead and give these a few uh feeding in another few days again after they dry out all the pots uh for their flower transitioning because they're already in flower switching to it um so yeah guys should be not too bad in here in a few days uh next week is going to be a lot different so uh yeah guys uh go ahead and wait next week see what happens up in here because autoflowers progress pretty fast so yeah let me go ahead and take you guys back to the room real quick and then uh yeah i'm definitely gonna be pressing this flower right here into some uh damn it looks like booboo i need a new camera guys but yeah guys and then this right here i'm gonna be uh this whole tent uh when when it's ready for a flower which i'm still not gonna be thinking of flour for another month or so or not not even another month i'm gonna let these get some decent-sized plants because i will be making uh i will be turning this batch into some flower uh to some fresh frozen hash rosin uh some blackberry moonshine bx1 flash fresh flower hash rosin um i can't wait i'm pretty stoked i will be taking clones off i will run this uh just blackberry moonshine a few times uh definitely keep me a next uh one for next year because i'm gonna run it outside also um but yeah guys i'm gonna go ahead and let you guys go baby apollo uh but yeah guys don't forget to like and subscribe and talk to me in the comments you know let me know what you guys think i'm going to catch you guys next week later", "Ur61k7_EK7I": "what I found being a wife out here making some bubble hash off of the wedding cake right wedding cake yes wedding cake [ __ ] or was it was it was wedding cake [ __ ] from Grandma that we had got not that impressive of a yield but the quality is there yes no bubble no these colors look very very nice so everybody pretty much has a tutorial on how to make the wash you don't know how to do it just put in bow wash and but I will give a shout out to bubble bags and bubble man because he helped out with creating this quality we're here also the bubble now machine that thing is the bomb it pays for itself the first yes so worth having if you're into hash doing it yourself definitely yeah this is the first run and we're gonna do another wash even though it's not that greater yield it's just what the quality that's there is definitely worth the second wash so we'll be back would uh would around to here in a minute", "x_pLE1s1-Rk": "all right a little disclaimer before we start the video if you guys hear the fire alarms charlie ignore it like it's what I'm saying totally ignore that we changed all the smoke detectors batteries and there's still one that's going like beeping and we don't know which one and we've changed all of them so who knows okay just ignore it period hi guys welcome back to my channel if you're new here go ahead and smash the like button comment down below subscribe turn on those post notifications to be not quite every single time we post a new video today as you can see I do have the Eric the aircon piece that I will be heating out of and I'm finally trying some live rosin purrs you like rosin from 7-10 laughs and this is 7:10 Kim times or delicious alright here's our label gives us our THC percentage and all the info or whatever and I just noticed the way this packaging do you open it which is so cool it's like a little proposing like a there's like a ring in here I feel like I'll be proposed to right now again it says Oh juice make better oh geez okay Anna says davit low temperatures for ultimate experience okay I see you sometimes packaging this specific live rosin ranges from $80 to 105 dollars let's go ahead and open it up now this is my time so what you guys are seeing and what I'm seeing is the very first time so we're both looking at this packaging for the first time together whoa I really just open it and I can smell it whoa I look sick I've never smoked rosin before and I've never seen how rosin looks in my life look in person I mean say hello [ __ ] with diamonds from wrong garden but live rosin is like the period purest sauce and dab like you can go to rather than you know it's much purer than shadow sugar and all this so we gonna see what the real game is about today also the texture of this isn't something like I've never had before it just feels kind of like I'm looking at it slightly and it's pretty cool I can tell that's much harder and it's gonna be easier to pick up most likely you won't be falling I hope this is a good size and not too much because like I have said before I have never tried rosin I have never tried rosin and I'm barely starting to get into dabbing and all this stuff you know tears guys that was really good it was very smooth so she could sizes the size of it because I feel like that was a pretty good size for me maybe more but it's wrong Tiffani smooth not much residue I can see that there is a little bit of oil left over maybe I should we keep that Hey I think this has so far been one of the best flavors that I have tried like its energy enjoyable flavor the taste that you get once you're smelling it and exhaling it like you can really get the flavor of it Connell I want to see like the light on the lemony side probably taste good I think we need another guys who do you think and the dad were you guys having it with me hope you guys are enjoying your day wherever and whatever you guys are doing and whatever time it is I hope they they're blazing up with me another day of cosmas you know celebrating fortunately every day this one he's filming it like I said and yeah honestly the only reason why I got this one was because of the name bootylicious like that's what attracted me bootylicious that's how I usually pick up products by the names of it like or if it looks really nice the product like the weed or so or the name that it sound like like something I've never heard and it's crazy how I know this is out of a lot of topic but it's crazy how there's so many means to so many different things like bootylicious amnesia cream crack they come out with like the home just cannabis indices mind-blowing and like I always say this it's just it's more than just smoking it it's more than you're just getting tired it's a process to everything like rolling a joint there's a process to it you have to grind it up you have to roll to packing a cone you have to grind a you have to get your stuff for you have to stuff it you have to know when to stuff a because if not it'll be to lose a bong rip you know it's just a process I don't know it's enjoyable I just I enjoy it at first when I excited to dab I didn't really like it I didn't really [ __ ] with him because the whole process thing it was just like a hassle it was just like it's too much it's too much work so I'm not gonna do it and I rather just stick to something quick like a cartridge that's on the go you know I wasn't appreciating the process but now I just I really appreciate and I really like I just love having it I don't wanna put that out there I love that me now even though I'm not the biggest ever but let's go ahead and take a mother dad this is my second Dabba this is the size of it cheers guys are you rate someone to attend mm-hmm a 7/10 hell yeah hell yeah they're fired damn and I can like taste like the pureness like he's so even though it was like having me coughing it is I didn't give me like an after I know when I'm gonna take a big hit and sometimes after they hate your it all feels like very raspy I'm not feeling that like I'm just thirsty cuz I haven't drank water but the hit smooth mm-hmm I feel like in every dab you always say so smooth but by far this one has to be the smoothest I would definitely go ahead and buy this product again even if it's it ranges up to a hundred five dollars I I [ __ ] with it I [ __ ] with it this definitely convinced me you guys have been I haven't seen some comments back a few months ago I reviewed their courts and I actually like did not get the best review out of it I'm guessing I had a falsie battery or I don't know what happened but I did see a few of you mentioning that well it's like 7/10 has like the best cards or whatever like they're fire you know the fire you're like this definitely has made me want to try their products again like hurt and battery because I feel like I they could have done better but the rosin sauce definitely I would purchase again on with a heartbeat like yeah cuz this is hard to find as well and they stopped quit I wasn't even gonna end up getting this when I went to this one three whenever I went to the dispensary didn't have it and right when we were about to leave they actually stopped a permit so your likes back and we've had to get it well I hope you guys enjoyed this video and I hope you guys were getting high with me and I will see you guys until the next day of Christmas don't forget to sure knowledge for sonification see you guys can be notified every single time I post a new

second backup channel my videos are getting better karma pop is saying my videos are getting better thank you so much it's fun making them say I definitely enjoy that [ __ ] probably hungry huh yes thank you so much I appreciate that a lot did you bring me your ball oh my god you're so smart let me feed you done we're smashing it and indeed smashing it it's you smashing it all right doggie is bad way back yeah he'll jump on me eventually cuz it kind of freaks out when I talk to the camera for long at a time I noticed some the second lives are the first live stream also happen Andy you're heading out much love if you don't know what I'm dabbing now some sappy live resin I'll probably have a video on it eventually but it's uh it's called dayglo it's a local growers own but turned into the librarian you don't know the difference between live rosin and hash rosin I'll try to explain it explain it so with ash rosin somebody that knows their [ __ ] uh probably okay basically passed rosin is made from taking fresh bud like a large amount of it and depending on the way you make it you could it's two different way so I'll explain the the water hash way so you can make hash rosin by agitating a bunch of weed with water and shaking it up and straining it into bags so like the trichomes fall off into the bottom of each bag you scrape that let it dry out and then you take that product and you smash it on the rosin presses something like what I have and that's how you make hash doesn't like this [ __ ] it's all super pure solvent Lissa doesn't take any chemicals like most wax like has butane co2 or propane in it to extract it but any type of rosin is solving this no chemicals no [ __ ] other than heat and pressure water but then with life rosin slightly different hash rosin me made with the hash of the weed this is made from fresh fresh buds they're probably super fresh right off the plant frozen and then thrown in a nut Smasher like that it depends the type of weed it varies I've press stuff at the same exact temperatures and you can get many different variations of colors like super dark putty or [ __ ] you could get light color like super shatter II stuff she's still here yeah yeah it's cool didn't like good types of weed and being able to press it and figure out the types of consistencies because some weed doesn't press good at all another strength and steel [ __ ] get like the best best looking [ __ ] lighting color claiming this stuff is so shattering though that's sort of saying that hash are not hash causing any type of rasa specifically rosin from pressing nugs neither can have crazy different textures and stuff this one's super shattering it's been out of the fridge for weeks and it's still okay had to get the tool hot to get it off with the did it I did it a dad time do balls about to pass out Duvall one more DAP time and you could you have my blessing to fall asleep angel say dad time one move over one dad time yes captain sleep tight my friend just might be my last stab out of this pretty toasty hour-and-a-half is what I was probably gonna do in a song sick oh those real taste holy [ __ ] b-ball good night man thank

__ ] the word the 7-letter word dab time I so harmless just you just say it dab time and Duval does it but that was just unnecessary oh yeah I'm definitely gonna go die in peace guys it's a good good one I'm guessing I've Andy caramel and Duval possibly I'll have four people [ __ ] if I get another like again but if not I'm gonna say peace have time this is an easy thing to say that if you can't tell cry and I also threw up a bit a lot of it [ __ ] that was amazing I'm gonna finish my crack which is an ice cream right now hmm holy [ __ ] I was heavy get down good I'm all right oh yeah I'm

like when people show their buds on the camera I don't think they're going that frosty this but six weeks are six months coming on five months five that bud is five months old right here this Bud's five months old so this isn't like it's recently cropped or anything and it hasn't been put in a tuna can or something like that and put on a shelf this has been banged around and shake beat up you

patients get good quality medicine at a price that they can afford and i am trying to help in that respect so here is our quarter get this thing all put into a nice little package and move these lights up here and get this placed right where i want it to be there we go that paper of course anytime you're doing live stuff okay all right so let's get that out of the way and get this centered up where i want it to be get the light in there on it real good so you can see it get real close and put it right there all right here we go let's get this valve closed on the pump let's make some medicine there's nothing i enjoy more right now than just getting the best that this flower can offer and as long as you treat this plant with respect she will give herself to give you the best medicine that you can have much better quality than anything you will get in the dispensary as a concentrate solidness is definitely the way to go and rosin whether it be hash rosin or flower rosin is a step way bigger than any of the commercially available chemically extracted concentrates so let's just remember where the quality is and the flavor because this is a full spectrum extract and take terpenes and winterize it do all kinds of crazy stuff they just you just get the buds and the essence of them their soul that's the way i like to approach it so as you can see it's going to get harder and harder to see so i'm going to let this go now and start concentrating on this press i'm going to let that heat soak in for about 30 seconds before i finish get the full pressure i don't know if there's any big drops tomorrow for the weekend but i would be watching the healing center my tree rise all of those guys because you know how that goes friday if you get a big drop and if you're not ready to grab it online you can lose out real easy all right almost at pressure there we go that's where i want to be with it let it sit there for a minute i'm going to pull this shot back out oh yeah this should be fun so again moxie doesn't come out with a lot of flour they've been coming out with more lately and i don't get a chance to press much of it because it's usually at the high end of the price spectrum not a lot of patients bring it to me so i figured i'd grab some and we'll see what see what it does you know and there isn't a whole lot else you can do except uh try it and it goes into my database you find out how it stacks up against the other grower processors and the other strains that they're putting out so i'm just getting the scale ready i already have a jar make sure i get the tear on that first seventeen yep that's great okay are you ready you ready to see it here we go okay viper cookies what'd you give us oh oh yes oh yeah i'll tell you what take a look at that that looks mighty mighty fine to me so let us get that paper off of here turn off the i am done pressing unless unless there's a patient that comes over with something for me let me get the shot out and redirected all right a small blowout no big deal take my tools here clean a little bit of clean rosin off the end of that but like i said blowouts happen no matter whose bag you're using luckily they don't happen all the time so let's get this fired up tara and philip she looks like a happy plant this thing was coming off looking like it was made from washed flour uh and that it didn't just come from straight flour some of this consistency is very reminiscent of a lot of hash rosin i see being shown on ig gas rosin's fantastic it's just not practical for medical patients in pennsylvania because of our prices you know so pennsylvania and the medical marijuana program flower rosin is king of solidness because you can't get the good stuff good ash rosin at the dispensers they don't sell it they don't make it people who do make it aren't making it for the legal market so best you're gonna get medicine wise from somebody who can craft it immediately for you somebody like me who's doing flower rosin just like this gotta love this plant with all your heart to be good at doing this consistently you got to be having access to flour that is of amazing quality to get this kind of result oh this stuff came out so beautiful oh yeah oh moxie my good friend dave perlow gabe pirlo who is the ceo of moxie he and i have had a very nice relationship as far as his business ideas about doing solventless believe me when the feds lift the the lid off this whole thing and deschedule this plant you're gonna start seeing a lot more solventless on the market because it will be on the recreational side probably but you will see it moxie has always been a concentrate centric company it started off they didn't have the canopy enough to to sell flowers so all they sold were their really nice concentrates and their cartridges i love their cartridges liquid moxies melon wreck is awesome ellerange is fantastic a big fan of their distillate cartridges but their flowers always been kind of rare you know now they're stepping up their their production ability and now they're coming out with more flour which is really cool so let's see what we got for a yield and wow 0.61 well when you take away the 17 grams for the jar that is well that is not what i would consider an acceptable yield okay again my bare minimum acceptable yield is half half a gram per eight this comes out to be point three per eighth which i mean here's the thing though the quality is amazing okay and in terms of the look of it it smells incredible you know but there it is maybe i can get it you can see the better light i mean look at the quality of that there's no disputing the fact that moxie makes really good flour the problem is the flour that they make or that they grow doesn't have the wax and lipid profiles to make them a good candidate for solventless extraction via rosin press so always bear in mind that when you're going to buy flour you need to pick strains that work for you and you have to be willing to accept that you may get a strain like this like this viper cookies which looks to be amazing probably going to taste incredible uh but the yield is not sufficient for for me from for me personally it may be for you as a patient you may be a baller and can afford to buy enough eights to get enough of this pressed to make it worth medicating with it i tend to look for the higher producing strains i think this is an excellent strain i bet it's a great strain for the other uses dry vaping quote unquote um but for rosin it's one i would probably take a pass on personally but if you're seeing this and you're liking what you see grab yourself some dispensary flower and get on over here to penn hills and come and see me and i will do this for you too stay safe stay medicated be good to each other everybody have a good day", "nTUn5e_sSE0": "hi guys kind of lovely here the IG canna critic doing a review today on our and our brothers rasen the boys up on the hill we're so kind enough to give me a sample of their hash Drazen using my dab stick court step stick bought at the local head shop gives me a nice great taste of this new to the industry oil what's the deal with rasen rasen is solvent less you basically have a great press and you screw [ __ ] in a certain amount of time collecting all the great cannabinoid resin trichomes and the terpenes which make rasen taste is fantastic if you haven't tried rasen i definitely think you should I did run out and try by a press and try to make some myself didn't exactly work the way I wanted it to so is it worth the money to me absolutely I am a connoisseur all the way and I believe if I could ever find a way to go solventless I was gonna be in love I love the fresh frozen I love the hash rasen I think it's a great new solution to butane co2 blowing stuff up people who can't have those kinds of opportunities that for them this is a press and I love the fact that you can squish it so that's my two cents I'm sure everybody's got their own opinions on it and shout out give me a review back letting me know what you think comment below and if you haven't tried it please go out and try fresh rasen or hash rasen pressed solventless dabs waxes oils whatever you want to call it it's called rasen give it a try today", "bHogbUekh7o": "[Music] i oh [Music] [Music] so [Music] do [Music] [Music] two [Music] oh [Music] you", "jzrxix3h6SI": "what's going on everybody sorry it's been a minute but we back back in action uh it's 2021 new year more fears uh but [ __ ] it we're smoking ash so [Music] let's just get high come talk to you about some uh sunny days sunny days cannabis out of uh washington state another 502. now the great pacific northwest um all the oh yeah all led grown buds uh the flower and the resins pretty on point really like everything they put out my favorite so far been that uh tropicana punch that stuff was oh stuff was tarpy terps but today we got seriously citrus and this stuff it's like a orange hazy yeah like an orange hazy something so maybe like a tangerine haze cross i don't know almost smell like some almost like that jack but not it's on the verge i don't like jack but this is this is tasty i enjoy it uh sunday bat cross is a sunday driver back cross this stuff just the flavor consistency and everything it's like a nice og oh it's just damn she pretty it's nice and wet wet wet same as the seriously citrus those are nice and wet all cold cure batters uh the solar flare not sure on the genetics but this one's nice i see you got a little bit of sweet undertone on it nice battery not as wet but still still pretty good terps are there it still has some glisten to it it sweats a bit i already tossed a seriously uh citrus up in the puffco but honestly can't say anything bad about these guys and for the price anywhere from 45 to 50 a gram perfect that's where they should stay i just say honestly you should stay at the 45 and just beat out everybody because this product right here is all full spec i'm not gonna lie i don't mind some full spec [ __ ] especially if it's terpe and i honestly no problem with full sets uh pulse back period because full spec rosin full spec anything you just getting all the compounds of the plane you're not getting just you know pure heads or not pure heads but uh i like the super fine hash or like the 90 micron or 120 um you're getting all of it but so you getting everything that that plan had to offer in my eyes uh definitely had a hash but this stuff is primo definitely uh my eyes they beat out constellation um yeah the zeus or the sauce whatever the hell they're called take those guys out uh dings are very good i like them um if these guys had the material didn't it i'd probably like their product their end product a little better maybe that's just me but i don't know i think their process is a little more on point uh what else does that say about them well they're kind of just like an underdog little small batch stuff and that's what it's all about it's all about that small batch you get the large bed something yeah you can get some cool resin out of it for sure um i ain't gonna bang on it it's good stuff but sunday seriously solar flare tropicana mr nasty gas station i've had almost all the flavors and they're all all pretty good the mojito i've had a few that are a little dark no kinda like hey there's been wonders too that i haven't me and them eye to eye with but hey it's better than being a 75 or more a gram and getting something you're like oh yeah it smells great and everything and then kind of tastes like [ __ ] but all these straight tastes well tastes nice tarpy uh tastes reminiscent of the flour it's all very good very well done i can't complain get the puffco going uh so purple setting is i think 535 degrees kind of like what i like to keep it with the hash unless it's like really terpene i might drop it down to 525 and then probably rip on it through a couple times because sometimes that flavor just burns off and goes to good but it depends on the product and and what what was all done with it cheers ma'am damn it's like orange sweethearts hmm that's why you little puffco man the thing just keeps popping [Music] man stuff hits like a brick nice and smooth though that's what else i like about they're all pesticide free no sprays no cams no that [ __ ] but the thing i haven't noticed about this led grown as it's uh i don't know if it's just their growing technique or what but this stuff is so clean like it burns so nice um not that it just burns nice the flavors there it holds and uh it's smooth like there ain't nothing smoother than this hash i mean there probably is but i'm just saying in washington wreck this stuff's [ __ ] smooth smooth like it's like i don't know i don't choke on it like i do some other people stuff um the sunday driver back cross this stuff straight og man like it smells like some other [ __ ] og it's like some emoji got a small amount of sweetness to it and just knocks you on your ass like this one got me because this guy is really gonna get me what you guys been smoking on lately throw down in the comments if you're from washington tell me what you've been uh puffing on do you guys get the new puffco this puffco pros it is filthy uh yeah she's ready all right sunday driver back cross cheers fam damn that's a garuka funk baby that garuka funk [Music] oh that one choked me up wow oh damn all right yeah all right man lungs throw just coated in tarps and in that garuka funk that's my new word when someone just gotta get them tarps some of that terps just boom [ __ ] slap you that's the garuka funk if you don't know about the grookophone you need to get on that garuka phone that one got me high don't forget to q to my uh the puffco yeah i smoke on this popco like a daily driver some days sometimes just so nice don't get me wrong i still still mess with the heavy glass just just on that uh new age tech i never messed with the first version puffco i never really liked them i always heard they broke down and there's issues and this and that and all this [ __ ] but like i said if they came out with another version it was more upgraded i'd be down and lo and behold it took a few years but it came and i'm thoroughly impressed this thing is definitely awesome for travel too oh all right well [ __ ] those were fire i am devastated i'll put up another video probably tomorrow the next day but i learned that go out olympia we goes where i secured the bag sunday they have them all go check them out uh it's up at freedom i don't know where else right now oh buddies buddies renting but i hope you guys have a great day happy 2021 it's gonna be a bumpy ride real bumpy but just get high smoke some hash we'll all be good all right fam you have a good one peace you", "o7yToj8NgbU": "yes i am going to be pressing two strains of flour today picked them up at the healing center in monroeville big shout out to them and what we have today are some really nice strains i hope they press out really well we're going to find out because we're pressing 180. first one we're going to press is the cresco this is the pineapple express ringing in at 30 percent it has been rehydrated with hydrostones i'll take those out now and we shall get this ready to press hope everybody is staying safe staying medicated and being good to each other out there if you are a medical marijuana patient the pittsburgh area and you would like to have your dispensary flower pressed into rosin i do that for free for patients right here in penn hills at asher's finest rosin world headquarters it's been a long day folks i am so glad to finally be getting down to getting some pressing done uh so that's that's it that's our quarter and let me see that these new uh press bags okay those are not the right size all right here we go i do believe that that should handle i could have sworn i got three different sizes nope just two okay because here's the size difference from a seven gram bag right there so let me see if this more suitable now this is what happens when you go live stuff happens and not everything is perfect those are the wow i am just having a heck of a day today it has been pouring down rain almost the entire day today okay so that's the one closest matches the size and so these are made by gutenberg's tank pressing and they they had those custom made to emulate as close as possible a nug smasher seven gram bag and i think they got it down pretty good but let's take a look and see how these hold up under the press my crd 30 ton rosin press so there's 120 micron bag we're pressing at 180 degrees uh this is the i haven't pressed pineapple express from cresco in probably two years so we shall see what it's going to do hopefully it's going to press out well at 30 percent i'm really hoping it will but you know as well as i do sometimes the thc level does not equate to a larger yield if the plant doesn't have the right wax and lipid profile so just trying to let you know what happens in the real world we're either going to get a really good result or not and we'll see what the quality of this flower is for the price i really hope it's good because quite frankly it i've gotten surprised by some of the flower lately that should have been good producers and were not but i give everyone their chance i try not to pre-judge anything uh this is really really sticky uh especially now that it's been rehydrated which is a good sign this all tucked down in here nice and tight and we're gonna get it all folded up here and we're gonna move the lights and put it on the plates and see what she's got for us hope she gushes that would be super nice get a really nice happy happy squish out of this we shall see this is video one of the two video series today pressing dispensary flower pennsylvania medical flower from our local wonderful dispensary here the healing center in monroeville i'm gonna move the camera now move it into a better angle for you to see what's going on okay let's let's get this here blow there we go put you right in here and focus is right there all right let's start dropping the hammer on this and see what she's gonna do like i said if you're a pittsburgh area medical marijuana patient you have dispensary flour you want to press bring it over to penn hills that's where i live real easy to get a hold of if you hit me on a private messenger i give you my address and i will do this for you for free because that's what i do for patients is my outreach helping patients who need better medicine and can't afford dispensary concentrates at the price level so i'm just doing this real gently given that heat because i'm pressing at such a lower temperature than i normally do takes a little longer for that heat to start working its way in there [Music] but i'm hoping on paper it should be a gusher you know 30 that's that's the magic number for the gushers usually but sometimes it'll surprise you you won't get the yield that the uh numbers said you should based on what it's telling you and that again goes to my point this is a variable plant it's always changing and as a result it's kind of hard to get a handle on it sometimes and figuring out what you can and can't do there we go there we go you should be able to see that nice cool here we go drop the pressure more now this is going to disappear from your site okay these plates are very deep and the lights will not penetrate past a certain point so once it gets to that point i'm gonna move the camera back out because i'm gonna need to pay attention to what's going on with it and when i pull those plates back apart you should see something really really nice but that's what's going on in there right now and now come right back out here focus right there keep this thing up to full pressure where i want to be don't want to risk a blowout so we're going gonna really go gently on this especially with a bag that i haven't used before too it's always always something new that gives you that learning curve all right we're gonna let it sit right there and at 180 you can let it sit on the heat a little longer without degrading it at 200 you have to react quickly but you can get amazing results at 200. some strains of 200 degrees though will shatter up on you and turn into ground glass and you definitely don't want that so i dropped my temperature profile to 180 and i am getting slightly smaller yields overall but it's not as much as i anticipated so it ended up being a much more acceptable range than i was thinking and you know so now i'm pressing at 180 this year and if i have to make adjustments next year to see what maybe 190 does or 185 then i'll do that but i'm always trying to to do better each year better quality because i'm a quality over quantity guy every time i promise you that okay so i believe we are almost ready to pull these plates apart and see what she has given us as we showed her respect you know that's the thing you show this plant respect treat it with respect press it well and it gives her soul to you you know that's what it is at least for me that's how i approach it i approach it that this plant has a soul i'm bringing that soul out making better medicine so give me a moment we're about ready to open those plates so i'm going to give you a nice view of that ready to see it let's see it pretty oh yeah i don't know about you that's looking pretty to me huh you liking that because i sure am all right so let me get the camera moved down here so as you can see the goodness and stay tuned for my next video where i'm going to be pressing moxie's viper cookies which is another heavy hitter not over 30 percent but absolutely gorgeous look at how beautiful that came out you can't even believe how it smells you know what i'm saying it is just filling this room with the dankness and i did it i got a tiny little bit of a blowout right there okay so i took it right to the edge and got the most that this flower was able to provide now it's time to find out what our yield is because my my own personal scale that i like to use is i want to see a minimum and that's minimum of a half gram per ounce per eight pressed okay minimum i'd like to get a gram per eight and some strains give me that and most of them don't so let us see what our jar ways i'm gonna back this back off now you can see everything there we go okay i got my scale i'm going to tear my 17 gram jar there we go and taking my tool down see how it picks up i did not put this on the cool plate because it's about 65 degrees in the room and cooling it too fast leads to shattering results i like the way this is picking up is sticking to itself it's very stable didn't crystalize up which i believe the last time i pressed this flower was 200 degrees i do believe i had an issue with it turning into shatter on me if that's him so i'm much much happier with what i'm seeing here right now for sure let's get this stuff off here and into its jar it's your home that's where you want to be other than my lungs look at that look how pretty no it doesn't want to focus but it's got a really beautiful color just gorgeous loving it let's get this stuff up in the jar give you guys a yield well tomorrow starts the weekend if you don't have plans get some dispensary flour if you're in the pittsburgh area come see me i'll have a present sesh love doing pressing sessions right now my wife is not in the house so i am going to be able to have people over and we can hang out got a big screen tv and lots of equipment to dab on so if you're thinking hey i want to go party in a safe secure environment where can i go well you can come see me bring some dispensary flour let's have some let's make some good medicine have a nice session you know the social aspects of medicating are every bit as important as the medicine itself in my opinion so anybody who's just sitting around medicating in isolation that's not really very therapeutic but you get it you get yourself around some other like-minded people have some interesting discussions maybe watch some tv or a movie or stand-up comedian or something that is just as therapeutic to me as hang on just a moment i got a visit all right sorry about that folks let's finish gathering this pineapple express up like i said i don't press a lot of cresco flour because i've had some had some bad results from some of it and i always found them to be kind of higher priced than their quality would seem to indicate but in terms of this pineapple express yeah i'm pretty pretty happy with it all right now we got it all in the jar try to get in the jar and not on my hands so much so that is 18.73 when you take the 17 grams for the jar away that's 1.87 no no it's 1.73 my bad 1.73 that definitely falls within the acceptable range for me so thank you for joining me for this video here's a good look at some really really beautiful rosin this is from made from cresco pineapple express premium buds so thanks for joining me on this video i will be seeing you very soon because i'm going to turn right around reset up and shoot viper cookies so stay tuned folks i'm out of here", "4X-HKOj6Igk": "24 hours in a day i need 10 more [Music] [Applause] do oh",

stream up i'm gonna use my laptop for not my laptop my paddle today i gotta stop using my uh work laptop so much if you guys didn't catch it last night i had a feature on future cannabis project hopped on the stream and uh participated in a good solvent-less conversation with puff and solvent list and cam and a couple other dudes deal grows so really uh really awesome got to talk you know talk shop talk hash so if you guys haven't had a chance go hop over on the future cannabis project and check that [ __ ] out it's real dope [Music] we grow fire what's going on boss but bobby 808 wheat house okie bryson what's good terror what's everybody doing today man um yeah i do have the link for that hold on i'll get it to you right now actually it was um like super last minute i actually wasn't going to be a part of it but i got hit up at the last possible moment and uh made it over there so let's see one of you guys will probably beat me to the link but i'll pull it up anyways there we go there we go cool so yeah i mean it was uh it was interesting because there's quite a few people over there that i didn't know that already are a part of my channel and uh they were repping over there hard showing love so shout out to you guys i appreciate it and um it was interesting the crowd that that channel has there's like 300 people in the live session in the chat and um i come on screen it's like 10 o'clock 10 30 at night i'm like super [ __ ] tired looking scruffy worn out and [ __ ] and all these fools are in the chat like oh look at this [ __ ] noob this [ __ ] noob this bum he doesn't know his [ __ ] and then i started talking and everybody was like oh oh man don't judge a book by a cover this guy knows his [ __ ] he's pretty smart oh [ __ ] so that was fun hell yeah so you're watching when i press the the zipperonies huh i've pressed so much flour i'm so i can never go back to it anyways we're going to be pulling out some um some second-rate dabs today that's what i call it i'm getting to the end of this once it is literally the last the last of the runs a couple little dabs this is by far my wife's favorite it's smooth it's potent it takes one hit and she's done so i'm gonna save this and um at the end of the day i really like my potent dabs i really need that that i'm gonna take a hit of this [ __ ] and [ __ ] go mimi's them this is that for me so i'm gonna set this side and uh save this that means we've got the no one wedding crashers which is green in my opinion i've got some of this i don't even know if this is still good let me check this is the ice cream cake and then we've got this fat ass jar of the master cushed trim smelling like [ __ ] burnt purple gas and this will probably not even get put on uh put in a packaging or anything like that this is a trim run i did with ham bone and this won't go to market he'll just take his cut i'll take my cut and you guys will most uh likely see some hello fire edibles made out of this some probably some purple uh purple some grape and lime gummies made with this deep and i'll decarb this the smell is not bad at all it's got this awesome purple funky gas to it oh all right all right hold on hold on grow guaranteed analysis so we're we're looking up some me and alias hayes are trying to diagnose athena's pro-feed their grow has two percent nitrogen eight percent phosphate and twenty percent um potash three percent magnesium eight percent sulfur and 0.1 iron it's derived from mono potassium phosphate potassium nitrate potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate and iron dtpa and then that the core has 14 nitrogen as opposed to the two it has 17 calcium .015 percent boron .01 percent copper point zero four percent manganese point zero one percent molybdenum and point zero one three percent zinc derived from calcium nitrate iron edta manganese eta copper edta zinc edta boric acid and sodium liberty so he said he's going to start by dropping core by 0.6 and adding 1 ml calmag moving at 0.6 intervals for core and one ml for calmag i'm about to take clones i'm putting together some tester plans yeah that sounds good bro i remember when i talked to athena they told me that the ratios just always run the core at sixty percent of whatever you're running the grow or the blue mat but that would just be a [ __ ] blanket ec rise which is exactly what we're trying to avoid so i think that you're taking the correct approach because their ratios are [ __ ] for led grows so there definitely needs to be some changes that happen here and i think calcium is going to be a big one and i think we need to be careful that we're only supplementing the element that's missing and not a whole thing like calmag is four different things when we might just need to be supplementing calcium so we really need to make sure that we're not just throwing the [ __ ] kitchen sink at it and we're just really figuring out exactly what it is so lab results we gotta wait for oh i love talking shop with fellow grow me's that have very good scientific approaches to figuring [ __ ] out it makes things so much [ __ ] easier when you're trying to like figure out problems and you can like kind of have a coming of the minds you know what i'm saying excuse me this [ __ ] is stupid my boy just sent me a message and said hey solomon was bnv not all heroes wear capes some come through on the darkest of days delivering love even through the fires and then he this is the picture he edited together this [ __ ] this [ __ ] be posting [ __ ] it i'll repost it oh my gosh let's go

back finish that up all right so things are booming in here got the uh seedlings going hammer a hammer hammer hammer i'll have to [ __ ] relocate these little [ __ ] a little sexy [ __ ] with your thick-ass legs look at these sexy little [ __ ] with her thick-ass legs let's talk about the roots though [ __ ] air pruning baby [Music] [Music] juice bigger the roots bigger the roots the bigger the fruits yeah hers og baby i like the way you're looking but you know what i don't like these big ass fad leaves blocking all those other nodes from this beautiful light give me some of that yeah open that [ __ ] up baby on youtube [Music] it's just getting a little packed in here why would i strip off these beautiful fan leaves you might ask well i'm making room for more clones the more light i have reaching those bottom nodes the better but it is getting to be a little bit of a packed house in pr but i like it [ __ ] are stacking you want how many [ __ ] nodes are on this plant and it's not even it's not even a foot tall i mean look that's the length of from my pinky to my thumb now i got magilla gorilla hands but it ain't that damn tall it's maybe like eight to ten inches tall and it's got one two three four five six seven eight it's at its ninth node now already straight [ __ ] love in the spectrum and the temperature and humidity apparently too apparently everything about what the [ __ ] has been going on in here they like if they like it i like it in here did a nice little flush last night mixed up a fresh res they're speeding right now going in at 5.2 and 1.6 [Music] making sure we're clearing any build out of ec we don't want any buildup at all get rid of all that [ __ ] so we flushed it out made sure the ph is right where we want it right runoff was at 5.8 so we're going in at 5.2 to bring it down and we're waiting on that tissue analysis to come in you can see that's already coming in calcium deficient [Music] so we're waiting on the lab analysis to figure out what the [ __ ] is up with athena newts and their claim of nocalmag because very clearly it's needed but i want to quantify it and see with some numbers to back it up so we'll have those lab results in a couple days alien og here in the front these are really starting to um stand out now and differentiate themselves from the rest of the plants in the room that are not alien og so since i've only got five of them and i've got almost this full light here dedicated i got like half a little bit more than half the light dedicated to just these so i'm going to go ahead and you can see like this one plant it just i didn't really have any branches i kept up that were worth keeping even this little one i'll probably chop it and just keep this main branch up here so i could scoot this over a little bit you know this one here has got three branches on it four five six so i'll probably clean up the bottoms a little bit super crop the main branch over boom that's done and then same thing on the other three plants i'm just going to continue to space them out i'll move them over like this one could really move over [Music] here and spread this [ __ ] out and that way i can keep it as short as the rest of the canopy and the rest of the plants and um we'll see how it does during the stretch i might you know lose it during the stretch and it might get away from me i want to see but for right now i can just space these out right like that and now i can go back in and i can super crop this one so instead of this man branch being up it'll be down and over we'll pop the net over it and then boom we'll flip and everything should pretty much stay good if i need to i'll pinch this middle stem to slow down its growth or any any stem really that is taking off and stretching more than the others a simple little pinch will do it you could do it in veg too like right now you can see which ones are going to be taller let's come in here go about five to six inches down the primary stem and don't do a full on super crop pinch you know what i'm saying just pinch it that's it don't bend it [Music] and you know what i can feel these stems are hollow a little bit so we've got some pith autolysis going on they're definitely not creating enough carbon through photosynthesis due to this deficiency that's going on so [Music] that's the plan though go through and we're going to do that on all of the mendos in here too except for maybe like these three up here in the front or these six up here in the front they don't need to be super cropped at all but they're just barely below the net you know so the ones that are above the net like these and back and all the ones on that side they're all going to get the same treatment as you know what i just showed you here so you can see as i come down this line there's three primary branches for each plant so this will just get cool super crops push back net down on it same thing super cropped push back net down on it and then we've got all of these side branches that are going to fill in around it so you know it's hard to see that there is an issue going on unless you look at the striping on the stems and now somebody might say oh well you've got too much light intensity [ __ ] no i don't i'm only running 34 dli right now so this is just a straight up deficiency this isn't stress but we'll have this sorted out in a couple of days no more guessing no more blanket ec rises we're gonna go ahead and work off of lab results now right no need to guess you start guessing you start making the wrong moves and then you're just chasing your [ __ ] tail no sir not in this house [Music] i'm liking the uniformity of these clones though in this room i mean i haven't done any training and they're all growing exactly how i want them to pretty good yeah right here we're only at five 550. five seventy five eighty five ninety right here so 650 600 550 [Music] 550 [Music] 530 so i mean we're hitting good numbers you can maybe lower it a little bit but i'm only running 15 hours on right now [Music] we're holding our numbers i decreased the vpd to help reduce the nutrient deficiency since they were going to go even more deficient with the higher vpd [Music] so we're at 67 and 3.5 ec for water ec i mean that's good where we want to be so they're on a recipe right now i'm gonna modify that recipe so that just lowered it down to 65. [Music] hmm so we're gonna see we're gonna put a little less demand on these plants if their nutritional you know uh input is not keeping up then i'm not going to keep pushing them hard i'm just going to drive them further into deficiency [Music] so [Music] it's gonna it's gonna come out good i think man with this no topping i mean look how straight these [ __ ] tops are down this row right here i don't know if you can see it but it's just like bam bam all the way down so imagine once we hit these with the super crop drop the net down on them and i don't want to super crop them until i know that they're healthy because then i'm going to be super cropping hollow stems and that's not that's not gonna [ __ ] be nice that's gonna break branches and [ __ ] you know so [Music] definitely gonna have to [ __ ] around and figure this one out how i want to roll with it but i think just bending it over and super cropping it lightly and then securing the super crop branch to the actual met with a i call them gumby ties those really thick rubber plant ties i'll use those and secure them to the net once i drop the net down and then that way that main branch is secured to the net and you know will grow laterally while the rest of these branches are going to catch up and grow vertically and get you know into the prime canopy area [Music] whatever doesn't keep up gotta go gotta go you know what i'm saying and then this is a little bit different for me normally i fill the canopy in way more i get way bushier and then i flip and then i cut them back midway through flour but this girl i'm gonna go into it a little bit um less beefy i'm gonna have just the top couple nodes on each branch that i decide to keep and i'm gonna try to not overstuff the canopy and see how it goes real quick 78.2 78 77 [Music] curious i am serious ever so curious so my lights are set to dim if it gets past 88 degrees in here so i set the temperature to 84 i think right now or 85. we're gonna up the temperature in here a little bit and get our leaf surface temp back up into like the 80. i like to see it at 79.80 78 on the lower end it needs to be warmer in there and i can't be leaving leaves everywhere hold on take another babaroni here and go grab some lunch in a minute i still haven't eaten [Music] today i forgot the strobes here [Music] velcro tape works well for tying down yeah that's a good one too only thing i would be concerned with velcro's it's not going to let go of the plant too easy i guess it could depending on how well you velcro it but those plant ties i don't even really put them on there too hard i just barely twist it and the plant just takes off does its own thing burst out of it when it's ready all right let's go with this wedding crashers i mean [ __ ] it let's just give it another chance it's just it smells good and then you dab it and it tastes green so that part's kind of annoying i don't don't care for that but you know what let's um let's not enjoy the flavor on this and let's just enjoy the high i'm going to up my temp to 445 get this dabbed off a little bit quicker may not be greedy because i still need to run hash before i have more i've got some wedding crashers i would like to run probably going to do it tonight and uh [Music] [Music] um oh yeah i was waiting for the email to get up to temperature and then what the [ __ ] else was i doing totally oh yeah almost forgot completely i wish kraft farmer would not be so extra maybe that's not extra maybe that's just him but it's just god damn it it's always so extra i don't learn anything from his pages maybe i would have a year or two ago but i don't learn anything now from his page except how to be an arrogant [ __ ] it's not a good thing not something i want to emulate try and skip through those as quickly as possible usually coffee time dude i wish it was coffee time i'm just waiting on oh we're at temperature let's go mix it with runs no why would i disgrace the runts like that yo alone that's that's sketch would you wait you feel the same way about puff and salt unless what do you mean what am i missing here did i miss something part of the chat damn i missed something oh well cheers i don't remember this is not a flavorful dab there's a get high dab okay [Music] oh gotcha i mean [Music] i'll give credit where credit is due when i met puffin he was doing something i hadn't been doing yet which was the higher temperature hash presses 225 224 and um so i had talked to him just talking shop and we exchanged some tech and this tech was pretty good you know and um it doesn't work for everything and everybody's press is different right but um he's pretty knowledgeable as far as processing goes i can't say much about his growing because personally i haven't seen it but i did smoke some of his single source gmo and i don't like gmo but i enjoyed that it had a different sweetness to it it wasn't like straight disgusting funk and um as a processor i give him props for going to people's grows and harvesting it himself to make sure that it's done properly and to his liking not a lot of hashers are doing that they just expect the grower to know exactly how to handle it when the grower more often than not has never been a processor and they have a completely different process for handling it you know to turn it into sellable nugs so it's like you can't expect the grower to be able to nail prepping for your process every time and get it right so for him to go there and do it i mean that's major props in my book let me see what's up chester nope don't like gmo tastes like garlic butter shrimp farts smoked out of a [ __ ] empty gas can not enjoyable anyways you guys i hope you enjoyed the stream i am gonna go grab some food wifey and um i'll probably be back actually i'm not gonna be able to wash tonight because i still need to fill up the rest with ice and then let my ice machine make more ice so probably going to be washing tomorrow early tomorrow morning maybe and we'll get everything prepped tonight jim socks on the xbox all right you guys be easy and i'll catch you later", "8hp58_uVKCo": "[Music] so i'll turn this off now that i'm going live [ __ ] that feels good good morning youtube welcome to another beautiful day in the neighborhood mr rogers neighborhood would you could you be my neighbor it's time to harvest today so we're gonna get started with some dabs ricky winky dabs and bakey gotta wait for the uh hydro store to open so i can head over there and get some more plastic trellis so i can hang all the nugs from the plastic trellis so they don't open for another 45 minutes got some time to kill and we're going to start today off with some chopped cookies and this is going to probably be the last of that scraping the jar [Music] well that's all we got left in there smack her down shout out to my man merlin melts doing his thing out there oh i think i got his instagram i could show you guys that is really good work really good work anyways cheers monday morning nabaronis and you know what people are always asking me about these turt balls so i'll go ahead [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] there you go [Music] fire always fire [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] ah [Music] [ __ ] is leaning same thing over here just leaning had one plant dry back a little too much over the last two days but the other ones were right on the money so we'll start harvesting that soon here [Music] ah what's up chat just tuning into the chat right now bunt joe saw chris mystic bunt and stinky in the house what's good dab what's up og everybody in the house yeah man it's gonna be a nice chop i'm gonna um probably go ahead and throw on the edge strap so i can take you guys pov into the grow room and start the chop [Music] oh my god [Music] i've had like this [ __ ] pulled muscle in my chest shoulder and my lats it's just like anytime i move this shoulder or arm it just instantly tenses up hey baby classy thank you [Music] damn dab you got four and a four by four two hermes one lit blue male one pregnant i'll chop [Music] what's up just about [Music] do you're highly disappointed in the rent cuts that you're running why what's going on [Music] with your cuts [Music] [Music] so [Music] i'm just checking work [ __ ] looking at the chat all types of [ __ ] [Music] you got that boost cut [Music] i can't even tell you what the final smell is they don't have their final smell yet when i run the hash i'll let you know what the final smell is [Music] right now it smells like plants oh man if i get my back to pop right now it's so fantastic oh there it goes a little bit [Music] oh man [Music] yeah i was going to order some mango tech sleeves to protect my arms while i'm digging through the the plants and all that [ __ ] but i didn't do it in time so i'm gonna just have to put on like a long sleeve shirt i have uh some long sleeve shirts that i could wear for like chopping down that i didn't want to wear them i just wanted to wear my sleeves what's up ready to hit hot fire how do you do that how do you tag people when you talk in chat i don't even know that oh you gotta do it on the computer if you don't have smell you might need to check um you might need to check your your environment it might be too hot in your room it might be too cold in your room [Music] nah it's not lung related it's a muscle i can feel it like when i raise my arm and i have my hand right here i can feel the the pectoralis muscle like rubber band past my hand which means it's just really tight and that connects all right in here and the laps right here it's not like deep inside my rib cage it's the actual lats like i could grab it and feel it [Music] hmm oh here we go here's a good stretch i'm gonna hold this for a second i gotta just be patient with [Music] the morning stretches i do are so critical for my back i just got done doing some but [Music] the moment you [ __ ] sit back down it like undoes all the [ __ ] that you undo [Music] all right let's go 81 degrees with 50 to 60 humidity damn your humidity's too low bring your humidity up at 81 degrees your humidity should probably be of around 65-70 which means that you might be causing some issues with them transpiring too much you know what i mean oh these are good by the way these are called hempias they're delicious six grams of omega three and six is gluten free vegan and soy free soy free is the key that is the [ __ ] key [Music] [Music] and now let's whatever's in this jar we're going for this next la kushfit [Music] i don't know how i sleep with my arms because i'm asleep [Music] 84 and 45 holy [ __ ] ready you need to up your humidity too bro your humidity is [ __ ] way too low bro you're stressing those plants though [ __ ] out [Music] you guys need to follow vpd charts [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] hmm if it's wet in your tent just from going to 70 humidity that means you don't have enough airflow in your tent you need more airflow higher humidity more airflow [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] there's different vpd charts too you guys should be aware of [Music] make sure that the vpd chart that you look at it's an accurate one for your room that shows the calculation based on the difference between your ambient air temp and your leaf surface tip because like if you're looking at a dpd chart that shows a two degree difference between ambient and leaf and then you look at one that shows a four degree difference between ambient and leaf the the difference in where your vpd curve is at is pretty significantly different um so it's one thing to keep in mind you know always use vpd man you can't go wrong i got about 25 minutes until the [ __ ] hydro store opens up i wish i could start cutting them down but i just i need more neck first and this is going to be a long process a long process i'm trying to think how much net i need i need at least six eight foot sections so i'm gonna get a 50 foot [Music] 50 foot net four four foot by fifty foot if they have that size it might be five by fifty but i'll get one of those six inch squares [Music] one per light i should easily be able to uh hang all that i think like because i've done this so many times by myself i have a methodology that kind of works well but this is my first time doing oh a room this size sorry i can't stop stretching i'm just trying to stay loose or actually loosen up i'm so tight right now yeah it's gonna be a lot of work try to go look in there again it's okay i have way more of this rod way more i think i think i probably have in there it's hard to tell because everything's so folded over now but probably anywhere between [Music] low end eight pounds absolute minimum high end maybe 12 13 [Music] i don't know it's hard to say because i've never ran this configuration before so it's hard for me to eyeball it but it's somewhere between 8 to 12. i i know four pounds is like a big range but i'm not really sure what's going on with the weight of the strain either and the lowers and all that i don't know it's hard we'll see i'm going to um hopefully get it all hung today [Music] and uh the plan is as i go through to remove any um dead leaves anything that's you know already yellowed off completely anything with burnt tips really close to the nugs it's gonna get snipped now so that as it dries those don't pull into the nub and then basically i'm going to leave all of the sugar leaf all of the healthy fan leaves and leave it all on the plants and i'll hang it up that way and then after the um first probably three four days of drying i'll come back in and i'll take all the large fan leaves and trim all of those off just let them fall to the floor and then clean up the floor after i'm done um and then from there i leave everything on and everything gets washed after that so i just let it continue to dry once the nugs are almost snapping off they're pretty much ready you could freeze them at that point but personally i like i like and what i found work best when working with nug run is to allow it to actually dry out more um you know if you let it get almost too dry right just where it barely starts to get too dry that first you know half a day where you're like oh [ __ ] is it time yet is the time yet and you keep checking on it and you know some are snapping some aren't if you give it just a little bit more time to where almost your big buds are snapping and then just take it straight off the branches you don't have to trim it nothing i just grab the whole branch buck the whole thing straight into a bag throw the branch away and then you put everything in the bag that way it's brittle and your trichomes still haven't you know dried out like that and it makes breaking down the bud when you go to wash it ten times easier you end up getting way more yield because especially if you have real dense nugs it's easier to break apart if it's dried out fully i mean fully dried if you still have any moisture inside that bud inside the plant matter it's not going to want to break apart and if it doesn't break apart you can't access those trichomes inside so typically what you want to do if you know you're going to wash it is go ahead and let it dry out and you do a quick dry not a very long dry but not too quick because then you ruin the bud right so usually about six to eight days is where i target um around 65 to 70 degrees in the room and around 40 humidity the first day and then after that i go up to about uh 60 or maybe 55 and uh just let it cruise and check on it often make sure there's a little bit of airflow in the room and then yeah usually by day seven everything's ready to start coming down the progression between day five and seven is very rapid so you have to be ready for it and um yeah you don't have to cure it you don't have to burp it none of that [ __ ] you dry it just the right amount get rid of that green hay smell buck into the bags get as much air out as you can tie it up real good and put it into a chest freezer it'll freeze real quick you'll preserve all your terps you know it doesn't oxidize all crazy you know it works really well that saves me a lot of time on the trimming and honestly the most intensive part right now is uh just gonna be cutting them down without actually knocking everything over because i try to be real gentle you know but right now with how the nets are [ __ ] leaning so much i might have a hard time plucking [ __ ] out and cutting it you know out of there i might i gotta figure out what the [ __ ] i'm gonna do but either way that shit's gonna get knocked out i might call into work for the rest of the day i don't feel like being on call today i don't have any appointments on my schedule though what the [ __ ] are we off today why don't i have anything going on today i mean it's tomorrow [Music] but not do that all right never mind i don't have to call out there [Music] usually if i have like a [ __ ] ton of work i have to do i'll just call out i don't have time for [ __ ] [Music] why do i freeze the bud um i freeze it because that's how you extract the trichomes when you make bubble hash you freeze the bud first makes the trichomes brittle and fall off easily it makes the bud break apart more easily so you can extract those trichomes from the inner parts of the bud and it makes it so that the chlorophyll doesn't leach out into your end product oh this is the bill cosby the great crosby rip cosby [Music] i'm high already [Music] i gotta order a new chest freezer today i'm gonna go ahead and get a 20 cubic foot chest freezer the one i have out there right now is a seven so yeah it's just time to big boy up right i need room to place all of these [ __ ] packs and i am not going to fit [ __ ] i'm going to assume it's going to be like 10 to 15 big ass turkey bags in there it's just not gonna happen so i gotta order that and i've gotta order my um my ice machine today [ __ ] me i was looking at uh the manitowoc ice machines and they're pretty expensive but stop telling me what to do [ __ ] i can't go pov and get going i have to go get the nets first so that i can hang bro yeah see once you're back you're excited huh you're more excited than i am for this chop i think yeah but i gotta get the big freezer um and then the the freeze drop not the free dryer the uh ice machine because i'm [ __ ] tired i'm not going to target don't worry you guys i might go one time before if i have to go before i get the ice machine but i mean i'm going through like 200 [ __ ] pounds of ice at a time and this is not you know what i can get today i can get the larger reservoir for the ro container back here and get rid of this 59 gallon drum because that's not enough water so i think i'm gonna upgrade that to a 200 gallon wide body open top like the same height almost which makes it easy for me to load the ice in check the levels you know insulation will be nice on it where's my tape measure [Music] stretch my ice guy loves me you mean [Music] target i gotta make real quick all right so that's a 29 inch door and i'm gonna look online real quick but i think that the um 200 gallon res [Music] is 28 inches let me see see if i can find it online real quick i know they got at the hydro store but there's so many [ __ ] different reservoirs here uh the container 200 gallon open top excuse me open top flat bottom 200 gallons it is technical drawing shows that [Music] it's 50 and a half inches tall [ __ ] me it's 45 and a half 5 8 inches wide so i can't fit that one because i here's a [ __ ] issue i can't even go into the hydro store right now and shop around and measure anything i have to [ __ ] place the order um on the phone with them or like walk up and try and tell them what i want they open in 10 minutes so maybe i'll just [ __ ] head over there and like [Music] now i'm just going to call them first let's see because i don't want to waste my time going over there i want them to have my order ready so that by the time i get there i can just pull up and throw that [ __ ] in the truck otherwise i get there and [ __ ] takes forever man [Music] oh here we go here's the one i wanted 36 inches long 36 inches all right so that's a 36 so that's not gonna work the 200 gallons [Music] [ __ ] well i guess i'm not going to be able to put the 200 down [Music] want to see i can't keep washing with this 50 gallon because when i do i end up having to um top it off with an extra like 15 to 20 top off water or ice you know i should just be able to add all the ice i need all the water i need have the right ratio it melts down gives me the perfect amount of really cold you know 38 to 42 degree water that's the goal i don't know we'll see [Music] it's hard to find something that [ __ ] fits because everything's like 36 inches and my door is 29 inches i've seen those on like square tanks that fit up against the wall and one of those might be practical but i don't know where the [ __ ] to find them or what they're called i've looked for them before bro stop filling up five gallon jugs [ __ ] that noise uh just like i could [ __ ] stretch out these lower verbs can't i get it in the room sideways then put it up no man it's a [ __ ] circle the bottom is hard plastic circle it's 36 inch diameter and my door is only 29 inches there's there's no way to [ __ ] finagle that into the doorway [Music] let's go with some of this cookie dough yeah i'm not using a collapsible [Music] reservoir um actually you know something i need to take care of in here pretty soon is i need to re-run some electrical and i'm going to switch this sides where i'm going to take this vent rack and move it over here because i've got the extra two layers coming so i'm gonna go ahead and um move my workbench behind me and maybe downsize to a shorter workbench and uh put the the veg track over here and uh then i'll be able to fit a bigger washer or a second washer in here [Music] hmm grab some water first [Music] it's all dry i'm not dehydrated i haven't [ __ ] really drank any water just [ __ ] woke up drinking coffee and dabbing [Music] wow the focus on this gopro is trash anyways cheers happy monday get some damn work done today don't be lazy uh [Music] [Music] she [Music] melissa i haven't i haven't shoot me your information again please because i remember you sent it to me and i have no idea where i went i don't know where you sent it to me at or how long ago and don't tell me publicly but send me your shirt size too because i still have a bunch of the uh shirts from the vendor that [ __ ] up so i need to get rid of them or send me a shirt or two okay i got you it's on patreon i got you ah they changed the look of patreon a little bit [Music] [Music] [Music] you got it nah but i'm only sending the people i haven't sent them to yet i owe some people some care packages still all right i got i got you shout out to all my patreon members yeah i'll shoot you an empty jar see if it makes it through customs first [Music] so all right 9.57 i'm going to go ahead and uh give the hydro store a call here in a minute okay what i need ordered and then uh go pick it up so i can start this harvest i have gloves i have a mask i have scissors i have alcohol i need the nets i have zip ties i can't think of anything else i would need it's been a minute but i think that's all i need [Music] yeah the rosin is going to be [ __ ] amazing from this run honestly it's gonna be good it's gonna be good oh i can't grab too many ipas they make me sick well just alcohol in general my body is uh slowly but surely starting to reject it so even after just like three or four ipas i get nauseous very fatigued it's like very sick before i even get drunk and i just get sick hey the package fantastic it's 9 59. let's go ahead and give them a call [Music] [ __ ] [Music] i better not be allergic [Music] hey what's going on man uh this is uh anthony i needed to place an order with you guys [Music] okay sir who's this mark nate what's going on me uh fun man's chop day we've got a busy day oh yeah you're tired you're tired um do you guys have the six inch square plastic trellis i need like um a 50 foot probably no don't tell me that okay can you hold that four and a half by 100 for me and i'll come scoop that right now i appreciate you [Music] um what uh reservoirs do you guys have there right now like the 100 gallon and up like maybe 100 200 gallons [Music] okay [Music] yeah uh is he in today all right cool i'll see you thanks dude [Music] all right so they've got a four and a half foot by 100 which i'm gonna go scoop that [ __ ] because they either had that or six and a half by 100 and i don't want that that's too long that's they're too wide you know so i'm gonna go scoop that um see if they have the reservoir but i'm really tripping on that today and then i'm gonna come back and get cracking i'll probably grab an extra pair two of scissors and uh yeah [Music] i'll uh try to make a notification on youtube and instagram and patreon maybe um before i start the live session but uh yeah it'll probably be in the next hour or two so stay tuned get ready hit the [ __ ] bell make sure you guys have notifications on [Music] we're gonna start this chat from start to finish i'll try and stream as much as i can and which is probably not going to be that pretty when i first get started until i get into a groove all right so bruce", "DsURHS8wMmg": "yo yo what's good you guys welcome to another live stream just getting ready to take some dabs and i wanted to hang out for a bit about 30 40 minutes and uh to shoot [ __ ] with you guys kind of fill you in on where we're at with the grow room and uh not too much change since yesterday just took care of the few small things i said i was going to got the irrigation leak welded up that's curing right now and i also started sanitizing the entire irrigation system including the reservoirs so with that said all i've got to do now is sit back relax and wait flush the system and then sanitize it again using the second chemical which is senate so we'll get into that let's take a dab on this mindo breath trim in dry sift rosin i'm sure this camera's not falling all over the place today [Music] [ __ ] this year we have a good little tradition of staying home with the kids and just being safe and being silly [Music] what's up fpv ocean elite hemp warren this uh mendo breath is finally starting to cure up in here a little bit let's [ __ ] pull it why not [Applause] [Music] you're doing big dabs oh [Music] 2021 you're leaving those baby [ __ ] dabs behind and you're [ __ ] with the big boy dabs only that's your new year's resolution you're [Music] welcome [Music] wow hmm [Music] [Music] whew [Music] [Music] 4 30 on 10. [Music] what's up gekko [Music] got guy on [Music] [Music] got my turf cave going [Music] i'd show you guys the room but there's nothing to see and you guys will lag out [Music] damn fire tilt this up a little bit i see there we go all right how many of you guys are staying in and how many of you guys are going out i stopped going out for new year's a long time ago man this is not worth the half there's so much of a hassle and then to do anything big they actually like [ __ ] rape you on prices for everything it's not worth it gotta deal with all these drunk [ __ ] if i ever do anything for new year's it's gonna be like i'm gonna host something you know what i'm saying i'm gonna host something at my own spot i'm not against alcohol by any means but there's just too many people out there that don't know how to handle their [ __ ] staying as usual session in yeah all you guys are staying in huh that's why you're like that's why we're here [ __ ] [ __ ] of course we're not going out that's funny it's just another year man it's just another year [Music] you guys think there's anything special about the new year do you feel like do you feel like there's anything cosmically significant or do you feel like we just made that number right i don't know i just don't i don't know i don't really feel like the new year really means [ __ ] every year they try and say it's something else that's gonna kill everybody y2k mine calendar ending coronavirus [ __ ] there's always something man every year there's always some crisis it's like a [ __ ] a bad superhero tv show every episode there's another [ __ ] crisis that needs to be fixed but the season keeps on going season after season after season until it doesn't that's scary huh i just i don't know dude there's like man this is getting into like if you guys remember um we used to do conspiracy one day it was like monday night live session we would dedicate to just random conspiracy theory we're talking about [ __ ] like controversial right so one of the things that i personally find interesting to think about is have we been to space how much do we actually know about space how much of history has been faked and lies versus how much is actually true because there's a whole lot of things that affect us and there's a whole lot of things that don't affect us when it comes to you know what we've been told right as far as history is concerned and things like that but personally personally i feel like the cosmos is something that despite the fact that many of us may never really have anything to do with it in our lifetime it could answer a lot of questions about our origin um you know the whole power thing you know a whole lot of answers you know but it's something good to think about it's um do you believe it there's a lot of people that have broken down the math and i'm i can't understand at all but they've broken down the math and supposedly we don't even have the necessary physical capabilities to break through the atmosphere and get into orbit and into outer space you know a lot of the footage that you see always looks cgi you never see any like what looks like real footage and you know you go back and you look at the initial moonland all that and oh man i just i'm sorry i just i can't look at that and take it seriously now it's like watching an old twilight episode like when the monster [ __ ] flies down from the sky and lands on the airplane wing but you could tell he's in a harness like it's so obvious that's kind of how those look you know what i'm saying just super just weird and funky i don't know but what what proof do you guys have look i've worked in the air force for seven [ __ ] years active duty four of those years were at a special operation space the last two and a half of those years were at vandenberg air force base where they actually launched a lot of the rockets now obviously these aren't a lot of demand crafts but i mean i went and saw multiple launches and in person i've walked through the the [ __ ] cement foundations and tunnels where all the flames and fire smoke comes out of you know so i mean i know we're launching rockets i'm not stupid but do i believe that we're landing on the moon and that we have in the past and all that or is everybody just [ __ ] lying who knows all the visualizations that we see are all cgi'd about all the planets you don't see any like real photographs or videos at least i don't i'm not saying that space is fake you guys holy [ __ ] if you guys take what i'm saying right now and twist it into i'm saying that space is fake and all of that you're sadly mistaken that's not what the [ __ ] i'm saying what i'm saying is the amount that they exaggerate seems it seems very likely that they're exaggerating a lot of capabilities and what we have and have not done because how else would they continue to get the budget for it if they don't have anything to show for it right like a couple years ago there was a big controversy about the rockets that are able to come back down and land rocket thruster side down and it's so irrational and against logic but who knows who knows like i'm not smart enough to do all the math to confirm whether or not all that is true are any of you guys because unless any of you guys are actual [ __ ] rocket scientist physicist [ __ ] meteorologist and you can break down the map don't even come at me don't even [ __ ] come at me because my guess is just as good as yours so all of that uh fake space [ __ ] blah blah you don't [ __ ] know are you a [ __ ] astronaut no [ __ ] because you would not be watching my youtube right now so don't nobody in here no anybody any better than the next person that's why i said let's have a conversation about it like what do you guys think but don't attack people for what they think because nobody knows space force yeah discover less than two percent of the deep ocean right exactly am i suspicious of religion as i am with the moon landing how would you even how was that even after tapas comparison i don't understand that i won't even touch on religion tonight we don't have enough time for that stinger why am i whack as [ __ ] why are you so mad bro do you want to take a dab with me will that make you feel better here everybody let's take a dab for stinger because he's really upset and so we should take a dab for him now so he could feel better all right so stinger this one's for you cheers buddy no it's just a adult i don't need to get panties in a bunch man let's take a dab show those panties out so need to be so angry bro it's all good man it's all love here nobody's trying to come out nobody here what's up rosie [ __ ] that dab tool and a little bit of rosin it still had on it i don't want to hit it at 5 50. i don't know why you guys or i'm not saying you guys i don't know why you keep telling me what attempt to hit it at this is my first rodeo brother this is the temp that i like from my setup maybe on your setup you need 550 on my setup it's a deep dish in this deep ass coil 430 is on the money even lower for some [ __ ] [Music] what oh man i don't even run a perpetual harvest right now i wish my shit's a little slow right now because i keep you know upgrading and fixing and doing minor [ __ ] here and there yeah man what man this mendo [ __ ] smacks taking it to 63 64 days was [ __ ] perfect initially i was planning on pulling it around day 60 uh you know 58 to 60 but every time i scope the trikes i was just like ah a little bit more a little bit more a little bit more i feel like i got a good uh a good level of cloudy and amber not really here at all not be a stable environment if i'm going to have a separate veg area it has to be just as dedicated as the flower room otherwise it's kind of pointless 450 works on some strains but i mean here's the thing when you guys are talking about temps you have to understand that there's so many variables that go into deciding what's a good temperature for whatever you're smoking the number one thing being what are you smoking hash rosin flower rosin vho how was it filtered how well was it filtered what size your rig is if you're using a drop down or not [ __ ] and the other big thing is the coil like the higher i really don't need the higher temp i really don't you guys don't understand i'm not dropping like a 0.1 gram dab i'm hitting my point threes it's gonna take me more than a couple of hits and i prefer it that way i'm not trying to scorch my dab to get it all in one hit i prefer to taste it and then yeah and then the strain big big difference like that peyote og that [ __ ] like to be here uh the peyote wi-fi that should like to be hit lower temperature that gelato g i was able to hit that [ __ ] higher at like 430 440 but the peyote 415 420 was money is hash rosin better than flower rosin it's a personal preference thing man it's like saying her fat girl is better than skinny girls or are skinny girls better than fat girls [ __ ] man whatever you like you like try them both and decide for yourself flower rosin can be really really really clean it's not going to be as clean as equally well processed hash rosin but it's going to be very very comparable to some lowering hash rosin and it's not going to chas your banger up like a lot of people will say but i press all my flower through 25 micron so there's that it's 20 20 about to be 20 21 and people are still pressing flower rosin in 90 and 120 micron bags that [ __ ] blows my mind if y'all don't knock that [ __ ] out that [ __ ] it blows my mind that girl's flower positive yeah i don't know we're not gonna get to that one i don't want her nobody's feelers i just uploaded a video like 25 minutes ago right before i started this stream to show the whole sanitation process of the lines and everything so check it out it's like part four of the reset um and there's probably gonna be one last video and it's just gonna be a summary video which is going to recap everything that i did in a short and sweet five minutes or less video um i'll put some text up on the screen some links in the description um all that good stuff and you know hopefully i'll what i'll do is i'll put it in a playlist and i'll just save it as grow room reset and then you guys can reference it whenever you want and it goes over the entire thing from a to z um resetting the room so this was by far the most extensive and most thorough reset that i've done ever and i decided to get all the right tools and not go cheap and it made it [ __ ] 10 times easier the mini um split bib kit worked a charm in here the first time i did it in there you know because it was easier to access and i wanted to make a mess in there if i was going to make one once i got it in here i got it going perfect didn't make a single mess and that helped a lot i got the foam sprayer from biosafe that helped a [ __ ] ton um feels so good to sanitize the whole room and know that i had you know full contact time with everything so many good things so many good things thoughts on jungle boys they're jungle boys ask me a better question i hate that that's like what you got to give me some [ __ ] context with your questions and give me some [ __ ] meat and potatoes i'm not just gonna start talking about jungle booms i go with rosin ink bags i've got a yeah there you go ocean posted it i've got a discount code on my promo page that you guys can use save you a little bit of money oh [ __ ] i gotta set up v-a-t for all of my european folks somebody purchased something on the site i think it was bunt maybe gotta check but i appreciate all you guys overseas that try and support thoughts on not using humidifiers with led what what does your light have to do with anything just run the proper humidity for your room at all times that's dumb why grow if you're not even gonna have a humidifier you might as well stop growing ambrosia crops and i've already looked at them i'm probably not gonna [ __ ] with them we'll see [Music] i'm not going to talk too much about the crop steering on the videos anymore i'm over it um i've repeated it a million times i have classes that i offer now 250 bucks a person it's intro to crop steering and i posted it on instagram earlier but instagram is shadow banning me so none of my shit's showing up anywhere people have to like search for me right now but um i put together a little class for helping people with um that's what's not in here right now for helping people out with crop steering because a lot of people keep hearing crops during crop steering and the people that they are seeing it from don't necessarily have a good grasp on it themselves and so um i decided i'm going to start up my classes again and just start uh teaching people myself so they can hear it straight from the horse's mouth rather than somebody else who's trying to repeat it but doesn't understand it fully so i'm gonna a it's gonna be an introduction to crop steering and b is going to be an introduction to how to utilize the taros 12 and pro check to strategize your crop steering management so it's going to be those two things and it's gonna be about 90 minutes um with a q a at the end so that everybody has time and i'm limiting the class to five people at a time just so that if anybody has questions i can answer their questions anybody that already purchased or is going to purchase a pro check and tarot's 12 combo gets the class for free all they got to do is just show me their proof of purchase and schedule their date with me and they're good to go um but that's the way i'm going to do it from now on because the amount of information that i give out during one of these classes is worth probably like 10 grams i [ __ ] you not so i'm just gonna go ahead and start doing that and if people are serious about their craft and improving their their crop then if they need the information and they don't want to learn it on their own and go through trial and error then they can pay for my class otherwise you know all the information that i learned from crop steering is mostly out there on the internet and the other 10 20 it's just game through experience i get a lot of [ __ ] haters and trolls to be like oh you're just a scammer you just want to charge people for free information well if that information is so [ __ ] readily accessible why are you on my channel go to another [ __ ] channel then that's sharing the information there's a reason you're here you know what i'm saying and that [ __ ] isn't free people expect that [ __ ] to be like searched for them researched completely for them parsed summarized and then put on a silver platter for them because information is free sure but it takes time and effort to acquire the correct information it takes time to understand that information and put it into practice so that you can truly grasp it so when you're paying somebody who's more experienced than you for a lesson that's what you're paying for you're paying for a shortcut so that you don't have to take the time the effort the l's during the r d and you can just kind of want to skip a few 99 100. so for the trolls out there that don't understand that concept and you think oh information is free you're right go spend the next couple years researching it and putting it together for yourself then and then you can go ahead and put together free classes for everybody and teach them until then put your money where your mouth is or [ __ ] get your ass on google and do some research i just felt like i had to address that i get a lot of people that put dumb ass comments because they feel some type of way so that [ __ ] blows my mind a dome for my clones those clones in there aren't droopy because they don't have a dome the humidity in the room is at 85 they're droopy because they were in an arrow cloner for like four weeks before they got sent to me they had 20 inch long roots and when you go from an arrow cloner with 20 inch long roots to rockwool cube they're going to be stressed the [ __ ] out and probably come near death for about three to four days before they start rooting in and absorbing the water from the cube otherwise you just have a little root ball sitting there that's drying out and you have wilted ass clones so there's nothing i can do about that all right for everybody that's asking what is crop steering does it apply to this here's what crop steering is real quick and simple because i'm going to go hang with my wife now crop steering is the practice of collecting the appropriate data and analyzing it so that you can see the plant's cues when it wants certain things the plant will cue it to you if you're collecting the right data and then you can adjust your irrigation strategy as well as your environment to cause the plant to have a certain type of growth either vegetative or generative vegetative obviously is going to be more pushing out leafing right generative is going to be your initial stretch and then growing nugs and certain strategies that you provide are going to cause the plants to grow better at certain times and you can significantly increase your overall yield and quality of the buds by knowing what to look for knowing the fundamentals of prop steering and understanding what what to do to achieve the results you want you're going to fail miserably with crop steering if you come into it with the mindset that 90 of the people do what's the proper dryback numbers for rockwool what's the proper dryback for flour what's the there's no formula there's no numbers right it's like somebody asking you what's the best way to raise your kids well [ __ ] that's a loaded question right you have to know how to look for cues you have to look to know when they're hungry you have to look to know when they're sleepy you have to look them when they're being overfed when they're thirsty you have to look for the cues and then make informed decisions there's no one answer there's no one numerical value that fits it for everybody everybody's room is different everybody's environment's different everybody's cultivars are different everybody's growing experience is different so all of these things are going to play into it so if you don't understand the fundamentals of crop steering you're never going to be able to make a decision on your own you're constantly going to be going to somebody else asking them about what to do well this is my numbers what do i do this is what my graph looks like it looks like yours am i doing it right no [ __ ] no that's not what it's about you have to understand the fundamentals and then you'll know what the [ __ ] you're doing even if you're not even if you don't have the best control over it you'll know what you're doing you're not gonna have to just chase your tail i feel like there's so many people that are so quick to be like i want the data i want the information i want the sensor but then they don't know what the [ __ ] to do with it they just got it because they saw that lost we've got it or elias had it or i have it but they don't take the time to understand the lessons i've been teaching for the past two three months showing the sensor off it took me months to understand how to use it you know what i'm saying before i felt comfortable showing it to you guys and i had to get through two grows before i felt comfortable explaining prop steering to you guys and the strategies that you use with that specific tool you know without having 24 7 logging right there's so many different little things that you won't know about if you just grab this tool and try to use it and i've already got three people in my dm bro i got it today but i have no [ __ ] clue what i'm doing help yeah man you're gonna need a little huddle you know but yeah there's there's a lot to it and people that don't understand the foundation are just constantly going to be tripping over their own toes so that's why i put together this class i'm keeping it small intimate people can ask questions it's going to be structured there'll be a you know probably a powerpoint but at the same time i like to just kind of go with the flow of things and just have a general guideline and people are going to be welcome to take notes um there will be some information um that will be provided in a downloadable format but uh for the most part it's just going to be the basic fundamentals and that way the person can always refresh themselves okay what am i looking for again to know that it's time to do this oh that's right this means this i can go ahead and do this now but you still have to look for the cue [Music] that's what it is i hope that makes sense for you guys [Music] [Music] i hope the clones make it too but if they don't i have a plan b uh these won't be hermes these are for sure these have been ran already a couple times um i have a backup plan the backup plan is you know all the frost factory g6 hers og all of that well hambone has those in solo cups right now you just topped them and he's going to be transplanting them but he said he's going to check on monday to see how many clones he can pull from each one and either i'll run those or if he has something on deck i may run something that he has like probably not the mendo again but maybe like the alien og or something else we'll see so look the class is 250 bucks a person it's gonna be via webinar okay five people per class so that way there's time for everybody to get their questions in at the end and have them answered knowing me they're probably going to go over 90 minutes if it does it does if people are good with the info and don't need the extra time and that's even better but if they need it i'm there probably for an extra 30 minutes um and like i said it'll have a little downloadable content not a whole lot so yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] um sorry i just spaced out i'm looking for something right now somebody just asked me for a video and i do this is gonna get uploaded to youtube right now people keep asking me for this too video of my irrigation so i did this the other day i forgot about it bam upload it sbnb irrigation explained grow room irrigation explained upload not for kids all right cool all right cool all right you guys i'm gonna get the [ __ ] up out of here i know i said that like three or four times now but i'm actually gonna get out of here thanks for hanging out taking some dabs and um we'll catch up tomorrow happy new year everybody um hit me up on um email or instagram however you want you can go through my website and contact me um all types of stuff so different ways to get a hold of me and uh we'll get you guys scheduled and what i'm gonna do is the first five people that hit me up and pay i'm gonna put them all in a group chat or group email and coordinate the best time slot for everybody and then we'll get it on the calendar that way everybody has time to make sure that that time slot is open for them and then we'll proceed with the class um now i would go ahead and record it for people but i feel like each class is going to be a little different with the questions that are asked so um i'll have to see about that especially with the zoom recordings right now it's like super limited ow storage space is gonna hurt i got pvc glue on my [ __ ] arm hair so put that in my pocket and save it for later so yeah that's the way that's going to go down so good hold me email website instagram all right have a good night you guys be safe catch you guys later", "EM3RNNvtA80": "what is up world chris dodd's it's 4:20 here the YouTube channel for weed lovers in Kansas patients alike so today

make sense but all I know is its earthly things but it's mine mainly by me scoffs I just thought you first change you breathe it out then you kinda feel the pungent earthy but it's first like very funny I could I just don't wind up sometimes I caused so much a confidence get sick with my coffee I don't like doing that this morning so one who I'm cuz it's a person is available even options for half hour right I gotta I've got just bike to the drugstore come on bust my hair got ready did the video did my head if I do another one maybe I'll just wait a sec I got another very cool long but I'm gonna do a STONER shout out or something I got an ad product review okay they're gonna Scott Brad Scott crap what's your my favorite bawling like that no more like they're my favorite skunk rat

by giving dabs oh my dad those are my gotta be stamping on morning because I'm on a video or cool so I put like a high standard and then we get in at 10:00 at I know we're all just in case some that my door needs to stay anyways peace out remember you are crisp that says stay medicated [Music]", "uiiyBZxyutg": "what's up homie murder bombs small tubes been a minute [Music] we here at the lab you know um yes that well like you can see it there's little circulator running that's recovering a run from the closed loop system but for right now we bounce in a little bit of dry [ __ ] just real quick nothing's nothing special just doing some quick bounce tech let me get that off here so it doesn't contaminate that just doing some quick balance tags you know it's been a long day i've run a little over four and a half pounds and i don't have any hash i mean i have somehow but i want different you know what i'm talking about so how is everybody how's your day going what day is it [Music] okay that's the this is uh 120 through 159 not the cleanest or anything just trying to just trying to get a little something together to rip with you guys oh we can't do it like that can't see [ __ ] um [Music] not bad huh for some midzies so you're looking to learn about some dry [ __ ] mojo jojo well then i i have wonderful news for you i uh i finished uh shooting and there's just a little bit of editing for the um second video in the patreon series and aside from that i had all this uh dressed up stuff out and i had some material that i was working with so i went ahead and shut up oh comprehensive driveshift uh tutorial-ish video really a sort of revisiting because i have uh i watched a couple of bubble man's um old videos and some john brothel and a d420k and i realized my dry sip tack is nowhere near what it should be and um well to give you an idea why i'm feeling okay about it i'll just show you here in a second we pressed some rosin we're gonna show you [Music] and what we're doing [Music] wanted to see what kind of a quality product i can get from this and still um this this will still maintain a pretty a really reasonable view um this is 120 through 1 49 159 dry sift but this is in a 50 micron bag um a little bit larger than i typically use for hash but not too let's see what we got right here again not not to clean just trying to bounce any particulate through the screen that's smaller than 74 micron obviously boom playing drum solos over here [Music] i tried to use the camera last time but i guess you can't focus when you're live on youtube oh [ __ ] can you guys see this not bad for how long you saw we just worked on it 519 canada here shout out to my dry sipped masters from the north marcus of course uh john six grams i don't know i guess i could weigh it should we wear it yeah we can wear it why not oops we do have a little scale right here anyway so shout out to whoever the hell this company is no more batteries [ __ ] it usb rechargeable scale and i charged i've charged it one time and i've been using it for almost a month all right so we're going to weigh this the easy way [Music] make it a little bit of dry ice sit and really i was just bringing you guys in to take a break with me but when i set up the stream i noticed i had all that sift on the screen and i thought you guys might like to watch that hey four grams 3.95 looked like more didn't it all right guys it's good yeah i am tired i'm ready to take a dab i'm not sure how much i'm gonna get done after that but i have put in a very full day all right um [Music] you guys wanna you gotta [ __ ] it i guess we could press this real quick i do have some wonderful things to show you that i pressed earlier today from some dry sift that i spent much more time with um so if this stuff comes out amazing i'm going to be a little bit disappointed because why did i spend all that time making that stuff nah it's just there's absolute technique that cannot be denied and then of course there's the advantage to you know fully mature trichomes very dry fully mature trichomes in a very cold environment with very low humidity i mean in that setting you don't even really have to be this very good at this thing with all your variables perfect like that you're gonna you're gonna get some decent hatch but for uh mojo that said in the comments there a little bit ago about getting some screens or recently got some screens for driving oh what's happening here guys i can feel just a little bit of loose sift that's around it you know i don't want that on the parchment obviously okay now where's the first one the one i'm on i don't know we'll see if we get any yold out of this this actually is some 160 160 to 249. huge very high micron hash i don't think we're gonna press that but hey let's see what happens with this step as a matter of fact i know i want to press this because [Music] we want to try to stream i guess by a little bit of dry slipping i meant a lot sorry sorry sorry let's go let's go let's go [Music] all right here we [Music] that's a go too close how's everybody doing how's everybody doing it was a little fluffy you know what that points to unfortunately a high uh count of a capitate and stocks so that's contentment um only only contaminant would have it looking so fluffy like that we both thought it was like [ __ ] when you said seven grams i was like yeah probably maybe even a little more and then it was half all right guys so we're gonna first press the uh which one is this i can't remember which one was the bigger bag now the bigger bag was the last one so this is the 120-159 this is the 74-119 i think yes this is the 70 419 that's the stuff that we thought was seven grams but it's actually get my big fat head out of your way [Music] [Music] should be ready to go whoa those are some big comments yo what up austin video is called miz uh mecca mccall man static oh yeah [Music] so i don't know who so so dare you you must not have been here for the beginning i was talking about the marcus um adding to your driveshift quiver that i watched about six years ago and then i revisited over this past weekend and it was a really it was a wonderful reminder um no we're not of course i didn't just do static tech i don't have the time for that right now just want to make some dabs [Music] no they're actually four thousand dollars so sorry to i'm sorry to so sir dirty i love your information i appreciate the help and everything but you're a little bit incorrect there brother um yes of course the video at least i well i mean bubble man pro had had published tutorials on full mel dry sift and static tech six years ago so that makes sense as far as the drying being done with a freeze dryer oh yeah sure it's a great way to do it but old school microplaning and and drying um on cardboard honestly if you know what you're doing if you know how to keep your room cool and dry it can be very dope aside from that even whether or not you're freeze drying or not you're going to have to microplane um unless you're just going to stuff chunks of well you know i have no way of doing static technique the same thing as you were thinking security i'd like to check that yeah oh of course we know that's v man yep it is you're absolutely right sir dirty it is very simple the uh well there's the [ __ ] [Music] oh he's always doing it dude that's that's all that's like every single day for solving this bacon big he goes live for like four hours at a time and washes and presses and you know all that that's what's up yeah so depending on if you want a pharmaceutical freeze dryer which for the record if you're going to get one through low temp um and we are we're only talking about harvest rate i am not going to speak on anybody or any other company's freeze dryer if you're going to go through low temp you're not you're only going to be able to get a pharmaceutical one and they're not and that's not 2 000. they do have a small freeze dryer that's like it has three shelves it's very very small if you don't need a pump or anything like that if i remember correctly i think it's uh we could just look it up i think it's like 25 maybe maybe 3 500 but if i remember correctly actually i think the medium one is because i was looking at the medium one with a pump and it was going to be right here just over four just over four grand i'm so interested in that uh [Music] i love it i love it um yeah i'm so interested in this static tech austin what you got what you got that's new yeah you and that's don't even get me started on that oil free clown so you know dope about fire fire driveshift if you accidentally [ __ ] around and get and get caught answering some questions on youtube and just watching your [ __ ] burn there's the 120 micron obviously buttered to hell because how long i let it sit on the press but i don't think it's gonna hurt it [Music] all right let's press the big one and then let's go take a dab and then i need to get the [ __ ] out of here but i like to say dear tate because it reminds me of joe dirk [Music] oh that's right yeah okay a moderator i understand i'm sorry i've been so into reddit lately you guys that it's just usually i mean bops are mostly moderators over there but anyway i get what you mean now you got a blue ranch when you go live with them and you help them keep [ __ ] together [Music] i know homie i'm waiting for my taxes to come back so i can make skunk man austin god damn it yo if you don't know anything about skunk man sam you actually don't even know anything about triceps and sir dairy that's you seem very knowledgeable and i don't mean to say that to be rude but i actually you're pretty knowledgeable so you probably know who scott manson is marcus himself bubble man himself shouted out to scott manson without skunk man sam we would be we'd be a long way behind in the full mount [Music] there we go there we go probably let that guy warm up for a little bit too long but that's okay that's the beautiful thing about pressing at 155 degrees you got a little bit of yeah a little bit of leeway looks like there's a couple of you in here hope you guys are having a good day i am wrapping up my work week we're trying to anyway i'm gonna have to come back tomorrow of course but here we go let's get a little bit of frozen banana dry sip hash rosin glow for you again remember guys i didn't really clean it we certainly didn't break out any static tech we're just trying to get some dabs for me to get going with skunk man sam is the [ __ ] man just i gotta say it again austin you know what's up hey thanks mojo i laven if you're old school weed too you remember brett mavericks using the static tech on a pool table with the playing card brett maverick used mavic was that that's that's long enough static tech ago that that's before uh i was seeing people regularly doing it with books and dvds and things damn see i knew we had some crossover man i love solving this bacon bank he's such a cool dude and you ain't kidding i do need a netflix series and i'm down for that pay too um but he is such a cool dude and i just like what he's about um i of course i'm i'm kind of busy doing the same same similar stuff so because of that you know oh i have the timer set for 90 seconds i'm gonna press a little longer than that it just we're probably about 110 right now um [Music] also i don't want to get too crazy with the pressure because i just want this to be fire i don't really care about you um that's a shitty thing to say yeah but solving this bacon baby's such a he's such a cool dude and he's just he just seems to be so like the thing i some people are like so you could say that but they're just so nice i don't get that with him i get to know [ __ ] from him i like that you don't need to be [ __ ] nice for me to be a fan of yours you need to be about your game and he is he's about his game i just don't know personally i get silly with trying to be nice to everybody again some presses you just don't [ __ ] care about the yield this was on the plant how long ago did we start streaming 21 minutes ago this was bud a little over 30 minutes ago now let's see here's our first press this is our one yeah this is the big microphone i think that stuff's going to be better 35 40 minutes ago for sure this stuff was flour in a plastic bin in a tupperware you know what's that you know what time it is only i had a [ __ ] rig ready over here [Music] better not take forever geez my desk is messy i'm so sorry you guys let's uh just bring you in on about that much of it so you don't have to look right at all oh i know what i want to show you so that's the this is a little bit of frozen banana dressing pass rosin that we just pressed together we made it [ __ ] around with the card didn't that card moved it around a little bit let some of the let's let gravity do most of the work for us and uh there we got those two processors from it i couldn't absolutely get a second press and i will later earlier today what did i press oh this is nightwing so here's some night queen dry swift rosin that i pressed a couple hours ago and this is the second press i never [ __ ] with second presses unless it's good hash good hash will press two sometimes even three times if you're not if you're if you're doing short presses or whatever if you're [ __ ] it out you shouldn't have to press it three times but anyway i just want to share that a little bit a little bit a little with you we got some super fire rosins for dab on and um we made them all from the plant to the parchment ready for the bag and it's just 45 minutes tops where are you where are you oh you guys wanna get silly little slurper dab i just saw the case over here don't do that that's how you lose a marble all right guys i gotta have that gauge up all right how we doing how we doing how we doing just so you know i can't see you and i have no idea what the hell is going on but i love you guys [Music] [Music] all righty then [Music] let's uh let's start this [ __ ] off right i'm going to start it off with that second press from the uh from the night queen oh [ __ ] i forgot that i'm working one thing [Music] and by working i mean taking a break i like to take a break about every six to eight hours yes i do work 12 hour days 10 to 12 hour days today is going to be a pretty short day though i'll be out of here i'll be out here right around 10 hours um anyway yes we'll slow down the recovery there a little bit so i can play with you guys for just a minute come on guys i think i just want to look at the picture of that deer pooping now so again give me something let me know what's up give me something to read in there sir dirty had all sorts of good information i do i hate that i'm so uh contrarian and so oppositional and i'm sorry about that but it seems like sometimes like somebody i mean regardless of whether or not he's right about the price we can agree to disagree or just look it up or whatever but i don't know why i have to oh no you're not right he [ __ ] cares if any of us are going to buy a freeze driver we'll find out by the time we check out you know what i'm saying you know what i'm saying there we go that blazer though all right so we're going to start this off with a excruciating dab of the night queen second press tricep hashgraph oh i barely even smoked last night i certainly haven't smoked anything yet today i've been working for since 10 when it's about 7 30. [ __ ] i'm at nine and a half hours now it looks like it's gonna be more like an eleven-hour day whatever where's that second graph that's not it that's not it that's a good problem to have right you like that you guys this is the other reason why i want to do a dab with a second press to start and you might be able to pick up you guys having fun watching me let me watch when i finally get my youtube page pulled up here on my laptop i'll be sitting here by myself i mean i don't know how anybody wants this [ __ ] i gotta be [ __ ] annoying as all hell but i love you guys and i love sharing my little bits of knowledge about how to make hashish with you well and don't worry guys if i knock this rig over digger gave this one to me um for court sales i want to say three years ago so it's a decent ring but it didn't cost anything surprise says oh that's me right there i was like i call myself a surprise set all right here we go oh that's that's actually a very big dab already cheers ladies and gentlemen oh my god i'm not even gonna be able to dab the president that's some night queen and really it's like trim then keith that i threw over a screen real quick and it was so terpy i almost couldn't even i really whoa that must be good where there's the very turkey dab one of you what whatever mcafee any cheers come on dude my antivirus pop up was cracking the comments and then thank you elite uh 27 m uh 27 32 and four and that's for the regular and that's in us dollars iso um but that's just a regular freeze driver it is a food grade freezer option but it's not the pharmaceutical ones which have way way way more um options and settings that you can play with as far as dry times dry times depth of vacuum temperature sublimation is a really amazing thing got me by the nose it really did too man it's like uh and honestly that's the oh that's the second press um mixed micron or whatever it didn't it doesn't have a very clean melt to be perfectly honest with you i'm a little less than impressed with that there's absolutely no char or particulate or anything it's just a little darker than i think it should know anyway let me set this down over here or not shut this down oh man yo night queen [ __ ] give me a break jesus i have never experienced that strain being that loud before um i i've washed it and pressed it i have some sugar of it it's just amazing but never had that happen jesus this frozen banana [ __ ] looks amazing this is not frozen now that's good man all right there we go now this should be the bee's knees wait that's the night queen again i can't do that it's definitely gonna be good that's the 120. the 120 to 159 oh all right here we go no he said it was 2k for a freeze driver and it's 2700 and if you're in canada that's more like three um so he was off by 50 number one and then number two that's if you if you have a pump if you need a pump too it's more unless i'm mistaken if that's the price with the oil pump the other thing is that anybody trying to get one of these to use it in a setting like i'm trying to use it in is not looking for an oil-free pump the oil free pump is like an extra six to eight hundred bucks so at that point it's 35 for the small one and for the record that freeze dryer is so [ __ ] small you're gonna be pissed at yourself for spending three thousand dollars on something that small when you could have spent four thousand on something that is significantly better but still goes back to my point i just i don't know why i always got to be right anyway that's fair and honestly that's the thing is if it's a thing to waste and you're like a hobbyist or whatever damn you're really going in on your hobby but for me i look at it as like well why would i spend two to three grand on something that then when i recoup the value for it it's too small so i mean um freeze dryer is on the schedule not sure what size i'll be getting but we'll see you know what's up it really does man what kind of class is on a dab right what would i say and then aside from that hello annie yeehaw right man damn i [ __ ] but i'm almost scared to go in on another job but we got but number one i need to wrap it up and number two come on jesus man i got dab sweats and [ __ ] my gloves all hashy man jesus and my hands are clammy now because they were in the glove that's probably why i was so hot it couldn't have anything to do with that dab i just took i'm sure it had to do with the gloves all right ladies and gentlemen you know how much i love you um i mean if you don't know who's being silly if sir dirty's still here let's haven't seen a comic i'm gonna walk but if you're stupid still here looks like we're going to split the difference um we're both no i mean to be fair i don't know i don't know actually i don't know about that before i think i just said they're not too um but also i was speaking about the pharmaceutical freezer regardless it is the morton salt girl except it's the morton salt girl taken and done by slinger which marble slinger is a glassblower but then he takes it and he puts an assault rifle in her hands and we have a salt girl that makes sense and this is a special february edition this one's called oh this one's called rain and blood that's right that was the other thing the slayer rain and blood um yeah i love slinger [ __ ] um but this is a this is the picasso version of the design super cool first time i saw it i was like that's like a morton salt girl and then i realized he's holding a gun and i'm like a salt assault like a salt oh god and i've been in love with it ever since because i'm an old nerd and when i see some [ __ ] like that and i think it's cool i never get over it jesus christ look at this [ __ ] frozen bananas you guys it's on was he i didn't know that was i didn't know that was with it but at the same time i was too you know hope you're still here if you're still here let me say something um that's what i was saying about the split the difference oh my god look at that melt you guys need to see the color this rosin is melting into uh [ __ ] dude i went in hot we went in just under 600 degrees holy [ __ ] you guys whoa hey what's up austin my homies in the northeast you know i love you i'm saying that a lot of them anyway that is a beautiful amount and if we were if you remember i was out of the right micron bag so i had to press that at 50. that's the 74 to 119 pressed in a 50 micron bag almost like the same size um you know not really but just a little bit so the fact that i knew that was going to be a little charry or maybe dark on the end as it did get a little char charlie when it dried up or finished but i cannot get over the color of that when it melted down was [ __ ] beautiful and it maintained its color for a minute tastes great tastes great it's a very interesting terpene profile um very very unique for me uh well you guys know it's got to be unique for me because every time i take a dab or a hit of anything i [ __ ] cough for 10 minutes and cry and that isn't happening so it must be different all right guys i was going to say have a great day but that dad was so [ __ ] delicious so delicious just like dog food tastes exactly like it smells delicious all right that's the low mic that's the that's the mids frozen bananas compared to this because this is way way way larger micron hash pressed out of a 50 micron bag so this is certain oh my god what do you guys think drop it i don't know sorry guys this [ __ ] is and i'd like to smoke something with some of my homies back home in missoula how is annie doing man thank you mom um reached out to me about um tincture help for either a sick person or a sick dog or i can't remember exactly but i wasn't able to find the uh micro encapsulation article i was looking for anyway uh it's been a while i'm glad you made it over so if anybody has the chance to try this strain frozen bananas this is my absolute first very very first experience with it [ __ ] uh don't get me wrong the guy that i the guy that i work with is an incredible brother absolutely incredible of the highest calorie so you know if you get your wheat from somebody that all the strains look the same don't be necessarily excited about frozen bananas it might not be that different this is very very exciting for me because it's so different than what i'm used to eddie peace 340. well that means it's 6 40 in california and almost 10 o'clock on the east coast cheers ladies and gentlemen that's exactly how you spell it with a k and one l oh my god wait you guys know i like that i like the flare for the dramatic but i tend not to exaggerate especially not when it comes to ash no cap definitely some of the best cash i have had hashtag that i've smoked so far this year period i don't care if it's from a hyperzone maker or if it's from the dispensary down the street this frozen banana ah find me um 120 to 159 the micron is dry ships hash rising is [ __ ] wild i cannot explain this taste to you guys i guess it is kind of mild like the way a banana is like a mild fruit but yo for real grizz that's what's up man austin where are you that's super cool yeah caspell's though also california's the only town county whatever it's the only place in montana that has a chick-fil-a so if you know what i'm talking about when i say there's nothing quite like the taste of [ __ ] hate oh you can only get it in council i got jokes open your heart let the hate out oh oh you guys i gotta lose some weight i gained weight during quarantine and then i just uh gained a little more love to michigan oh good luck with that because to be honest with you this is the problem the dab before this one i was supposed to quit and get and just finish what i need to do and be done but this [ __ ] is so good man so good nah anyway i hope you all have a wonderful week and hope you all have a wonderful weekend uh for those of you that are patrons or interested in becoming a patreon i'm sorry for those of you that are interested in patreon or are already patrons um i published uh one of the first of an eight video series um a couple days ago i've i have minutes maybe an hour left of editing for the uh part two part three is going to be wild it's going to be a celebration so far we're all only into hydrocarbon content but episode four if you can't tell from all these parchments around me is a dry sift and dry sift pressing episode so we got content coming go over and check it out if you like i and i say this because i encourage you those of you that are interested to just to go over and check it out it's you certainly you know pick the tier that you want with for whatever much you want to support me if you if you don't really give a [ __ ] about that and you just want to see what but what's up with the videos or if they're worth the money whatever then just do the small one you know either way you get to see with everything i just ask that anybody that has the ability and has any interest in helping to support me does that like mr david brazier has been like a [ __ ] high-level tear patron for a year and i mean i've while i think he's i think he's the longest that couple a couple of you guys have been rode with me and it's amazing but mr brazier from alaska i think he absolutely holds the record yes sir i'm gonna try i know this much up until um when i came to work today i had always had some hats you know what that or some oil or whatever but didn't really have any fire rotting feeling like my weekend's gonna be pretty sweet now let's get it started right cheers ladies and gentlemen after this i am gonna rock and roll and go ahead and finish my day pardon me i do encourage you to check out patreon if you're interested in processing a tutorial um hash tutorial but essentially processing tutorial content if you want to learn how to make some stuff make some high high quality stuff uh like there's there's a lot i number one i encourage you if you're gonna get into it to get a notebook my videos are you think my videos are long here the number two that's being published should be published tomorrow it's one right now i think i'm going to be able to knock down another couple minutes so if i should be able to get it to around one hour and 50 minutes it's just under two hours it's a [ __ ] movie i mean but it sucks and it's not entertaining however the amount of information in it is is probably pretty valuable um again check it out if you're interested if you're not i'm always here on youtube you can always email 710.consultations gmail.com you can always email the 7th extractions at gmail.com you're interested in booking a consultation and i'm actually i'm commenting from my 710 consultation so there it is 710.consultations gmail.com or you can text that number if you're interested in booking a conversation and for those of you that are interested in going over and checking out patreon that's great because i feel like i owe so much to the people that have supported me over the last year and the amount of content i i just fell short on being able to publish on time at all um i have this very very very comprehensive eight video series that i'm working on now and when it's finished it may be more like nine or ten videos but when it's finished i'm definitely going to turn off enrollment for a while um it's i uh it's hard when you finish a ton of content and then you need to get back to you know to work and or whatever you're doing and you have a new patreon patron or a subscriber or something come in and then you know their first question is when are you going to post something and i'm going like in my mind i'm thinking like i'm not even trying to shoot anything for a month so it's it's uh it's an interesting thing i'm not the kind of i'm not the kind of uh creator on patreon that like has a podcast going or anything that you would want you know that you check out regularly but there is a significant amount of information available to you right now and when i'm finished my a video series the amount of information that's available to you for the cheapest monthly subscription which is insanely cheap i think it's a pretty good deal i wish somebody would have put all that information together for me and been like give me a couple bucks and you can watch all these videos for a month all right guys yes you're absolutely right i didn't want so austin thank you um as far as things like if you might be interested in them like merchandise uh some personal time with me one-on-one stuff like if that's the kind of thing you're interested in there are some advantages to the opportunities but cheers ladies and gentlemen frozen bananas oh i'm under the same name i am everywhere brother however i do think it is all just one word i don't know why i spaced that either jesus that [ __ ] is so good i want to try a dab of it and save peace and kill the stream and that's my third day oh i love you guys but i gotta get back to it and get it wrapped up again i hope you have a wonderful weekend should anybody have any questions comments concerns anything feel free to go ahead and throw that in the comments section below and aside from that if you have any uh interest in a consultation inquiry you can email 710 dot consultations at gmail.com or you can text the number that i wrote in the chat 406-500-6698 peace", "Ox6_cyBjkng": "I think they say not really think man killing for fun of your place darling she's acting like there's love but this is oh you
